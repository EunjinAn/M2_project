As we know, the acquisition of surface EMG signal is non-invasive, which provides a better evaluation index for rehabilitation training in the medical process. By establishing the relationship between grip force and surface electromechanical signals, the effect of rehabilitation training can be evaluated directly while reducing the types of sensors used. Firstly, the experimental equipment are introduced, which are utilized to carry out simultaneous acquisition of surface EMG signals and forces. Then, the traditional features of sEMG and the corresponding algorithms are illustrated, based on this, supplementing the energy eigenvalue with wavelet analysis and fuzzy entropy. In which, fuzzy entropy is effective in characterizing muscle fatigue that can effectively reduce the impact of muscle fatigue on force assessment. Finally, combining fuzzy logic implication and neural network, the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system is designed, which is trained by extracted feature vectors. The experimental result shows the method used in this paper can effectively predict the grip force. Further, force prediction based on sEMG can be used to guide rehabilitation therapy in virtual space, combined with an electrical stimulator. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","ANFIS; Fuzzy entropy; Grip strength forecast; Rehabilitation therapy; sEMG","Adaptive control systems; Computer control systems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Entropy; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Human computer interaction; Muscle; ANFIS; Fuzzy entropy; Grip strength; Rehabilitation therapy; sEMG; Fuzzy inference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069864479

A distinctive feature of the platform architecture is its modular and interdependent system of core and complementary components bound together by design rules and an overarching value proposition. Accordingly, we conceptualize platforms as meta-organizations, or “organizations of organizations” that are less formal and less hierarchical structures than firms, and yet more closely coupled than traditional markets. To function successfully, however, platforms require coordination among multiple participants not all of whose interests are aligned. These organizational features of platforms raise many interesting and complex strategic challenges and hold implications for how platforms compete. In this paper, we discuss some of the most salient features of platform ecosystems as meta-organizations, specifically in terms of the sources of authority or power in the ecosystem, the motivation and incentives a platform creates to attract participants, and its governance and coordination structures. We then consider how papers appearing in this special issue inform us about the effects of these features on platform competition along three distinct dimensions: (a) with traditional incumbents as platforms enter and establish themselves in new markets, (b) with other platforms to secure an advantageous market position, and (c) with the different participants on the platform to share the value that has been created jointly. We close by identifying some promising directions for future research. Managerial summary: Platform ecosystems have spurred new products and services, sparked innovation, and improved economic efficiency in various industries and technology sectors. A distinctive feature of the platform architecture is its modular and interdependent system of core and complementary components bound together by design rules and an overarching value proposition. This makes platform ecosystems an organizational form on its own (a “meta-organization”), neither possessing the hierarchical instruments of a firm, nor the largely uncoordinated decisionmaking of markets. Successful platform ecosystems require coordination among multiple participants with possibly conflicting interests. We discuss some of the most salient features of platform ecosystems as meta-organizations, specifically in terms of the sources of authority or power in the ecosystem, the motivation and incentives a platform creates to attract participants, and its governance and coordination structures. These features affect how platform ecosystems compete: i) with a traditional incumbent, ii) with other platform ecosystems, and iii) between different participants of the same platform ecosystem. The articles published in this special issue speak to different aspects of platform competition from the perspective of organization design. © 2020 The Authors.

However, there is a lack of research on how the unintended consequences of AI integrated business analytics (AI-BA) influence a firm’s overall competitive advantage. In this backdrop, this study aims to identify how factors, such as AI-BA opacity, suboptimal business decisions and perceived risk are responsible for a firm’s operational inefficiency and competitive disadvantage. Drawing on the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and contingency theory, the proposed research model captures the components and effects of an AI-BA opacity on a firm’s risk environment and negative performance. The data were gathered from 355 operational, mid-level and senior managers from various service sectors across all different size organisations in India. The results indicated that lack of governance, poor data quality, and inefficient training of key employees led to an AI-BA opacity. It then triggers suboptimal business decisions and higher perceived risk resulting in operational inefficiency. The findings show that operational inefficiency significantly contributes to negative sales growth and employees’ dissatisfaction, which result in a competitive disadvantage for a firm. The findings also highlight the significant moderating effect of contingency plan in the nomological chain. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Artificial intelligence; business analytics; firm dis-performance; firm’s competitiveness; operational inefficiency; Patrick Mikalef, Aleš Popovic, Jenny Eriksson Lundström and Kieran Conboy","Advanced Analytics; Competition; Opacity; Personnel training; Sales; Service industry; Business analytics; Business decisions; Competitive advantage; Contingency theory; Dynamic capabilities; Integrated business; Resource-based view; Unintended consequences; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111903831

Uber entered each city to jump-start network effects by establishing cognitive legitimacy while deepening a sociopolitical legitimacy crisis that emerged due to mismatches between its business model and existing regulations. Operating between existing categories, Uber used a series of interrelated market and nonmarket strategies, which we label as liminal movement, to generate cognitive and sociopolitical legitimacy. Managerial Summary: Sharing economy ventures based on digital platforms confront market and institutional challenges in each context they enter. On entry, these ventures must rapidly build an ecosystem of users and service providers, and engage with local regulators, administrators, and social groups in order to gain acceptance. The key to a venture's survival and success is liminal movement or in other words, its ability to adapt its digital platform and business model to continually leverage opportunities and address concerns as they emerge. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","business models; ecosystems; platforms; regulatory entrepreneurship; sharing economy","Management; Planning; Business modeling; Business models; Cognitive legitimacies; Digital platforms; Network effects; Non-market strategy; Service provider; Social groups; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083714316

We, to our knowledge, are the first to construct a framework based on multiple time scales and market conditions to quantify the interrelationship between the carbon futures and green bond markets. Specifically, we estimate it from short-, medium-, and long-term perspectives and different market conditions by combining the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) and two quantile methods to decompose the sequences into various frequencies and quantiles. We find that the carbon futures price unilaterally Granger causes the green bond index and empirically analyzes the asymmetric impact of the carbon futures with a two-dimensional quantile model constructed by the quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression approach. We find positive effects of the carbon futures in the medium to long term and erratic performance in the short term. The effects are more pronounced when both markets are in an extreme state.

Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart ""Predict, then Optimize"" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure-that is, its objective and constraints-for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Empirical results report a positive and significant association among perceived behavioral control (PBC), perceived environmental concern (PEC), perceived monitory benefits (PMB), and intention to save energy (ISE). Positive anticipated emotions (PAE) is found to be a significant predictor of ISE and energy-saving behavior (ESB). As a step further, we extend the analysis to find the moderating effect of perceived COVID-19 disruptiveness (PCD) between the relationship of ISE and ESB.

The most powerful predictors are selected through the dimension-reduction mechanism of the two models, while potential differences of the statistically significant predictors for different quantiles of carbon returns are carefully considered. First, we find that the proposed models outperform a series of competing ones with respect to prediction accuracy. Second, impacts of the selected predictors over the carbon price distribution are estimated through a quantile approach, which outperforms the mean shrinkage model in our case with data featured by a non-normal distribution. Specifically, the Brent spot price, the crude oil closing stock in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in the UK are found to impact carbon futures returns only in extreme conditions with a strong asymmetric feature. Importantly, our estimators remain robust against the extreme event caused by the Covid-19.

We use a difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock. Results: Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United States, although total research productivity increased by 35%, female academics’ productivity dropped by 13.2% relative to that of male academics. We also show that this intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for assistant professors and for academics in top-ranked universities and is found in six other countries. Managerial implications: Our work points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It also helps organizations realize the potential unintended consequences that can arise from telecommuting. © 2021 INFORMS","COVID-19; gender inequality; research productivity; telecommuting","Behavioral research; Productivity; Academic activities; Academic productivity; Academic research; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Gender equity; Gender inequality; OpenAccess; Problem definition; Research productivity; COVID-19",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132232295

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to widespread health and economic-related uncertainty. In this study, we investigate the magnitude and the timing of the impact of COVID-19 related uncertainty on returns and volatility for 20 national energy indices and a global energy index using ARCH/GARCH models. We propose a novel “overall impact of uncertainty” (OIU) measure, explained using a natural phenomenon analogy of the overall impact of a rainstorm, to gauge the magnitude and intensity of the impact of uncertainty on energy sector returns. Drawing upon economic psychology, COVID-19 related uncertainty is measured in terms of searches for information relating to COVID-19 as captured by Google search trends. Our results show that the energy sectors of countries further west from the outbreak of the virus in China are impacted to a greater extent by COVID-19 related uncertainty. A similar observation is made for net energy and oil exporters relative to importers. We also find that the impact of uncertainty on most national energy sectors intensified and then weakened as the pandemic evolved. Additional analysis confirms that COVID-19 uncertainty is part of the composite set of factors that drive energy sector returns over the COVID-19 period although its importance has declined over time. © 2021","COVID-19; Energy sector; Overall impact of uncertainty (OIU) measure; Stock return volatility; Stock returns; Uncertainty","Financial markets; Investments; Search engines; Storms; Viruses; COVID-19; Energy indexes; Energy sector; Overall impact of uncertainty measure; Return volatilities; Stock return volatility; Stock returns; Uncertainty; Uncertainty measures; Uncertainty analysis; COVID-19; rainstorm; uncertainty analysis; virus; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117749373

A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics, making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behavior of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","COVID-19; Decision making; Exponential smoothing; Pandemic; Time series forecasting; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098094747

This paper investigates the impact of the implementation of Industry 4.0 with specific emphasis on digital transformation on the sustainability dimensions of European manufacturing industries. In doing so, we propose a framework to identify the implications of Industry 4.0 on the reconciliation of the firm’s existing and new dynamic capabilities, competencies, and market requirements to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Using a multiple case research design, we study six European manufacturing companies, including aerospace manufacturing (AM) and electronic component and systems (ECS) manufacturing. The novelty of our study lies in developing a set of theoretical propositions that reveals interrelations between Industry 4.0, the dynamic capabilities of the firm and distinct dimensions of sustainability. Our findings show that the reconciliation of dynamic capabilities mediates the impact of Industry 4.0 on economic, environmental, and social aspects.

Yet although such “social-mission platforms” are equipped to facilitate a high number of arms-length transactions, they are conversely ill-equipped to provide the necessary consensus which typically characterizes successful examples of cross-sector collaboration. Employing an in-depth archival case study of a civic crowdfunding platform, we surface a process model of social-mission platform creation, which exposes the dilemmas such platforms encounter as they attempt to navigate user growth, and the importance of institutional infrastructure for overcoming these dilemmas. These findings and our emergent model thus contribute new theory regarding the creation of digital platforms for enabling cross-sector collaboration and social innovation, while bridging the emerging body of research on platforms with institutional theory. Managerial Summary: Developing a digital platform for social good requires operators to maintain control over their mission as they grow, while working with actors from across sectors. While the economics of the platform may be clear, the social infrastructure to ensure effective and mission-aligned interaction between different segments of the platform needs to be developed. In our case study of a civic crowdfunding platform, we demonstrate how this platform strategically generates and promotes understandings of its boundaries, creates bridges between diverse stakeholders necessary for participation, and provides blueprints to shape and standardize platform interactions. We also discuss the potential susceptibility of social-mission platforms to experience mission drift as they grow, the existential threat that such drift poses in this context, and the ways that organizations might overcome this threat. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","civic crowdfunding; cross-sector collaboration; digital platforms; institutional infrastructure; social innovation; social-mission platforms","Management; Planning; civic crowdfunding; Cross-sector collaborations; Digital platforms; institutional infrastructure; Social innovations; social-mission platforms; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075753905

However, the effects of tourism development and structural change on environmental quality are yet to be explored in detail. Hence, the present work evaluates the dynamics of tourism development and structural change on emissions of CO2 as an environmental quality, representative by endogenizing economic progress, consumption of energy, and structural break in India. Toward the empirical front, this study relies on quarterly time series data for 1995Q1–2016Q4 within an approach of bounds testing for cointegration due to its simulation capacity for integration order of the study variables. The emanated outcomes reveal the long-term association between the variables of interest. After validating the long-term correspondence among the variables, the ARDL-based long-run results show that tourism development worsens the quality of the environment, whereas transition in the structure of the economy cause for improving the quality of the environment and structural break in the series shows an insignificant role in carbon emissions. Moreover, it is revealed that economic growth improves the quality of the environment, and consumption of energy exhibits a deleterious association with environmental quality. These findings’ robustness is confirmed using fully modified/dynamic OLS and canonical cointegrating regression. Therefore, the study suggests that policymakers must ensure a sustainable tourism practice to reap environmental sustainability. Similarly, the government should promote investment in the service sector to maintain a desirable environmental quality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","CO2 emissions; India; Structural change; Tourism","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; ecotourism; environmental quality; fuel consumption; service sector; structural change; time series analysis; tourism development; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111942622

While computational algorithms have been developed to deal with large volumes of data (decision making units, inputs, and outputs) under the conventional DEA, valuable information hidden in big data that are represented by network structures should be extracted by DEA. These network structures, e.g., transportation and logistics systems, encompass a broader range of inter-linked metrics that cannot be modelled by conventional DEA. It is proposed that network DEA is related to the value dimension of big data. It is shown that network DEA is different from standard DEA, although it bears the name of DEA and some similarity with conventional DEA. Network DEA is big data enabled analytics (big DEA) when multiple (performance) metrics or attributes are linked through network structures. These network structures are too large or complex to be dealt with by conventional DEA. Unlike conventional DEA that are solved via linear programming, general network DEA corresponds to nonconvex optimization problems. This represents opportunities for developing techniques for solving non-linear network DEA models. Areas such as transportation and logistics system as well as supply chains have a great potential to use network DEA in big data modeling. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Big data; Composite index; Data enabled analytics; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Efficiency; Performance; Productivity; Transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086166588

We find that the promotion effect of energy consumption on economic growth changes over time, as evidenced by the inverted U shape of the relationship. Moreover, the non-parametric model captures such an effect better than the parametric model.

It also uses quantitative analysis to examine the impact of CTTI4.0 information on financial performance. The analysis shows that strategic investment decision-making (SIDM) practices for CTTI4.0 have accelerated over the period, and these practices vary in industry sectors. Furthermore, it finds that CTTI4.0 disclosure has a positive impact on financial performance. In addition, it finds that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices moderate the relationship between CTTI4.0 disclosure and financial performance. This indicates that firms with better ESG performance tend to be more engaged in CTTI4.0 disclosure and better financial performance simultaneously.

The challenges and opportunities for sustainable waste reuse and recycling are emphasized, and direction is provided for practices. Many developing and emerging countries have been attempting to address solid waste management problems and serious restrictions on material reuse and recycling activities. However, it is not well developed, and reuse and recycling efforts have not yet been well implemented due to weak economic and political institution levels. This study aims to propose a sustainable solid waste management model and address opportunities and challenges for waste reuse and recycling in a developing country. A hybrid approach is adopted using a systematic data-driven analysis comprising content analyses, system uncertainty and complexity, the fuzzy Delphi method, interpretive structural modeling, and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory. The results show that 19 valid indicators are congregated into five aspects, in which circular resource management, societal requirements, and municipal sustainability are causative aspects with the capability to improve sustainable solid waste management as it regards waste reuse and recycling. The top prominent indicators helping to enhance practices are the circular economy, the informal sector, material flow analysis, policy restrictions, waste treatment technologies.

Unlike the PCA that maximizes the common variation of the predictors, the sPCA assigns more weight to those predictors with stronger forecasting power. In a general factor framework, we show that, under some appropriate conditions on data, the sPCA forecast beats the PCA forecast, and when these conditions break down, extensive simulations indicate that the sPCA still has a large chance to outperform the PCA.

The empirical analysis employs a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model using a panel of Chinese provinces during the 2000–2010 time period. In support of a partial crowding-out view, public R&D subsidies allocated to large and medium-sized enterprises (LMEs) are found to increase total R&D inputs proxied by total R&D personnel, despite reducing privately-financed R&D inputs. Specifically, we find that an increase of R&D subsidies by one standard deviation decreases private R&D expenditures in LMEs by 6.5%, but increases total R&D personnel in LMEs by 2.6%. We also find evidence that the effects of R&D subsidies extend beyond their main effect on corporate R&D, promoting technological upgrading, capital deepening, and economic growth. We further find evidence suggesting some misallocation of research-oriented public funds. The findings help shed important insights into the ongoing debate regarding the role of the state in promoting innovation in a transitioning economy context. © 2021","China; Panel VAR; R&D inputs; R&D subsidies; Regional development","Economics; Personnel; Regional planning; Value engineering; Auto-regressive; China; Medium sized enterprise; Medium-sized enterprise; Panel vector autoregressive; Regional development; Research and development; Research and development input; Research and development subsidy; Economic and social effects; economic growth; investment; panel data; regional development; research and development; small and medium-sized enterprise; subsidy system; technological development; vector autoregression; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120333439

The characteristics of the green supply chain network, however, can encourage some companies to exhibit “free-riding” behavior, participating without being willing to reduce emissions directly themselves. This paper applies an evolutionary game model to a two-level green supply chain composed of green suppliers and green manufacturers in order to analyze a variety of internal and external factors that affect the behavior of both parties in the game, and thence numerically simulate the evolution and stability trend of coordinated reductions in emissions. The results identify many cases of system evolution but the only stable evolution strategy is when both (1) the sum of collaborative emission reduction benefits and government subsidies is greater than the sum of collaborative emission reduction input costs and ""free rider"" benefits, and (2) the increased rate of unilateral emission reduction benefits is greater than the ratio of costs to original benefits. Income arising from collaborative reductions in emissions, enterprise original income, income from unilateral reductions in emissions increase ratio, government subsidy coefficient and achievement reward base can directly affect the system evolution path. The larger these value, the greater the probability of green suppliers and green manufacturers choosing collaborative reductions in emissions, and the faster the system convergence speed. Only the imposition of regulatory punishments above the threshold will affect the ""free riding"" behavior of enterprises and drive the upstream and downstream enterprises of the green supply chain to reduce emissions faster. © 2022","Coordinated emission reduction; Evolutionary game; Government regulation; Green supply chain","Cost reduction; Environmental regulations; Manufacture; Supply chains; % reductions; Coordinated emission reduction; Emission reduction; Evolutionary games; Free-riding; Government regulation; Government subsidies; Green supplier; Green supply chain; System evolution; Emission control; emission control; environmental economics; governance approach; numerical model; supply chain management; trend analysis; achievement; article; game; government; government regulation; probability; punishment; reward; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127164632

Results show that green innovation improves GTFP. The impact of green innovation on GTFP is heterogeneous, depending on patent types and characteristics of enterprises. Additionally, technical gap influence the impacts of green innovation on enterprise GTFP. It has a threshold effect in heavy-pollution enterprises. Green innovation inhibits enterprise GTFP when the technical gap is less than 132.7233. When the technical gap is more than 142.4535, green innovation promotes the enterprise GTFP.

A multistep research methodology was adopted by the authors, including (1) literature analysis and semistructured interviews with 40 industry experts to identify a comprehensive list of construction themes and factors affected by the pandemic; (2) survey data collection from 388 industry professionals to quantify the significance and influence of each identified factor; (3) Cronbach's alpha test to check the reliability of the survey; (4) fuzzy inference system to assess the impact of the pandemic on each construction theme and factor; and (5) Mann-Whitney U-test to examine the perceived impact by the public and private sectors. Results show that the pandemic has impacted a total of 16 construction factors grouped under four construction themes, including contractual implications, construction financial market, and supply chain operations, as well as safety and risk management, where the latter is the most impacted theme. The factors impacted the most by the pandemic are safety management measures, interpretation of the contract language, building materials prices, risk management practices, construction materials, construction labor, and construction subcontractors. Also, the findings of the fuzzy model show significant difference in the captured impact of the pandemic between the public and private sectors. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a foothold foundation for researchers and decision makers to enhance investigating the effect of the pandemic with its deep uncertainties in relation to developing countries. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Building materials; Commerce; Construction industry; Decision making; Fuzzy inference; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Safety engineering; Supply chains; Surveys; Case-studies; Construction markets; Construction projects; Construction sectors; Legislative changes; Multisteps; Public and private sector; Research methodologies; Safety management; Supply-chain disruptions; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116887481

In the era of COVID-19, particularly, consumers tend to rely more on digital attributes of social media platforms for their decision-making process by reducing the physical touchpoint. Responding to this ongoing trend, this study investigates how fitness YouTube channel attributes and fitness YouTuber attributes influence flow experience, satisfaction, and behavioral intention of YouTubers who work out at home via a fitness YouTube channel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the social media literature and the cognitive appraisal theory, this research formulates a research model that specifies the influence of three dimensions of fitness YouTube channel attributes (i.e., social interaction, information quality, and visual content) and three dimensions of fitness YouTuber attributes (i.e., social attractiveness, physical attractiveness, and attitude homophily) on flow experience, YouTube channel satisfaction, and behavioral intention in the context of YouTube. This study recruited participants in the United States who currently work out via a fitness YouTube channel through three waves of data collection during the COVID-19 era. The empirical results revealed that flow experience was significantly affected by information quality, visual content, and physical attractiveness. Also, YouTube channel satisfaction was significantly affected by social interaction, information quality, and visual content. Lastly, behavioral intention was significantly affected by flow experience and YouTube channel satisfaction. Based on the findings, this study proposes meaningful implications for the extant literature and social media industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attributes; Behavioral intention; Fitness; Flow experience; Influencer; YouTuber","COVID-19; decision making; life satisfaction; media role; social media; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115013045

As the oil market has been historically known to associate with other financial and commodity markets, it is important to see if oil connects differently with prominent financial assets during market turbulence caused by a war. Thus, we make the first attempt to examine how oil connects with prominent financial assets, namely bonds, bitcoin, U.S. dollar, gold, and stocks, using intra-day data, before and during the war. We find that connectedness is stronger during the war than before it. Oil becomes a net transmitter of spillovers during the war, unlike in the pre-war era when it is characterized as a net receiver of spillovers. Also, whereas the net directional pairwise results suggest heterogeneity regarding how oil connects individually with each of the remaining assets before the war, oil has a strong spillover effect on all of them during the war. However, the spillover effect is transitory, as it dies out over time. The findings are robust to intra-day data of different frequency, and have suitable implications for short-term investors, and further agendas for future research in relation to the impacts of the war are provided. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Connectedness; Financial assets; Oil; Russia-Ukraine war","Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Commodities market; Connectedness; Financial assets; Oil; Oil market; Russia-ukraine war; Second World War; Spillover effects; Ukraine; US dollar; Military operations; commodity market; financial crisis; financial market; future prospect; oil production; spillover effect; war; Russian Federation; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128882752

The underlying idea is that growth, development, technological change, income inequality, spatial disparities, and resilience are the visible outcomes of hidden systemic interactions. The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the OECD, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework.

The seaborne trade is expected to continue its growth despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The International Maritime Organization considers the amount of emissions produced by oceangoing ships as substantial. Shipping lines have to explore innovative and effective alternatives to meet challenging emission reduction targets. This study proposes a new type of collaborative agreements amongst shipping lines and marine terminal operators, where the shipping line is not only able to select the marine terminal for the ship service at every port of the shipping route but also request the appropriate arrival time window and handling rate. A multi-objective mathematical model is developed to capture the proposed collaborative agreements. The first objective of the model minimizes the cost components that are mostly driven by the economic perspectives, while the second one directly captures the environmental perspectives as well. A novel customized exact multi-objective optimization method, inspired by the ε-constraint method and the goal programming method, is developed to address the problem. The computational experiments are conducted for the Europe Pakistan India Consortium 2 (EPIC-2) shipping route. The results show that the developed solution method is able to generate the Pareto Fronts with sufficient solution density. The experiments also demonstrate that the proposed multi-objective mathematical model could facilitate the analysis of trade-offs amongst the economic and environmental perspectives in the ship schedule design. Furthermore, the importance of effective collaborative agreements amongst shipping lines and marine terminal operators is showcased as well. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative agreements; Environmental sustainability; Liner shipping; Maritime transportation; Multi-objective optimization; Ship scheduling","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Linear programming; Ships; Sustainable development; Waterway transportation; Collaborative agreement; Environmental sustainability; Liner shipping; Maritime transportation; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Ship scheduling; Shipping Lines; Shipping routes; Terminal operators; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125195018

MPITU has advanced agricultural structures and has considerably revolutionized agricultural activities to enhance smart agriculture. The main objective of this research was to effectively evaluate the impact of MPITU on the selection of sales productivity and marketing channels and examine if MPITU helps increase the incomes of growers. It is crucial to understand whether MPITU can ultimately increase the incomes of rural farmers. This study used data set of 580 wheat growers from four districts in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK) of Pakistan. We used propensity score matching (PSM), ordinary least squares (OLS), and Heckman's two-step regression (HTSR) techniques to achieve the research goals. The larger the MPITU, the more substantial and positive the impact on agricultural income. After applying the PSM and Heckman regression methods, it was found that MPITU significantly improved the efficiency of selecting sales channels. Its impact on agricultural profits was also leading (about 41%), with support and non-agricultural profits exceeding 31%. Finally, the results showed a significant impact of the choice of favorable auction and marketing channels on the rural farmer's income. It is recommended that government and non-governmental organizations improve the rural and agricultural development policies. In addition, the authorities should expand MPITU training services for farmers, including wheat growers, which may help improve growers' ability to increase agricultural productivity and household income. © 2022","Agricultural modernization; Heckman's two-step regression; Internet technology; Mobile phone; Profits; Propensity score matching; Sales channels","Agriculture; Commerce; Modernization; Productivity; Regression analysis; Sales; Agricultural modernizations; Heckman two-step regression; Internet technology; Mobile Internet technology; Mobile phone technology; Pakistan; Propensity score matching; Sales channels; Step regression; Technology usages; Profitability; agricultural technology; agricultural worker; income; Internet; mobile phone; modernization; profitability; regression analysis; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122291891

It has a detrimental impact on neighborhood safety and reputation. Blight also creates low-value areas in urban centers, reduces property values and business investment, and increases unemployment. These effects make urban blight an issue of growing interest as the need to eradicate blighted properties has significantly increased worldwide. This study adopted a constructivist, socio-technical stance that combined cognitive mapping, moving averages, and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. This methodological approach facilitated the identification of prevention strategies that control urban blight occurrences and subsequent eradication subject to seasonal constraints. Based on real-world cases, data was collected directly from a panel of urban blight experts. The members analyzed different prevention initiatives in terms of five major dimensions—governance, community involvement, economic context, territorial planning, and operations—which were previously identified during the development of a collective causal map.

Our drivers of Industry 4.0 include big data, smart factory, cyber physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of things (IoT). However, there is dearth of research showcasing the effects of these drivers on the service sector in various countries. For this reason, we consider the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework, as shaped by the institutional theory, within the context of this research. This research adopts a cross-sectional quantitative approach to identify the variation in sub-groups that refer to the samples in Bangladesh and Canada. Through purposive sampling, networking, and connections, a total of 210 (105 each) survey questionnaires, as completed by employees working in logistics companies, were gathered. Smart partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the collected data, which revealed that Industry 4.0 has a significant role in promoting and improving the performance of the services industry of both economies. However, the impact of all drivers is more highly statistically significant for Canada than for Bangladesh. Thus, this research demonstrates the role of Industry 4.0 in terms of improving the performance of the logistics industries in contrasting economies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","comparative study; Industry 4.0; service industry; smart factory","Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Service industry; Surveys; Comparative studies; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Developing regions; Institutional theory; Internet of thing (IOT); Partial least square (PLS); Quantitative approach; Structural equation modelling; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092788361

Despite such a vital role, the extant literature lacks from the extensive analysis of Industry 4.0 implementations in the logistics industry, particularly for LSPs. Accordingly, this study sets out to investigate, comprehensively, Industry 4.0 projections in logistics and their reflections on LSPs by adopting a multidimensional approach. In this respect, the key themes influenced by Industry 4.0 developments are initially determined through a structured survey conducted in the Turkish logistics industry. Then, in the same industry, both the probabilities and the impacts of Industry 4.0-focused thematic statements are examined through an integrative interview survey, which also incorporates ‘why-type’ of questions. Consequently, this study offers academic implications in terms of demonstrating possible changes in the logistics industry from the operational, financial, and human resources aspects.

With the value offered by BA, companies are able to discover the hidden information in the data, improve decision-making processes, and support strategic planning. On the other hand, because there are multiple criteria and multiple alternatives involved in most decision-making situations, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods play an important role in BA practices. Providing inputs to the components of descriptive or predictive analytics or being used as a decision-making tool for evaluating the alternatives within prescriptive analytics exemplify the roles. Therefore, the use of hidden information discovered by business analytics and the need for utilizing the right MCDM method for optimal decision-making made these two concepts inseparable. In this paper, in order to review the use of MCDM methods in BA, the subject of BA is investigated from a taxonomical perspective (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive), and its connection with MCDM techniques is revealed. Similarly, MCDM methods are studied using two main categories, multi-attribute decision making (MADM) and multi-objective decision making (MODM) methods. Furthermore, tabular and graphical analyses are also performed within the proposed review methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first attempt that holistically considers the use of MCDM methods in BA. © 2021","Business analytics; Decision support; Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM); Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); Multi-objective decision-making (MODM)","Decision making; Predictive analytics; Business analytics; Decision supports; Multi attribute decision making; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi objective decision making; Multi-attribute decision-making; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Decision support systems; business development; decision making; decision support system; holistic approach; investment; multicriteria analysis; planning method; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115179354

It is implemented in the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Methods Selection Software (MCDA-MSS), a decision support system that helps analysts answer a recurring question in decision science: “Which is the most suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis method (or a subset of MCDA methods) that should be used for a given Decision-Making Problem (DMP)?”. The MCDA-MSS provides guidance to lead decision-making processes and choose among an extensive collection (>200) of MCDA methods. These are assessed according to an original comprehensive set of problem characteristics. The accounted features concern problem formulation, preference elicitation and types of preference information, desired features of a preference model, and construction of the decision recommendation. The applicability of the MCDA-MSS has been tested on several case studies. The MCDA-MSS includes the capabilities of (i) covering from very simple to very complex DMPs, (ii) offering recommendations for DMPs that do not match any method from the collection, (iii) helping analysts prioritize efforts for reducing gaps in the description of the DMPs, and (iv) unveiling methodological mistakes that occur in the selection of the methods. A community-wide initiative involving experts in MCDA methodology, analysts using these methods, and decision-makers receiving decision recommendations will contribute to the expansion of the MCDA-MSS. © 2022 The Author(s)","Decision analysis; Decision support system; Method recommendation; Multiple criteria; Taxonomy","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Operations research; Satellites; Taxonomies; Analysis method; Decision-making problem; Decision-making process; Method recommendation; Multiple criteria; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Preference elicitation; Preference information; Problem formulation; Provide guidances; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123992000

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike. © 2022 The Authors","Augmented reality; Avatars; Extended reality; Metaverse; Second life; Virtual reality; Virtual world","Economic and social effects; Economics; Interactive computer graphics; Leisure; Virtual reality; Augmented reality technology; Avatar; Extended reality; Immersive; Metaverses; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Physical world; Second Life; Social interactions; Virtual worlds; Augmented reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134587952

This paper uses a MODWT-Vine quantile regression method to study the dynamic dependence and risk contagion effects among the international oil market, the Chinese commodity market and the Chinese stock market under multiple time scales, thus bringing in more specific information by considering the influence of covariates. The empirical results show that for the original time scale, the positive correlation between oil and stock decreases with the impact of the Chinese commodity market. The spread of the risk from the international oil market to the Chinese commodity market is relatively stronger than that to the Chinese stock market when the influence of covariates is controlled. The Chinese commodity market shares the risk contagion of the international oil market to the Chinese stock market to a certain degree. Volatility spillovers within the Chinese market are stronger than oil market spillovers to the Chinese domestic market. Besides, the risk contagion is different on different investment levels, for instance, the risk in the Chinese stock market of the medium-term investment time scale of 2–32 days is more contagious than that of the short-term time scale of 1–2 days. Finally, the asymmetry of risk contagion across the discussed markets of oil, stock and commodity reveals the specific and important information about the sensitivity of the risk contagion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric effects; Chinese commodity market; Chinese stock market; International oil market; Investment time scale; MODWT-Vine quantile regression; Risk contagion","Commerce; Financial markets; Regression analysis; Time measurement; Asymmetric effects; Chinese commodity market; Chinese stock market; Commodities market; International oil markets; Investment time scale; MODWT-vine quantile regression; Quantile regression; Risk contagion; Time-scales; Investments; commodity market; energy efficiency; energy market; oil trade; regression analysis; stock market; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126554773

Customers make delivery requests over the course of the day, and the dispatcher dynamically dispatches vehicles and drones to deliver the goods to customers before their delivery deadline. Vehicles can deliver multiple packages in one route but travel relatively slowly due to the urban traffic. Drones travel faster, but they have limited capacity and require charging or battery swaps. To exploit the different strengths of the fleets, we propose a deep Q-learning approach. Our method learns the value of assigning a new customer to either drones or vehicles as well as the option to not offer service at all. In a systematic computational analysis, we show the superiority of our policy compared to benchmark policies and the effectiveness of our deep Q-learning approach. We also show that the combination of state and action features is very valuable and that our policy can maintain effectiveness when demand data and the fleet size change moderately. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic vehicle routing; Reinforcement learning; Same-day delivery; Transportation","Deep learning; Drones; Reinforcement learning; Sales; Delivery deadlines; Dispatch vehicles; Dynamic Vehicle Routing; Learn+; Limited capacity; Q-learning; Q-learning approach; Reinforcement learnings; Same-day delivery; Urban traffic; Vehicle routing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109442088

This model provides a significant advantage when one has insufficient data for any one customer and wishes to generalize learning about one customer’s preferences to the population. Under this model, we study the statistical learning task of model fitting from a static store of precollected customer data. This setting, in contrast to the popular learning and earning paradigm, represents the situation many business teams encounter in which their data collection abilities have outstripped their data analysis capabilities. In this learning setting, we establish finite-sample convergence guarantees on the model parameters. The parameter convergence guarantees are then extended to out-of-sample performance guarantees in terms of revenue, in the form of a high-probability bound on the gap between the expected revenue of the best action taken under the estimated parameters and the revenue generated by a decision maker with full knowledge of the choice model. We further discuss practical implications of these bounds. We demonstrate the personalization approach using ticket purchase data from an airline carrier.

To address challenges caused by the pandemic, it is critical for the construction industry to develop a clear understanding of how the pandemic has affected the industry and how it will change in the future. However, assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry is challenging due to the broad influence of the pandemic and the dynamic nature of the industry. The Purdue Index for Construction (Pi-C), which was developed as an indicator based on five dimensions and corresponding metrics to measure the health status of the construction industry, offers an opportunity to understand the impact of the pandemic. In this context, this paper presents a study to reveal the relationship between COVID-19 and the health status of the industry as measured through Pi-C and predict the future trend of the construction industry. This study achieves the objective via the three steps. First, the relationship between the pandemic and Pi-C metrics is identified using the Granger causality test and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Second, multivariable prediction models are developed based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - a deep learning algorithm - to predict Pi-C metrics in the future. Third, forecasted Pi-C metrics are integrated into the existing Pi-C structure to analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and predict its trends in 2021-2022. The results revealed that the impacts of the pandemic were conspicuous in two Pi-C dimensions (economy and stability), whereas no significant impacts were observed in the remaining Pi-C dimension (social). In addition, the Pi-C forecasted that there would be no significant adverse impacts on the US construction industry caused by the pandemic until the end of 2022. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Data analytics; Granger causality test; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Multivariable prediction; Purdue index for construction (Pi-C); Structural equation modeling (SEM)","Brain; Construction industry; Data Analytics; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Statistical tests; Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Data analytics; Granger causality test; Long short-term memory; Multi variables; Multivariable prediction; Purdue index for construction; Structural equation modeling; Structural equation models; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116869461

To unlock the digitalization of sustainable production systems, manufacturing organizations are keen to adopt digital technologies to enhance performance. This paper analyses the social acceptability dimensions of I4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing (DM) and proposes a novel framework. The dimensions were identified through an extensive literature review. A data set of 121 responses was collected from different Indian manufacturing units and exploratory factor analysis was employed with dimensions structured into seven categories - safety, psychological, behavioural, compliance, cultural, employee and market. To develop inter-relationships amongst the main dimensions, a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique was utilized. Based on the priority order, 'security breaches' is the most significant dimension, followed by 'data theft'. The study contributes to both the theory of socio-technical transition (TSTT) and social cognition theory (SCT) by describing the impact of I4.0 technologies on social and personal behaviour.

One of the traditional tools for the prediction of pipeline failure is the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) technique due to its ease of application. However, many limitations have been identified in its application especially for cross-country pipelines in developing countries. Firstly, failure data is often either unavailable or unreliable, therefore identification of the risk priority numbers for the three failure factors (i.e. probability of failure, severity and detection) relies on experts' elicitation. Secondly, domain experts often provide diverse opinions and knowledge, which could produce different assessment rankings and it is often difficult to harmonise due to the multidisciplinary nature of the FMEA team. Thirdly, there is a lack of a systematic way of accounting for the relative importance of individual failure factors, which carries the risk of the assessment results not representing the true risk picture of the assessed system. Consequently, this paper proposes a new approach, called the modified FMEA, by integrating the noted benefits of hybrid FMEA with Fuzzy Rule Base (FRB) and FMEA with Grey Relations Theory (GRT) in order to overcome the identified drawbacks. The study utilises both the fuzzy and the grey theory to include experts' diverse opinions and to assign a relative weighting to each assessment factor in the risk assessment. The results of the risk assessment are then used to determine the risk priority and rank the failure modes under different types of conditions. A case study of Nigeria's petroleum product pipeline system 2 B is conducted to examine the applicability and validity of the new approach. The results show the practical application of the methodology in this new domain. The new approach offers a more effective method for identifying product pipeline system hazards and risk analysis in geographies with limited or unreliable data. The application of this new methodology in the oil and gas cross-country pipeline domain will aid decision making under uncertainty for pipeline inspection and maintenance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","FMEA; Fuzzy rule base; Grey relations; Hazard identification; Petroleum pipeline; Risk assessment","Accident prevention; Decision making; Developing countries; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Gasoline; Hazards; Petroleum industry; Pipelines; Risk analysis; Safety factor; Cross country pipelines; Failure factors; Failure mode and effects analysis; Fuzzy rule base; Gray-relation; Hazard identification; New approaches; Pipe-line systems; Products pipeline; Risks assessments; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114191905

Using Nigeria as a case study, the research developed strategies for improving the regulation of construction H&S in a complex regulatory environment. Semi-structured interviews, analysled thematically, was adopted. The proposed H&S improvement strategies include contextualised construction H&S legislation that will enable the establishment of a homogenous but flexible regulatory system. This will be overseen by an independent National Construction H&S regulator but with the controlled support of selected industry and social actors. The regulatory process will include persuasion (such as negotiation), punitive measures, education and awareness strategies. The proposed strategies also include that H&S legislation should stipulate duties for clients, contractors and subcontractors including goal-based legislation with mainly absolute duties, and prescriptive legislation or guidance. This should not be misconstrued as oversimplifying complex phenomena.

The analysis considers 23 developing and developed countries and covers the period from January 1981 to December 2017. The causal relationship between TA and EG is determined using a bootstrap mixed-frequency Granger causality approach adopting a rolling window technique to evaluate its stability and persistency over time. Empirical results show that causality is time-varying in both the short-term and the long-term. We illustrate our results by constructing a new global connectivity index (GCI). The GCI shows that international TA remain a leading indicator for future EG in a global perspective, especially during the global financial crisis (GFC). Our findings suggest that tourism sector plays an important part in the future EG in developing countries after the GFC. Similarly, the period after the GFC is characterised by one of the highest values of the tourism-led EG in developed countries according to the GCI; however, this effect is temporal and quickly eradicates. Overall, we find that tourism sector in developing countries remains a primary contributor to future EG, which is not the case in developed countries. © The Author(s) 2021.","bootstrap granger causality; economic growth; global tourism; mixed data sampling (MIDAS); rolling window","developing world; economic activity; economic growth; frequency analysis; Granger causality test; numerical model; sampling; temporal analysis; tourism economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101040898

Moreover, the innovation of financial technology (FinTech) has further contributed to the adoption of supply chain finance (SCF) by delivering financial services using information technologies (IT) and simplifying SMEs’ loan and transaction processes. Therefore, Industry 4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, and analytics have a critical role to play in the development and impact of FinTech.

Small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) are key participants in several supply chains, but their operations often produce a significant environmental impact. Their transition to sustainable practices is challenging because they operate with constrained resources, which are mostly invested in pressing activities. Therefore, evidence is needed that shows the benefits of investing limited resources in sustainable activities to support decision-making in SMEs. Research has neglected to connect circular economy and sustainable-oriented innovation whilst accounting for external factors affecting the implementation of sustainable processes and technology within SMEs in developing countries. This paper fills that gap by analyzing the impact of external factors on the implementation of circular economy and technology, and their influence on sustainable-oriented innovation and sustainable performance. Responses from 165 Mexican SMEs have been collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling to test direct and indirect effects between constructs. Findings reveal that while both governmental support and customer pressure facilitate the adoption of circular economy, only governmental support contributes directly to technology implementation. They also highlight the value of circular economy to support the adoption of sustainable-oriented innovation and to mediate the relationship between technology implementation and sustainable-oriented innovation. The overarching finding is that circular economy promoting sustainability-oriented innovation has a positive impact on financial, environmental, and social performance. This is a key implication to inform managers in SMEs on the potential benefits of investing in sustainable solutions. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Small and medium sized enterprises; Structural equation modelling; Sustainability-oriented innovation","Decision making; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Supply chains; Circular economy; Economic and environmental performance; External factors; Small and medium-size enterprise; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Social performance; Social-economic; Structural equation models; Sustainability-oriented innovation; Technology implementation; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127164700

The transaction-level data set includes nearly 50 million transactions (purchase and return) across both online and brick-and-mortar channels. Although the strategy of buying online and picking up in a store is primarily designed to attract online shoppers into stores, our findings show that after the competitor’s launch, both online and store sales at the focal department store chain are negatively affected. Our results indicate a differential competitive threat that is predicated on the value proposition that the buy-online-and-pickup-in-store service poses for customers in each channel. Online shoppers are drawn to the competitor through an additional level of shopping assurance, along with the free and fast delivery that the buy-online-and-pick-up-in-store service provides to customers. For store shoppers, the service facilitates research-online, buy-offline behavior, as well as product availability information that eliminates wasted trips to the store. Distance to market affects the intensity of impact. For the online channel, the estimated loss in sales averages 4.7% across the demographic market areas that are served and ranges between 0.4% and 18.5%.

However, the majority of studies have focused on the individual rather than the organizational level. There is also a relative paucity of research on organizational level factors that affect the use of social media applications by non-profit organizations (NPOs). Hence, this study aims to bridge this gap in research by analyzing the factors that determine social media use, which leads to increasing the effectiveness (i.e., awareness, community engagement, and fundraising) of NPOs. The data were collected through questionnaires distributed to public relations practitioners in 325 NPOs in Jordan and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results supported the vital role of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, and management commitment on the actual usage of social media. The results also showed that using social media has a significant positive effect on awareness and community engagement, while no significant impact is reported regarding fundraising. Theoretically, this study extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) by incorporating new factors, namely management commitment, awareness, community engagement, and fundraising, and proposing new relationships in the model.

A two-stage PLS-SEM-artificial-neural-network (ANN) predictive analytic approach was adopted to analyze the collected data, of which PLS-SEM was first applied to test the hypotheses, followed by the ANN technique to detect the nonlinear effect on the model. A total of 475 usable self-administered questionnaires were collected, and the results showed that only the relationship between the image and perceived usefulness (PU) was not supported. As per Model B, the ranking of subjective norms (SN) and PU between the PLS-SEM and ANN model does not match each other, implying that hidden attributes may exist in affecting the role of SN and PU under the practical context of which the relationship between variables may not fully be explained by a linear perspective. The finding is beneficial for advertising practitioners and software developers who wish to optimize BTA results. Theoretically, the study extends TAM2 in the context of advertising, which is a neglected research area. Methodologically, the study is the first to apply TAM2 using the hybrid PLS-SEM-ANN in the context of advertising. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial neural network; Behavioral targeting advertising; Mobile advertising; Mobile commerce; TAM; TAM2","Deep learning; Marketing; Neural networks; Surveys; Advertizing; Behavioral targeting advertizing; Behavioural targeting; Dual stage; Mobile advertizing; Perceived usefulness; Subjective norm; TAM; Technology acceptance model; Technology acceptance model 2; Mobile commerce; advertising; analytical framework; artificial neural network; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119050983

This work describes four studies, including a systematic literature review, with an overall sample of 141 participants in the survey (experts and novices), focus group sessions and testing of chatbots to (i) define attributes to assess the quality of interaction with chatbots and (ii) the designing and piloting a new scale to measure satisfaction after the experience with chatbots. Two instruments were developed: (i) A diagnostic tool in the form of a checklist (BOT-Check). This tool is a development of previous works which can be used reliably to check the quality of a chatbots experience in line with commonplace principles. (ii) A 15-item questionnaire (BOT Usability Scale, BUS-15) with estimated reliability between.76 and.87 distributed in five factors. BUS-15 strongly correlates with UMUX-LITE by enabling designers to consider a broader range of aspects usually not considered in satisfaction tools for non-conversational agents, e.g. conversational efficiency and accessibility, quality of the chatbot’s functionality and so on. Despite the convincing psychometric properties, BUS-15 requires further testing and validation. Designers can use it as a tool to assess products, thus building independent databases for future evaluation of its reliability, validity and sensitivity. © 2021, The Author(s).","AI; Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Chatbots; Conversational agents; Design; Evaluation; Human-Computer interaction (HCI); Interaction satisfaction; Satisfaction; Trust; Usability; User experience","Buses; Surveys; Chatbot; Chatbots; Conversational agents; Diagnostic tools; Focus groups; Psychometric properties; Quality of interaction; Systematic literature review; User experience",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110968998

This study tests consumer involvement as the mediator in the relationship between consumer intention to participate in online group buying and their decision-making styles. The results show that involvement significantly mediates the relationships between the recreational, hedonistic; price-conscious; habitual, brand loyal; and the confused by over-choice consumer decision-making styles and their intention to participate. Interestingly, the novelty-fashion conscious decision-making style shows a significant direct effect but no mediation through involvement. The study makes substantive contributions toward the online consumer behavior literature and website management.

Among others, we found that board characteristics play a significant role particularly in new profit efficiency; therefore, policymakers and regulators should consider Board Size, Board Independence, Board Meetings, and Duality while framing guidelines for enhancing bank new profit efficiency. We also found that Board Independence plays a vital role in bank new cost efficiency, while Gender Diversity contributes to both new technical and new cost efficiency.

As a corollary to this notion, in the subject study, we developed a three-regime threshold autoregressive distributed lags (TARDL) model, which allows us to accommodate the asymmetric effect of financial development on economic growth in top 10 financially developed countries. We augmented the TARDL model by including trade openness, capital formation and labour as potential determinants of economic growth. The empirical findings revealed the existence of threshold asymmetric co-integration between variables. In particular, in the upper regime, financial development boosts economic growth in Singapore while it exerts a negative impact on economic growth in Finland. In the middle regime, financial development increases economic growth in Australia and Singapore. However, in the lower regime, financial development hampers economic growth in the US, Malaysia and Singapore. Trade openness has a positive long-run influence on economic growth in Canada, South Africa, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Finland and Norway. Capital formation strengthens economic growth in the US and Malaysia in the long-run. Labour is found to sustain economic growth in the long-run for Malaysia and Singapore. The dynamic multipliers which depict the response path of economic growth to a one-unit shock of financial development in the three regimes highlight the discrepancies in the reaction of economic growth to financial development shocks occurring in different regimes. Important policy implications can be instigated from the empirical results. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"capital; economic growth; labor; trade openness; Australia; Finland; Malaysia; New Zealand; Norway; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090058659

Predictions of mortality, cases and hospitalisations help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we combine the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. We use a dataset that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. A notable feature of the dataset is that the availability of forecasts from participating teams varies greatly across the 40 weeks in our study. We evaluate the accuracy of combining methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods. In addition, we propose several new weighted combining methods. Our results show that, although the median was very useful for the early weeks of the pandemic, the simple average was preferable thereafter, and that, as a history of forecast accuracy accumulates, the best results can be produced by a weighted combining method that uses weights that are inversely proportional to the historical accuracy of the individual forecasting teams. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Distributional forecasts; Forecast combining; Interval forecasts; OR in health services","Decision making; Probability distributions; Combining method; COVID-19; Distributional forecast; Forecast combining; Forecasting modeling; Interval forecasts; OR in health services; Probabilistic forecasts; Probability: distributions; Simple++; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110475715

The empirical analysis integrates the panel unit root tests (IPS and CIPS), panel quantile regression, and fully modified OLS models. The empirical results confirm that there exists a significant negative relationship between renewable energy and export diversification; signifying that diversification of products will reduce renewable energy. Similarly, when compared to the square of export product diversification, it shows a positive and significant correlation. The empirical findings highlighted the presence of Kuznets's hypothesis between export product diversification, renewable, and non-renewable energy consumption. Furthermore, the findings suggest that natural resources and economic growth may increase overall energy consumption in GCC countries.

Our findings show that the major economies (including G20) realize positive economic growth with increasing long-run energy diversification. However, some countries (e.g., OECD and G20) experience negative economic growth due to energy diversification in the short term. The results also disclose that energy diversification does not favor economic growth in low-income economies, both short and long terms.

The RDEA models proposed in the literature apply robust optimization techniques to the linear and conventional DEA models which lead to the difficulty of obtaining a robust efficient DMU. To overcome this difficulty, this paper tackles uncertainty in DMUs from the original fractional DEA model. We propose a robust fractional DEA (RFDEA) model in both input and output orientation which enables us to overcome the deficiency of existing RDEA models. The linearized models of the fractional DEA are further used to establish duality relations from a pessimistic and optimistic view of the data. We show that the primal worst of the multiplier model is equivalent to the dual best of the envelopment model. Furthermore, we show that the robust efficiency in the input- and output-oriented DEA models are still equivalent in the new approach which is not the case in conventional RDEA models. We finally present a study of the largest airports in Europe to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed models. The proposed RDEA is found to provide an effective management evaluation strategy under uncertain environments. © 2021","Data envelopment analysis; Duality in Robust DEA; European airports; Robust DEA; Uncertainty in efficiency measurement","airport; article; decision making; discrete element analysis; drug efficacy; Europe; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121922932

Design/methodology/approach: The construction industry needs innovative technologies due to its complex and dynamic nature. In this respect, the latest trends such as digitalization, building information modeling (BIM), Internet of things (IoT) are of utmost importance in terms of fostering the change in managing projects and encouraging industry practitioners to adopt the change for better performance. This paper focuses on I4.0adoption among construction companies. In this respect, a questionnaire was designed and administered to construction professionals to reveal the challenges in I4.0 adoption among construction firms. The respondents were requested to fill in the questionnaire on the I4.0 efforts of their companies. The questionnaire was intended to collect the perceptions of industry practitioners working at large construction companies. Based on these, the challenges listed were ranked based on their relative importance and success indices. Finally, the Mann–Whitney U test was conducted to test whether statistically significant responses exist among groups of respondents (i.e. young and old companies, large and small, high and low revenue and main area of expertise). Findings: The results of the study indicated that resistance to change, unclear benefits and gains and cost of implementation are the major important challenges in terms of I4.0 adoption in construction projects. On the other hand, the data analysis implied that the majority of construction organizations successfully deal with the problems arising from lack of standardization, legal and contractual issues and cost of implementing in terms of promoting I4.0 adoption. Research limitations/implications: The study is expected to guide construction practitioners in terms of benefitting from I4.0 applications and deliver projects with better outcomes. This study might be used as a guide for the companies aiming to start their I4.0 transformation knowing the challenges and develop strategies for how to handle them. A concrete plan would help them achieve greater performance and benefit from the I4.0 implementation at the maximum level. Finally, the study implies that construction firms shall prepare action plans for handling each challenge listed and monitor their performance based on the planned and actual data of their projects. Originality/value: This study investigates the major challenges of I4.0 among construction companies. This is one of the important studies, which puts I4.0 focus forefront of the construction industry with a clear identification of challenges that construction organizations have to address to transform their organizations into construction 4.0. The study has the potential to guide both industry practitioners and researchers to develop awareness for the benefits of using the latest technology and fostering innovation. This is expected to create value for construction clients in terms of achieving the product with serious gains such as time and cost. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Challenges; Construction; Industry 4.0; Opportunities; Technology","Construction; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Surveys; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction companies; Construction organizations; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Design/methodology/approach; Innovative technology; Internet of Things (IOT); Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106258623

The rapidly increasing blockchain forks have resulted in fierce competition and created significant controversies in blockchain community. To analyze this competitive aspect, we consider blockchain as a two-sided platform that serves both customers and miners. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate how a blockchain platform's decision on its settings, such as block size and transaction fee, affects the competition between blockchain platforms as well as the participation behavior of customers and miners. Our findings suggest that increasing the transaction fee alleviates congestion on the platform when customers have a relatively balanced need between efficiency and safety. In contrast, it induces congestion when efficiency is valued over safety. In addition, under hard fork competition, the difference in blockchain platforms' block sizes directs the attention of miners towards different types of mining rewards. Moreover, it also affects the optimal types of customers the blockchain platforms should target. Furthermore, we find that the degree of congestion and the risk attitudes of participants play vital roles in differentiating different block-sized platforms' optimal transaction fees. We provide empirical evidence on the theoretical findings and practical implications for blockchain platform competition with respect to the behaviors of platform participants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Empirical analysis; Game theory; Platform competition","Blockchain; Efficiency; Miners; Safety engineering; Sales; Block sizes; Block-chain; Empirical analysis; Game-theoretic model; Platform competition; Platform stability; Risk attitude; Two-sided platforms; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108543180

This study uses the concept of the Product Space (PS) network and its main hypothesis of path-dependent economic growth to fill this research gap. The path-dependent economic growth hypothesis argues that countries can grow their economy by increasing the types of products they produce and export, and that these new products should be developed based on countries' existing productive capabilities such as skills, institutions, capital, and technologies. However, recent studies show that countries do not restrict themselves to their existing productive capabilities to develop new products, as they increase human capital endowment and heavily invest in Technological Innovation (TI) to develop new products. The goal of this study is to better understand the relationship between path-dependent economic growth and heavy investment driven growth in the context of green economic performance. We construct a model using Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to investigate the relation of TI and green product development, based on the path-dependent economic growth hypothesis, on Countries' Overall Green Growth Performance (COGGP). The constructed model uses TI and green product empirical data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 61 countries, including both OECD and non-OECD members, from 2003 to 2015. This study evaluates three hypotheses: the first hypothesis (H1) is confirmed, suggesting that TI has a positive and significant effect on COGGP; the second hypothesis (H2) is not confirmed, in that the results show that TI has a positive and significant impact on Path-Dependent Green Product Development (PDGPD), which is aligned with the concept of the PS network and its main hypothesis of path-dependent economic growth; the third hypothesis (H3) is confirmed, suggesting that PDGPD has a positive and significant effect on COGGP. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence to support the role of TI and the PS network and its hypothesis of path-dependent economic growth in advancing COGGP. Furthermore, the findings indicate that while TI is a crucial factor that fosters COGGP and PDGPD, it is not enough to enable countries to go beyond their existing productive capabilities to produce new green products; therefore, along with productive capabilities, TI is another factor that countries should consider while developing their policy agendas for producing new green products. Based on these findings, this study proposes some policy actions that can be considered by policy makers and researchers to promote green growth in countries around the world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Green growth; Green product development; Innovation; Path-dependent economic growth; Technological innovation","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Product development; Economic growths; Green growths; Green product development; Green products; Growth performance; Innovation; Path-dependent economic growth; Productive capabilities; Space network; Technological innovation; Least squares approximations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123235557

We primarily contribute to the DEA literature in four ways. First, we decompose banks’ overall inefficiency performance indicator into five component indicators, namely, the sub-indicators of innovation, two kinds of stability, profitability and corporate social responsibility. Second, since the proposed model, which is an absolute value optimization problem, does not give the overall inefficiency score directly, we introduce a two-step procedure to obtain all sub-indicator scores and the overall inefficiency score. Third, we extend the by-production framework by proposing not only a concept and interpretation of “strategic disposability” for an intermediate undesirable output in estimating the stability sub-indicators, but also another concept of “strategic disposability” for an intermediate undesirable input in gauging the sub-indicator related to corporate social responsibility. Our results show that 1) the Chinese banking industry has a high level of innovation inefficiency and profitability inefficiency is higher than primary business stability inefficiency, strategic management stability inefficiency and corporate social responsibility inefficiency for all the bank ownership types except the state-owned commercial banks; 2) state-owned commercial banks have a higher level of corporate social responsibility inefficiency compared to the other inefficiencies; 3) state-owned commercial banks, rural commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks are the best three performers with different ownership types performing well in different perspectives; 4) all different ownership types experience a level of performance volatility over the examined period. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Data envelopment analysis; Innovation; Strategic disposability; Undesirable inputs/outputs","Disposability; Profitability; Stability; 'current; Corporate social responsibility; Data envelopment; Innovation; Network data; Ownership type; Performances evaluation; State-owned commercial banks; Strategic disposability; Undesirable input/output; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106612917

In this study, we demonstrated that does it “pay to be good” in the supply chain. Specifically, we explored whether a firm's CSR activities impact value added in the supply chain. Building on theoretical foundations of the O-ring theory of economic development, we developed a production function describing processes subject to mistakes made by any of several suppliers in production networks and the potential impact CSR could have on value-added creation. Our results provide evidence for a positive significant relationship between value-added in the supply chain and the disclosure of CSR reports, implying that the net effect of CSR disclosure is, on average, value-added enhancing rather than value-added destroying for the supply chain in our sample. Notably, we verified that these results are not only driven by increases in CSR disclosure and related improvements in firm performance but also create spillover effects in the supply chain. Thus, by integrating CSR into their bottom line, companies can practice sustainability initiatives and add value throughout their supply chain. © 2021","Corporate social responsibility; Firm performance; Mechanism; Model; Supply chain; Value added","Economic and social effects; Chain-mechanism; Corporate social responsibility; Firm Performance; Impact value; O-Rings; Performance effect; Social values; Supply chain modeling; Theoretical foundations; Value added; Supply chains; corporate social responsibility; industrial performance; model; spillover effect; supply chain management; sustainability; valuation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117778238

While statisticians argue for the use of measures with good statistical properties, practitioners prefer measures that are easy to communicate and understand. Moreover, researchers argue that the loss-function for parameterizing a model should be aligned with how the post-performance measurement is made. In this paper we ask: Does it matter? Will the relative ranking of the forecasting methods change significantly if we choose one measure over another? Will a mismatch of the in-sample loss-function and the out-of-sample performance measure decrease the performance of the forecasting models?

However, little is known about how such facilities are financed. This issue creates potential knowledge gaps, one of which this study aims to address. This study examines the key drivers for green building project financing in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an explanatory sequential design with an initial quantitative instrument phase, followed by a qualitative data collection phase. An extensive critical comparative review of the literature resulted in the identification of eight potential drivers. One hundred and twenty-seven questionnaire responses based upon these drivers from the Ghanaian construction industry were received. Data were coded with SPSS v22, analysed descriptively (mean, standard deviation and standard error) and via inferential analysis (One Way ANOVA and One-Sample t-Test). These data were then validated through semi-structured interviews with ten industry professionals within the Ghana Green Building Council. Data obtained from the semi-structured validation interviews were analysed through the side-by-side comparison of the qualitative data with the quantitative data. Findings: Though all eight drivers are important, the five key drivers for the Ghanian construction industry were identified as, in order of importance, “high return on investment”, “emerging business opportunity”, “ethical investment”, “conservation of resources” and “mandatory regulations, standards, and policies”. The interviewees agreed to and confirmed the importance of these identified drivers for green building project financing from validating the survey's key findings. Research limitations/implications: Key limitations of this study are the restrictions regarding the geographical location of the collected data (i.e. Kumasi and Accra); timing of the study and sample size (i.e. the COVID-19 pandemic making it difficult to obtain adequate data). Practical implications: Though this study was conducted in Ghana, its implications could be useful to researchers, policymakers, stakeholders and practitioners in wider sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, financial institutions can invest in green buildings to expand their green construction and mortgage finance products to build higher value and lower risk portfolios. The findings from this study can provide investors with the enhanced certainty needed to help guide and inform their investment decisions, i.e. what to invest in, and when, by how much and how a scheme being “green” may influence their rate of return. Also, for building developers, it will give them a clearer understanding of the business case for green buildings and how to differentiate themselves in the market to grow their businesses. Originality/value: This study's findings provide insights into an under-investigated topic in Ghana and offer new and additional information and insights to the current state-of-the-art on the factors that drive green building project financing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Drivers; Ghana; Green buildings; Green project financing; Sustainability; Sustainable or green construction","Buildings; Conservation; Construction; Construction industry; Digital storage; Earnings; Environmental technology; Green manufacturing; Project management; Surveys; Conservation of resources; Construction technologies; Design/methodology/approach; Geographical locations; Green Building Council; Green building projects; Industry professionals; Semi structured interviews; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108976543

Diversified financial indices and complex subjective preferences are important factors affecting investment decisions within the MCDM framework. Therefore, this study adopts a well-known behavioral MCDM model called generalized TODIM (TOmada de Decisão Iterativa Multicritério) for portfolio selection based on the financial performance of firms. First, a multidimensional financial evaluation index system is proposed for financial performance evaluation, which is the most appropriate approach for stock investment within a long-term horizon. Second, features are selected from the financial ratios using affinity propagation clustering (APC). Through the APC algorithm, financial ratios with a strong influence on stock evaluation can be obtained. Third, a generalized TODIM method with entropy weight is used to calculate the dominance relation between stocks and reflect investors’ bounded rational behaviors. Fourth, an extended mean–variance multi-objective portfolio selection model that considers financial and stock market performance is constructed. The compromise solution is used when solving the multi-objective optimization programming. Finally, a case study on medical stock investment in the Chinese stock market is examined to recommend the optimal portfolio allocation for investors. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are performed to demonstrate the robustness, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed methodology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Financial performance evaluation; Generalized TODIM; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Portfolio selection","Commerce; Decision making; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Financial performance; Financial performance evaluation; Generalized tomadum de decisao iterativa multicriterio; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Performances evaluation; Portfolio selection; Selection based; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130393883

Tourism development has been highlighted in the extant literature as a route to attaining sustainable economic growth. Past studies affirm that tourism contributes significantly to both the wealth of nations and cultural diffusion. However, whether institutional quality moderates the impact of tourism on economic growth has yet to be given sufficient academic attention. The study uses data from 2002 to 2017 and the generalised method of moments methodology, while the Dumitrescu–Hurlin panel causality test is applied to check the robustness of results. The empirical results show that a 1% increase in tourist arrivals or air transport led to a 0.41% and 0.17% increase in economic growth, respectively. However, when particular governance variables are taken into consideration, this impact is reduced to −0.09% and −0.02% for both tourism proxies. This implies that the influence of governance on the tourism-led growth hypothesis through an interaction term between institutional quality and tourist arrivals was found to reverse the impact of tourism on growth from positive to negative in both high-earning and tourism-dependent countries. While infrastructure also contributes to economic growth, its impact is slightly higher in top earners than in tourism-dependent economies. The results of the study suggest that weak institutions in both country groups allow corrupt practices, which divert the positive impact that tourism should have on economic growth. © The Author(s) 2021.","Arellano and Bond GMM; economic growth; governance; high earners; tourism; tourism dependence; tourism-led growth hypothesis","economic growth; sustainable development; tourism development; tourism economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100889069

Despite its hidden nature, interorganizational fraud can have major implications for supply chain performance. Based on the theories of transaction cost economics, agency theory, and the fraud triangle, widely used in accounting and auditing research, five potential antecedents of supply chain fraud are considered and compared with reported losses due to interorganizational fraud. The data collected via a survey questionnaire with a sample of 151 supply chain employees in manufacturing demonstrate that informants estimated median losses due to interorganizational fraud to be 9% of their firm's total revenue. The most common types of fraud reported include product quality fraud, pricing/invoicing fraud, and corruption. Using a two-step generalized method of moments technique for estimation, the results found that transactional complexity, competitive pressures facing the supply chain, and weak firm ties were significantly related to interorganizational fraud, and that supply chain monitoring and ethical sourcing were not significantly related to interorganizational fraud.

The study's goal is to look at the intricate of Industry 4.0's impediments to the advancement of digital manufacturing for long-term sustainability. Adoption of Industry 4.0 is challenging in the current environment, but the consideration of Industry 4.0 in the sustainability industry is much more difficult. The empirical investigation followed a mixed-methods approach, which included the systematic literature review (SLR) method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The thirty sustainability impediments relating to technological, organizational, economic, environmental, social, and institutional factors were identified using the SLR approach, and the AHP method (a multi-criteria decision-making method) was used to rank or prioritize the synchronized impediments. Based on the results from all six categories of impediments, the study found the organizational (compound priority weight 0.413) impediments of Industry 4.0 are the most prominent impediment to sustainability measures for digital manufacturing. It was followed by the Environmental, Technological, Economical, Societal and institutional impediments, with compound priority weights of 0.256, 0.152, 0.099, 0.054 and 0.026 respectively that represent the sequence of these impediments. Overall, the study reveals a 360-degree overview of the organization in order to identify Industry 4.0 factors for digital transformation. By examining the sustainability factors and challenges of Industry 4.0, the study assists company managers in revolutionizing their businesses into digitally-enabled ones.

Hospitals contracting with Medicare, for instance, are reimbursed for the procedures performed, regardless of the number of days that patients stay in the hospital. This reimbursement structure has incentivized hospitals to use their resources (such as their beds) more efficiently to maximize revenues. One way hospitals can improve bed utilization is by predicting patients’ length of stay (LOS) at the time of admission, the benefits of which extend to employees, communities, and the patients themselves. In this paper, we employ a data analytics approach to develop and test a deep learning neural network to predict LOS for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. The theoretical contribution of our effort is that it identifies variables related to patients’ prior admissions as important factors in the prediction of LOS in hospitals, thereby revising the current paradigm in which patients’ medical histories are rarely considered for the prediction of LOS. The methodological contributions of our work include the development of a data engineering methodology to augment the data sets, prediction of LOS as a numerical (rather than a binary) variable, temporal evaluation of the training and validation data sets, and a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting LOS for COPD and pneumonia inpatients. Our evaluations show that variables related to patients’ previous admissions are the main driver of the deep network's superior performance in predicting the LOS as a numerical variable. Using the assessment criteria introduced in prior studies (i.e., ±2 days and ±3 days tolerance), our models are able to predict the length of hospital stay with 86 % and 91 % accuracy for the COPD data set, and with 74 % and 85 % accuracy for the pneumonia data set. Hence, our effort could help hospitals serve a larger number of patients with a fixed amount of resources, thereby reducing their environmental footprint while increasing their revenue, as well as their patients’ satisfaction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data analytics; Deep learning; Length of hospital stay; Sustainability; Temporal evaluation","Data Analytics; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Forecasting; Health insurance; Personnel training; Pulmonary diseases; Sustainable development; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Environmental footprints; Learning neural networks; Length of hospital stays; Methodological contributions; Numerical variables; Sustainable operations; Temporal evaluation; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079834062

This paper sheds light on the role of Industry 4.0 technological capabilities in facilitating knowledge access from international linkages and improving firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on organizational learning research, the present study argues that the relationship between GVC breadth, analyzed in respect to the geographical fragmentation of production facilities and productivity follows an inverted U-shaped pattern that can be explained by the interplay between external knowledge access and the coordination costs associated with GVC breadth. We test our predictions using a purpose-built survey that was carried out among a sample of 426 Spanish manufacturing firms. Findings: Our results indicate that organizations adhering to a traditional manufacturing system are able to benefit from fewer transnational relationships (concretely 11 foreign facilities) in the search for productivity improvements. This can be largely attributed to the marginal value of the knowledge accessed and the costs of coordinating international counterparts' production and knowledge transfer. However, our study reveals that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies has the potential to broaden optimal GVC breadth, in terms of the number of linkages to interrelate with (concretely 131 foreign facilities) so as to obtain productivity gains while mitigating the complexities associated with coordination.

Exploring a real-life data set from a leading supermarket chain, we identify several distinctive challenges faced by such a retailer that have not been jointly studied in the literature: the retailer does not have perfect information on (1) the demand-price relationship, (2) the demand noise distribution, (3) the inventory perishability rate, and (4) how the demand-price relationship changes over time. Furthermore, the demand noise distribution is nonparametric for some products but parametric for others. To tackle these challenges, we design two types of data-driven pricing and ordering (DDPO) policies for the cases of nonparametric and parametric noise distributions. Measuring performance by regret, that is, the profit loss caused by not knowing (1)–(4), we prove that the T-period regret of our DDPO policies are in the order of T2=3(logT)1=2 and T1=2logT in the cases of nonparametric and parametric noise distributions, respectively. These are the best achievable growth rates of regret in these settings (up to logarithmic terms). Implementing our policies in the context of the aforementioned real-life data set, we show that our approach significantly outperforms the historical decisions made by the supermarket chain. Moreover, we characterize parameter regimes that quantify the relative significance of the changing environment and product perishability. Finally, we extend our model to allow for age-dependent perishability and demand censoring and modify our policies to address these issues.

Known literature on mobile commerce (MC) highlights its advantage on convenience, which now is accompanied by health safety. Although MC has been outgrowing other online sectors, the early stages of the pandemic provided a new scenario. We study the relationship between consumer's attitudes about Covid-19 public health restrictions and the behavioral intention for MC adoption. Previous research on technology acceptance of online and mobile shopping have focused on aspects like safety and behavioral intention as key factors. Thus, we examine how attitude towards social distancing practices during the pandemic has affected consumers intentions to adopt of mobile commerce. We aim to study the degree on which this attitude affects previous intentions on purchasing or subscribing to services via mobile devices. For this, we present a Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model of consumer MC adoption using social distance as a moderator. An empirical analysis using a survey of attitude and beliefs over mobile commerce and social distancing is presented, confirming the factors underlying using structural equation modeling. Results show that the attitudes toward social distancing are a significant moderator of purchasing through mobile devices; indicating that an individual's adherence to recommended practices during the pandemic does positively influence the adoption. MC is known for being a potential advantage to facilitate customer experience. According to our results, we believe marketers should reconsider or further develop MC infrastructure, highlighting its convenience and health safety role. © 2022","Consumer behavior; Covid-19; HCI; Mobile commerce; Technology adoption; Theory of planned behavior","Health; Mobile commerce; Sales; Behavioral intention; Consumer attitudes; Covid-19; Health safety; Key factors; Mobile shopping; Online shopping; Technology acceptance; Technology adoption; Theory of Planned Behavior; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124678099

While it shares a number of basic principles with various post-growth conceptualisations, the WE's language and concepts tend to be more adaptable to different social and economic contexts, thus penetrating into policy processes and connecting to a variety of cultural traits, not only in advanced economies but also in less industrialised nations. In this paper, we describe the key features of the WE, including its approach to key concepts like work, productivity and technology and several examples of its policy impact.

We illustrate the empirical relevance of this issue with microdata from Uganda and show similar findings for Peru, Tanzania, and Bangladesh. In addition, we show that the dispersion in both measures of productivity across farms of similar size is so large that it renders farm size an ineffective indicator for policy targeting.

However, extant methods such as supplier surveys rely on the willingness or ability of suppliers to share data and are not easily verifiable. In this article, we pose the supply chain visibility problem as a link prediction problem from the field of Machine Learning (ML) and propose the use of an automated method to detect potential links that are unknown to the buyer with Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Using a real automotive network as a test case, we show that our method performs better than existing algorithms.

More specifically, the input efficiency is estimated in the first stage, followed by the evaluation of stability efficiency in the second stage, and finally, the output efficiency is derived from the final stage. In particular, we consider market power in deposits and market power in loans in the banking production process. Rather than using non-performing loans as an undesirable output, this paper innovatively uses loan loss provisions in bank production. We argue that the loan loss provisions are helpful to improve bank stability because they provide a cushion to absorb unexpected losses, therefore we treat it as a good intermediate output in the second stage and a good intermediate input in the third stage. The results exhibit that the scores of stability inefficiency are the highest, followed by output inefficiency, while Chinese commercial banks have the lowest level of input inefficiency. Not only did we observe that the Chinese banking industry has the highest level of stability inefficiency, but we also noticed that the stability inefficiency had the strongest volatility during 2007–2017.

In such online purchases, trust and familiarity are considered two important driving forces of consumer decision making. While online sales advocate high levels of flexibility and choices for consumers, they also hold the online service provider responsible for ensuring the security of the online user's data. Using a structural equation model with data collected from the online service industry, we test the direct effects of 'social-media-induced purchase intention' on customer satisfaction. We also test the mediating role of e-commerce/online sales (e-advertisement, e-safety, and e-information) on customer satisfaction. In addition to social media advertising and information sharing, we find that a new factor - 'e-safety' - mediates the relationship between customer purchase intention and customer satisfaction. Our analysis indicates that online e-trust can be established between the customer and the service company when online purchases are made. At the same time, the quality of online information and e-safety of online payments make the service company trustworthy for future purchases. We relate data analysis directly to managerial decision making to avoid any delay in online customer services in the era of social media. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Customer satisfaction; e-safety; online trust; social media; structural equation modeling (SEM)","Decision making; Purchasing; Safety factor; Sales; Social networking (online); Customers' satisfaction; E trusts; E-safety; On-line service; Online sales; Online trust; Purchase intention; Social media; Structural equation modeling; Structural equation models; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132332444

We use daily data set from July 2011 to June 2021, and employ the extended joint connectedness approach of Balcilar et al. (2021), which has several advantages over traditional connectedness models. Our findings show that traditional determinants of US financial stress are dynamic and change in response to the monetary injections in late 2019 more as compared with the COVID-19. In spite of the importance of COVID-19, our analysis points towards the enhanced significance of US monetary injections in driving joint connectedness between financial stress and its prominent factors and strategic commodities.

We used the combination of structural equation modeling (SEM) and unsupervised machine learning approaches as an innovative method. The statistical population of the study concluded users who live in Hungary and use Facebook Marketplace. This research uses the convenience sampling approach to overcome bias. Out of 475 surveys distributed, a total of 466 respondents successfully filled out the entire survey with a response rate of 98.1%. The results showed that all dimensions of social network marketing, such as entertainment, customization, interaction, WoM and trend, had positively and significantly influenced consumer purchase behavior (CPB) in Facebook Marketplace. Furthermore, we used hierarchical clustering and K‐means unsupervised algorithms to cluster consumers. The results show that respondents of this research can be clustered in nine different groups based on behavior regarding demographic attributes. It means that distinctive strategies can be used for different clusters. Meanwhile, marketing managers can provide different options, products and services for each group. This study is of high importance in that it has adopted and used plspm and Matrixpls packages in R to show the model predictive power.

AI can be particularly beneficial in enhancing decision-making processes for complex and ill-structured problems that lack transparency and have unclear goals. Most AI algorithms require labeled datasets to learn the problem characteristics, draw decision boundaries, and generalize. However, most datasets collected to solve complex and ill-structured problems do not have labels. Additionally, most AI algorithms are opaque and not easily interpretable, making it hard for decision-makers to obtain model insights for developing effective solution strategies. To this end, we examine existing AI paradigms, mainly symbolic AI (SAI) guided by human domain knowledge and data-driven AI (DAI) guided by data. We propose an approach called informed AI (IAI) by integrating human domain knowledge into AI to develop effective and reliable data labeling and model explainability processes. We demonstrate and validate the use of IAI by applying it to a social media dataset comprised of conversations between customers and customer support agents to construct a solution – IAI defect explorer (I-AIDE). I-AIDE is utilized to identify product defects and extract the voice of customers to help managers make decisions to improve quality and enhance customer satisfaction. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Data labeling; Dynamic decision-making environments; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)","Data integration; Decision making; Defects; Domain Knowledge; Sales; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Customers' satisfaction; Data labelling; Domain knowledge; Dynamic decision making; Dynamic decision-making environment; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Human domain; Human knowledge; Ill-structured problems; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123685165

The model relates gold returns to changes of economic policy uncertainty, changes of geopolitical risk, market volatility due to interest rate variations and equity market volatility resulting from a worsening in the pandemic while controlling for the inflation rate, stock returns, economic growth, and changes in the exchange rate. Testing of gold prices expressed in U.S. dollars, British pounds, Euros, and Chinese yuans finds evidence that gold returns respond positively to a rise in a set of uncertainty variables, suggesting that gold can be viewed as a hedge against uncertainties. However, tests of a gold return equation in Indian rupee (or USD) show that some coefficients of uncertainty variables have negative signs because gold is most likely treated as an alternative to money. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic policy uncertainty; Geopolitical risk; Gold prices; Inflation; Real effective exchange rate","Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Gold; Investments; Planning; Wooden fences; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Exchange rates; Geopolitical risks; Gold prices; Inflation; Market volatility; Real effective exchange rate; Uncertainty; Uncertainty variables; Financial markets; currency; economic growth; economic policy; European Union; geopolitics; gold; inflation; price dynamics; real exchange rate; stock market; China; India; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123645139

Rural development policy discussions have presumed that access to broadband has become a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for economic growth and development. The relationship between broadband access on business startups, which are vital to local economic vibrancy, may be key to understanding the link between broadband and growth. In this study, we explore how qualitative features of broadband influence startup rates across different types of industries. To refine our insights into these relationships, we look at broadband by speed (both download and upload coverage across four speed categories). We also consider the importance of mobile broadband availability, which is often ignored in empirical studies. Because of the presence of spatial dependency within the data and the fact that data on business startup rates is limited to the minority of establishments that have employees, we use a Bayesian spatial Tobit estimator. After controlling for a host of variables likely to influence economic growth, we find that broadband coverage does matter and that download speeds tend to be more important than upload speeds. This pattern holds for mobile coverage as well. Perhaps the most important finding is that the results vary across business type: what matters for new businesses in one industry may not matter for other industry classifications. In the end, our results reaffirm the policy notion that access to broadband is increasingly relevant to rural entrepreneurship. © 2021 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association.","broadband; entrepreneurship; rural development","business; economic development; economic growth; entrepreneur; rural development; rural economy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114611062

Considering the important role of suppliers in the strategy framework of supply chains, it is surprising that the sourcing function has not been subject to more focused research on the development of adequate decision support tools. The relatively simplified ranking systems that often have been presented on an ad hoc basis offer only partial information on the decision. This research attempts to develop a unified and integrated structure for supplier selection practices across a supply chain on the basis of strategic planning. Our evaluation is conducted by means of a multi-attribute efficiency analysis models and a multivariate statistical method, a so-called principal component analysis-data envelopment analysis (PCA-DEA) approach, to support supplier relationship management under uncertainty. The main contribution of this paper is to address the gap in the supply chain management (SCM) literature by proposing a strategy-based method for supplier selection problems when data are interrelated and interdependent. The proposed method in this study is applied to a real-world case study in agri-food industry to demonstrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed framework. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Multivariate statistics; Strategic sourcing; Supplier selection; Supply chain management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081633146

Proxying economic and social development with human development, this study examines how improvement in human development contributes to the attainment of environmental sustainability. We use data from OECD countries for the period 1996–2016 and a battery of estimation methods (Driscoll-Kraay, instrumental variable and panel quantile regression methods). We find that a rise in human development (captured by human development index, education and human capital) leads to better environmental sustainability via reduction in ecological footprint, carbon dioxide (CO2) and total greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, and exposure to air pollution. The findings underscore that human development contributes positively towards ensuring environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental sustainability; Human development; OECD; Sustainable development goals","Economic and social effects; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Economic and social development; Environmental sustainability; Estimation methods; Human development; Instrumental panel; Instrumental variables; OECD; OECD countries; Sustainable development goal; Two-dimensions; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; ecological footprint; greenhouse gas; human development index; OECD; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122084987

Firms are thus looking for newer ways to attract, satisfy and retain those customers as their needs and aspirations change. Such newer ways constitute the firms’ quest to achieve competitive advantage. However, in this current digital era almost all the traditional “Porterian” competitive advantage barriers are difficult to sustain. Further, COVID has led to a rapid acceleration in the pace of digitalisation. Can the huge data generated in every digitally enabled entity of today be judiciously combined with other firm resources? Can this big data be transformed into meaningful knowledge which organisations can leverage to sustain and grow? Can big data provide a sustainable competitive advantage? In this conceptual paper, I use a knowledge-based approach analysed through resource-based view from the strategic management domain to search for answers to these questions. I introduce a holistic framework that integrates the following: (i) firm knowledge, (ii) managerial capabilities and decision-making, (iii) sustainable competitive advantage, (iv) big data analytics. I call this framework the “The Perpetual Model of BDA as a Sustainable Competitive Advantage”. I also propose a unique Analytic Maturity Model, which I call the SAMDDC-DAMPPC Model, which can help identify and classify firms based on their analytic maturity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; Digital age; Knowledge-based view; Maturity model; Resource-based view; Sustainable competitive advantage","Big data; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Sustainable development; 'current; Competitive advantage; Digital age; Digital era; Digital revolution; Knowledge-based approach; Knowledge-based views; Maturity model; Resource-based view; Sustainable competitive advantages; Competition; competitiveness; data set; decision making; holistic approach; industrial development; industrial practice; knowledge based system; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119182423

The prices and order quantities of both the online and the retail channels and the delivery times of the online channel are the decision variables. The demand for each product and each channel is assumed to be random and dependent on the prices of both channels and on the online delivery time. In addition, to ensure an adequate performance, service level requirements are considered and are modeled as joint chance constraints. Wasserstein uncertainty sets using the Wasserstein metric for demand probability distributions centered at the empirical distributions on the observed demands from the historical data are constructed in a data-driven approach. Accordingly, a data-driven distributionally robust joint chance constrained model is developed based on the data-driven Wasserstein uncertainty sets. A conservative CVaR approximation is used for the distributionally robust joint chance constraints. Through mathematical manipulations, the developed model is transformed into a bilinear program, which can be approximated by a mixed integer quadratic programming model using piecewise affine relaxations of the bilinear terms and can be solved efficiently. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed data-driven distributionally robust optimization approach to deal with demand uncertainties. The effects of the key parameters such as delivery time sensitivity, price sensitivity and customer channel preference are analyzed and managerial insights are provided. The results show that the decisions obtained by the proposed approach are robust to hedge against demand uncertainties. The proposed model and solution approach can provide effective decision supports for retailers selling products through an online channel and a traditional retail channel without reliable demand distribution information. Furthermore, compared with the L1-norm and the L2-norm, the L∞-norm is verified to perform better when used in the Wasserstein metric for constructing the Wasserstein uncertainty sets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven robust optimization; Demand uncertainty; Dual-channel retailing; Service level requirement; Wasserstein metric","Costs; Decision making; Integer programming; Probability distributions; Quadratic programming; Data driven; Data-driven robust optimization; Demand uncertainty; Dual channel; Dual-channel retailing; Retail channel; Robust optimization; Service level requirement; Service levels; Wasserstein metric; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118540174

Therefore, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is investigated using a Composite Index of Environmental Performance (CIEP) and Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (Panel ARDL) approach. The CIEP model is based on the Driving Force-Pressure-State- Exposure -Effects-Action (DPSEEA) framework and is generated by 19 indicators. The results of this study showed that the driving forces and pressure have negative impacts on environmental performance, thereby reducing the number of available resources. In addition, the results revealed that actions increase life expectancy while reducing the mortality rate and environmental impact. The average CIEP revealed that among MENA countries, Iran (−0.226), Algeria (−0.168), and Yemen (−0.134) had the lowest amounts, while Emirate (0.036), Kuwait (0.036), and Qatar (0.033) had the highest values. The results of the panel data model revealed a cubic polynomial correlation and an N-shaped pattern between economic growth and CIEP.

We conducted a large-scale field experiment, in which we randomly assigned 10,421,649 customer visits during a one-week-long period to one of the two approaches and measured the revenue generated per customer visit. The first approach we tested was Alibaba's current practice, which embeds product and customer features within a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm to estimate the purchase probabilities of each product for the customer at hand. The products with the largest expected revenue (revenue × predicted purchase probability) are then made available for purchase. Our second approach, which we developed and implemented in collaboration with Alibaba engineers, uses a featurized multinomial logit (MNL) model to predict purchase probabilities for each arriving customer. We used historical sales data to fit the MNL model, and then, for each arriving customer, we solved a cardinality-constrained assortment-optimization problem under the MNL model to find the optimal set of products to display. Our field experiments revealed that the MNL-based approach generated 5.17 renminbi (RMB) per customer visit, compared with the 4.04 RMB per customer visit generated by the machine-learning-based approach when both approaches were given access to the same set of the 25 most important features. This improvement represents a 28% gain in revenue per customer visit, which corresponds to a 4 million RMB improvement over the week in which the experiments were conducted. Motivated by the results of our initial field experiment, Alibaba then implemented a full-featured version of our MNL-based approach, which now serves the majority of customers in this setting. Using another small-scale field experiment, we estimate that our new MNL-based approach that utilizes the full feature set is able to increase Alibaba's annual revenue by 87.26 million RMB (12.42 million U.S. dollars).

This effect is statistically significant when FDIs occur in industries where environmental patents represent a relatively high share of total inventive activities (green-tech FDIs), and it is further reinforced if such foreign investments involve R&D activities. We also find that green-tech R&D FDIs have a larger effect in regions whose prior knowledge base is highly unrelated to environmental technologies. Furthermore, green-tech FDIs in R&D contribute to maintaining the specialisation of regions in environmental technologies over time, while it is only for high levels of unrelatedness that such FDIs help regions acquire a green-tech specialisation ex novo. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental technologies; FDIs; Green regional specialisation","Investments; Knowledge based systems; Patents and inventions; Business studies; Eco-innovation; Environmental patent; Foreign direct investments; Foreign investment; Green regional specialization; Green technology; Greenfield; International business; Specialisation; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122505356

As industry and academia have repeatedly confirmed, such social communications are now significantly changing firms' business and management practices. This paper studies how social communications affect an upstream firm's product line design in the platform economy when an online platform makes strategic contract choices. We show that for both wholesale and agency contracts, social communications increase the product line length while decreasing the product price and quality. We also identify the conditions under which social communications provide a firm with fewer incentives for product line extension under a wholesale contract than under an agency contract. On the platform side, we show that an agency contract can be preferred in the presence of social communications over a wholesale contract if and only if the commission rate is sufficiently high or both the commission rate and the product line extension fee are moderate. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agency contract; Platform economy; product line design; social communications; wholesale contract","Economic and social effects; Agency contract; Business and management; Business practices; Management practises; Platform economy; Product line design; Product line extensions; Social communications; Social media; Wholesale contract; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121777529

In this article, the authors review empirical research on how these shifts have changed buyer–seller negotiations, an important type of buyer–seller interactions. Several insights arise from this review. First, the shifts have caused fundamental changes in buyers’ and sellers’ roles, power, and aspirations and information processing. Second, the shifts and these fundamental changes together cause major changes in buyer–seller interactional processes and outcomes, including (1) change in buyers’ attitude and behavior, (2) change in sellers’ effectiveness in interacting with buyers, and (3) change in buyer–seller interactional processes. Based on these insights, the authors develop a research agenda to guide the reexamination of existing theories and the development of new theories of buyer–seller interactions. © 2021, Academy of Marketing Science.","Buyer–seller; Digital; Information asymmetry; Interactions; Negotiation; Sales; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116283077

Nowadays, these products also include a wide range of digital innovations. Given that many responses to the pandemic are technology driven, stakeholders involved in the development and manufacturing of crisis-critical products are likely to face intellectual property (IP)-related challenges. To (governmental) decision makers, IP challenges might not appear to be of paramount urgency compared to the many undoubtedly huge operational challenges to deploy critical resources. However, if IP challenges are considered too late, they may cause delays to urgently mobilize resources effectively. Innovation stakeholders could then be reluctant to fully engage in the development and manufacturing of crisis-critical products. This article adopts an IP and innovation perspective to learn from the currently unfolding COVID-19 pandemic using secondary data, including patent data, synthesized with an IP roadmap. We focus on technical aspects related to research, development, and upscaling of capacity to manufacture crisis-critical products in the huge volumes suddenly in demand. In this article, we offer a set of contributions. We provide a structure, framework, and language for those concerned with steering clear of IP challenges to avoid delays in fighting a pandemic. We provide a reasoning why IP needs to be considered earlier rather than too late in a global health crisis. Major stakeholders we identify include 1) governments; 2) manufacturing firms owning existing crisis-critical IP (incumbents in crisis-critical sectors); 3) manufacturing firms normally not producing crisis-critical products suddenly rushing into crisis-critical sectors to support the manufacturing of crisis-critical products in the quantities that far exceed incumbents' production capacities; and 4) voluntary grassroot initiatives that form during a pandemic, often by highly skilled engineers and scientists in order to contribute to the development and dissemination of crisis-critical products. For these major stakeholders, we draw up three scenarios, from which we identify associated IP challenges they face related to the development and manufacturing of technologies and products for 1) prevention (of spread); 2) diagnosis of infected patients; and 3) the development of treatments. This article provides a terminology to help policy and other decision makers to discuss IP considerations during pandemics.

We show that both indices spiked during news related to new developments in CBDC and in relation to digital currency news items. We demonstrate that CBDC indices have a significant negative relationship with the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE All-World Index, and positive with the volatilities of cryptocurrency markets, foreign exchange markets, bond markets, VIX, and gold. Our results suggest that financial markets are more sensitive to CBDC Uncertainty than CBDC Attention as proxy by these indices.

This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that, provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Climate change adaptation; Digital technologies","Climate change; Surveys; Changing climate; Classifieds; Climate change adaptation; Digital technologies; Digitisation; Interdisciplinary teams; Management issues; Questionnaire surveys; Systematic Review; Artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence; climate change; social change; survey method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128196810

Our results show that coin-ranking sites, such as Coinmarketcap, Coingecko and BraveNewCoin (i) include most of the cryptocurrency trading activity and (ii) are essentially characterised by the same underlying processes as the main exchange platforms (Coinbase and Bitstamp) and alternative coin-ranking sites (Cryptocompare), regardless of the possible issues arising from the aggregation of different exchanges to compute a unique cryptocurrency price. Therefore, we state that these databases are appropriate to conduct research. At any rate, we observe that all the databases analysed in this paper show the same underlying process for most liquid cryptocurrencies; consequently, scholars could use any of them for their studies, as long as they consider the different trading activity included by each database. This result is supported by an empirical analysis focused on weak-form market efficiency, since we report the same degree of efficiency regardless of the database and exchange platform. Nevertheless, we recognise the need for further research, given the gap in the literature and the black-box method used by coin-ranking sites to compute a unique cryptocurrency price. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Data; Efficiency; Scaling behaviour",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125414216

Good policy arrangements align the legal and regulatory framework with the technical and economic characteristics of the sector and the broader, social visions for new technologies. Because the future development of 5G technology and markets is open-ended, policy has to be developed with incomplete knowledge and under conditions of uncertainty. These circumstances call for adaptive forms of policy and a focus on the creation of guardrails for market players, backed up by regulatory powers to intervene more directly if necessary. In the technologically dynamic 5G system, multiple stable policy constellations are feasible, but they likely will result in divergent outcomes and performance characteristics.

Although the potential of VR is to increase the effectiveness and productivity of the project phases from initial concept design to detailed design preparation. VR adoption in the United Kingdom (UK) Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is slow compared to other sectors. This research focuses on ascertaining the drivers and barriers of VR in construction projects in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts an online survey design. It uses Bristol Online Survey (BOS) to create a structured questionnaire that is used to assess UK construction professionals using a convenience sampling technique. Therefore, researcher uses descriptive and inferential technique for data analysis and presentation based on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to analyze the questionnaire. Findings: The research findings revealed the most significant barriers to VR adoption in UK construction industry were lack of skills/expertise and cultural change. Hence, the main drivers of VR adoption as rated by the professionals in the UK construction industry are improved safety, improved quality and improved productivity. Practical implications: The identification and assessment of the drivers and barriers to VR adoption could advance VR adoption among construction professionals and other stakeholders of the UK AEC sector. This could also be extended to developing countries, given the status of VR as being in the developing stage. Originality/value: This study provides valuable insights to construction professionals and stakeholders to plan actions that could enhance the drivers and mitigate the barriers of VR. This study's main contribution is to group and classify various drivers and barriers into easily understood categories, in order to potentiate the drivers and reduce the barriers effectively. The groupings could be used as benchmarks in similar studies in developing countries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AEC industry; Barriers; Drivers; United Kingdom; Virtual reality adoption","3D modeling; Accident prevention; Construction; Construction industry; Developing countries; Electronic assessment; Productivity; Surveys; Architectural engineering; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Design/methodology/approach; Early design stages; Statistical packages; Three dimensional (3-D) modeling; UK construction industry; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106316192

Justice-driven privacy protection outlines a method to manage this trade-off. We built on the theoretical lens of justice theory to integrate justice provision with key privacy protection features and conceptualized the extent to which these features affect privacy concerns and information disclosure behavior. Notably, we proposed an information technology (IT) solution to balance the trade-off between privacy protection and consumer data collection. In the context of mobile banking applications, we prototyped a theory-driven IT solution, referred to as negotiation, active-recommendation privacy policy application, which enables customer service agents to interact with and actively recommend personalized privacy policies to consumers. We benchmarked our solution through a field experiment relative to two conventional applications: a non-negotiation privacy policy application (only a nonnegotiable privacy statement is posted) as a base method and a negotiation, non-active-recommendation privacy policy application (only a negotiation feature is integrated with the privacy policy). The results showed that the proposed negotiation, active-recommendation privacy policy application decreased privacy concerns and increased consumers’ information disclosure intentions and actual disclosure behavior. A post hoc analysis corroborated these findings, indicating that our design enhanced perceived procedural justice, interactional justice, and distributive justice among consumers and made them feel comfortable to disclose their personal information.

Linear models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear models such as the artificial neural network (ANN) have been adopted in the literature for forecasting construction costs. However, both linear and nonlinear models are subject to some limitations derived from their modeling structure and assumptions. This study proposes a hybrid ARIMA-ANN model for forecasting construction costs and explores whether the hybrid ARIMA-ANN model can provide more accurate forecasts than an individual ARIMA or ANN. The national and city-level construction cost indices (CCIs) are forecasted for three forecasting horizons (short-term, mid-term, and long-term) using three forecasting models: (1) linear ARIMA, (2) nonlinear ANNs, and (3) the hybrid ARIMA-ANN model. Out-of-sample forecasting exercise reveals that the hybrid model combining the distinctive features of both ARIMA and ANNs performs better than individual models in most forecasting cases, especially for longer-term forecasting horizons. The findings can help project planners, cost engineers, and decision makers prepare for more accurate budgets and bids for diverse construction projects in different locations. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; City-level Engineering News-Record (ENR) construction cost index (CCI); Hybrid model; Out-of-sample forecasting; US cities","Budget control; Cost engineering; Costs; Decision making; Neural networks; Nonlinear systems; Artificial neural network; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average model; City-level engineering news-record construction cost index; Construction costs indices; Engineering news records; Hybrid model; Moving average model; Out-of-sample forecasting; US city; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121301520

As such, a disruption can wreak havoc to a supply chain network, rendering the ability of a firm to respond to these disruptions with appropriate recovery strategies paramount. In this paper, we analyze such recovery strategies in a supply chain network. The specific model we develop aims at predicting a disruption that may occur in a context where smart contracts have been implemented based on blockchain technology. Within this setting, we suggest appropriate measures to be undertaken by an organization to mitigate the disruption and avoid negative performance outcomes as much as possible. If the disruption cannot be avoided, the proposed genetic algorithm-based approach focuses on adopting re-active measures to manage the post-disruption reality. As such, we effectively integrate both pre- and post-disruption scenarios to offer wholistic decision-support in an integrated fashion, extending prior work which mostly developed guidance only for either pre- or post-disruption responses. Specifically, we study the performance of a complex multi-echelon supply chain network, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, under various conditions. The insights derived discern the effect of mitigation measures during a disruption, offering valuable guidance for decision makers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Disruptions; Genetic algorithm; Performance; Robustness; Supply chain management","Complex networks; Computer system recovery; Decision making; Decision support systems; Recovery; Smart contract; Supply chain management; Block-chain; Decision supports; Disruption; Integrated fashion; Multi echelon supply chains; Performance; Performance outcome; Recovery strategies; Robustness; Supply chain network; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121147670

They play an important role in productivity growth, which is crucial for developed economies as they adjust to major trends such as the industrial revolution, an ageing population and changes in the nature of work. This study maps the SME productivity research landscape by way of a systematic literature review focusing on the direct, indirect and mediating/moderating factors that enable or constrain productivity in SMEs. We review 109 empirical studies and highlight the fragmented nature of the extant research in this field. Our thematic analysis identifies six key themes, namely organisational environment, organisational capabilities, investments, types of innovation, external knowledgebase and commercialisation. By taking stock of existing knowledge, we highlight critical gaps and methodological issues that limit our understanding of SME productivity. We propose a future research agenda to address current shortcomings and advance knowledge on this topic.

Individuals with disabilities, an already socially disadvantaged population, are more vulnerable to and have likely been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 response conditions. Yet, the extent to which the daily community living activities of people with disabilities have been impacted is unknown. Thus, this study assesses their travel behavior and community living during the COVID-19 pandemic conditions compared with those of the general population. A web survey was conducted using Qualtrics's online panel data (respondents included 232 people with disabilities and 161 people without disabilities). Regression models found that people with disabilities reduced their daily travel to a greater extent but at varying degrees, depending on the destination types and travel modes. Reductions in taxi rides (including ride-hailing services) were most significant among people with cognitive and sensory (e.g., vision and hearing) disabilities. By place type, cognitive disability was associated with a trip reduction for multiple destination types—grocery, restaurants, outdoor recreation, indoor recreation, and healthcare providers. Findings from this study could contribute to decision- and policy-making in planning, transportation, and community services during the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic, in future major public health crises, and post-COVID, because the adjustments in travel behavior and community living might be longer-term. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Activities of daily community living; Disabled people; Individuals with disabilities; Pandemic","Audition; Behavioral research; Regression analysis; Surveys; % reductions; Activity of daily community living; Condition; Disabled people; General population; Individual with disability; Pandemic; People with disabilities; Travel behaviour; Web surveys; Taxicabs; cognition; COVID-19; decision making; disability; diurnal variation; policy making; public health; taxi transport; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121919009

Countries wield considerable technology adoption power and their adoption activities can be leveraged to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by endorsing specific technologies. To encourage greater adoption, it is vital to determine the predictors of technology adoption to design effective promotion policies, accomplished through the modification of Diffusion of Innovation theory. While there is substantial research in individual consumer adoption behavior, less is known about country level factors that impact technology adoption. To overcome these gaps in the research, we undertook an investigative study to better understand the predictors of a country's technology adoption rate. We use a random effects panel model to predict technology adoption factors for a sample of 15 countries over the period of 2010–2019 using secondary datasets. We identify a statistically significant effect of competitiveness, cybersecurity, ease of doing business, and the level of political stability/non-violence and terrorism. We thus posit that a country that is highly competitive, has enhanced cybersecurity, is easy to do business in, and has a low level of political violence and terrorism adopts new technologies more readily than others. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Competitiveness; Country-level analysis; Cybersecurity; Ease of doing business; Panel data; Political stability; Technology adoption rate","Consumer behavior; Environmental technology; Random processes; Terrorism; Country-level analyse; Cyber security; Ease of doing business; Economic growths; Panel data; Political stability; Power; Predictive models; Technology adoption; Technology adoption rate; Competition; competitiveness; economic growth; innovation; panel data; political system; technological development; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121255250

We also investigate the mediating roles of organisational agility, ESM infrastructure and knowledge sharing on the relationship between ESM usage and decision-making effectiveness. To empirically test this model, data was collected through a survey from the employees of public/private emergency and disaster management organisations during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The results confirm that ESM usage indirectly affects decision-making effectiveness, which ultimately improves organisations’ operational and social performance. Organisational agility and ESM infrastructure are strong mediators of the link between ESM usage and decision-making effectiveness, while the mediating effect of knowledge sharing through ESM is weaker. In addition to presenting theoretical rationale and empirical evidence, the study enables us to outline policy guidelines for social media managers of disaster management organisations, who must develop ESM strategies in order to boost operational and social performance.

To reflect different aspects of climate exposure, we include both self-reported climate shocks and spatially interpolated weather data. The assessment of 1127 households shows that while both districts have similar exposure and adaptive capacity levels, the sensitivity dimension makes Vaishali more vulnerable to climate change. To reduce sensitivity, decision-makers should focus on improving infrastructure (e.g., permanent housing, latrines, health centers, alternative energy sources). To improve adaptive capacity and reduce climate risk in both regions, policymakers should promote the expansion of extension training for livelihood diversification, information and communication technologies as well as conservation agriculture. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; India; Livelihood vulnerability; Smallholders","alternative energy; climate change; comparative study; decision making; livelihood; smallholder; vulnerability; Bihar; Gangetic Plain; Haryana; India; Karnal; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106309610

Distributed preference relation (DPR) extends BDs to the form of pairwise comparison by expressing the preferred, non-preferred, indifferent, and uncertain degrees of one decision alternative over another. However, previous studies on DPR only require comparison of adjacent alternatives, and consensus reaching is not considered fully in the decision making process. To solve this problem, a complete DPR model is presented in this paper to support group decision making (GDM). First, a consistency index is defined to measure the consistency level of the complete DPR representing experts’ judgments. Second, an automatic adjustment algorithm is proposed to improve the consistency of DPRs with unacceptable consistency to an acceptable level. Third, the evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm is utilized to aggregate all the DPRs together, and an optimization model is further constructed to generate experts’ weights, which maximizes the degree of consensus among experts. A GDM example is provided to illustrate the applicability and validity of the proposed DPR model, and comparative analysis demonstrates the potential of the proposed method in supporting real-world GDM problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Consensus; Consistency; Distributed preference relation; Evidential reasoning; Group decision making","Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Consensus; Consistency; Distributed preference relation; Evidential reasoning; Group Decision Making; Opinion fusions; Preference relation; Qualitative information; Relation models; Subjective uncertainty; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120647270

Although DDRPs offer new opportunities for commerce and sustainability, challenges exist to support wide adoption. This study attempts to develop a deeper understanding of the reasons underlying seller resistance to the DDRP. Grounded in the innovation resistance theory (IRT), the research model of this study is validated using data collected from 307 Chinese potential sellers of used digital devices. Using the structural equation modeling techniques, this study reveals that perceived security and privacy risk, attitudes toward sustainability, and negative word-of-mouth have a significant impact on seller resistance to DDRP. Finally, the control variable, education, negatively affects seller resistance. These findings not only offer important theoretical contributions to green IT research but also provide guidance to DDRP operators for formulating strategies to reduce seller resistance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Green information technology; Innovation resistance; Online platforms; Online recycling; Sustainability","Commerce; Recycling; Sales; Sustainable development; Green information technology; Innovation resistance; Online platforms; Online recycling; Perceived securities; Privacy risks; Research models; Security and privacy; Security risks; Structural equation modeling techniques; Digital devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121920696

A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from managers and decision-makers in the retail industry. Data of 2278 respondents were analysed through structural equation modelling. The findings revealed that security concerns, external support, top management support, and rational decision making culture have a greater effect on BDA adoption in developed countries UK than in UAE and Egypt. However, competition intensity and firm size have a greater effect on BDA adoption in UAE and Egypt than in UK. Finally, human variables (competence of information system's staff and staff's information system knowledge) have a greater effect on BDA adoption in Egypt than UK and UAE.

However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms through which multilevel (i.e., organizational, group, and individual) factors collectively influence GSC as promoted by general contractors in construction. A model is proposed to examine the interactions and causal relationships between four multilevel factors - organizational-level safety climate (OSC), coworker support (CS), supervisory safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL), individual psychological capital (PsyCap) - and GSC. A two-wave online survey was conducted within a large contractor company in the US over 2 years. A total of 280 employees completed both surveys. The structural equation modeling analysis technique was adopted to test the hypotheses. The results show that OSC, CS, and supervisory SSTL significantly contribute to GSC. In addition, supervisory SSTL and CS positively affect individual PsyCap, and PsyCap positively moderates the relationship between supervisory SSTL and GSC. The study suggests that construction contractors should consider implementing leadership and PsyCap interventions to cultivate a positive GSC that potentially can lead to improved safety performance. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Coworker support (CS); Psychological capital (PsyCap); Safety climate; Structural equation modeling; Supervisory leadership","Climate models; Construction industry; Contractors; Surveys; Co-worker supports; Coworker support; Group level; Organizational factors; Psychological capital; Psychological capitals; Safety climate; Structural equation models; Supervisory leadership; Transformational leadership; Accident prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116839098

Therefore, paying attention to the critical factors impacting firm sustainable growth can help operators get out of the predicament.

To reconcile this debate, this article distinguishes between creative and commercial success (i.e., novelty vs. profitability), and examines how these outcomes are variously influenced by a start-up's hierarchy. This study suggests that while a flatter hierarchy can improve ideation and creative success, it can result in haphazard execution and commercial failure by overwhelming managers with the burden of direction and causing subordinates to drift into power struggles and aimless idea explorations. I find empirical support for this trade-off using a large sample of game development start-ups. These findings offer one resolution to the debate by sorting out the conditions under which hierarchy can be conducive or detrimental to start-ups. Managerial summary: Academics, management gurus, and popular media outlets have argued that “authoritarian,” tall hierarchies are outmoded and will be supplanted by “egalitarian,” flat structures. In recent years, this argument has been largely substantiated by a few “successful” flat start-ups, such as Valve, Zappos, Github, Medium, and Buffer. As these nascent firms constantly garner much attention for their egalitarian ideal—which itself is a signal of their rarity—the myth that start-ups should be flat (often referred to as “flat organization,” “holacracy,” or “boss-less firm”) has become widespread among entrepreneurs. My study cautions against this myth, suggesting that adding a few hierarchical levels of managers can substantially help start-ups achieve commercial success and survive in their hostile environments, albeit at a potentially marginal cost of creativity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","entrepreneurship; hierarchy; organizational design; organizational structure; start-up","Economic and social effects; Creative success; Flat structures; Game development; Hierarchical level; Hostile environments; Management guru; Marginal costs; Organizational structures; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113787672

A difficult task in managing such relationships is creating value when there is a lack of justice. This study examines whether supply chain analytics capability (SCAC) and adaptation can prove useful for suppliers in extracting greater value from supply chain relationships. The role of SCAC in driving value has not been evaluated in contexts where independent decision making is constrained, such as the case for a power disadvantaged supplier. We use resource orchestration theory and social exchange theory to develop a model that explains how SCAC and adaptation can work in BSRs and test it using data from North American suppliers. The results show that in relationships marked by low levels of procedural justice, SCAC becomes critical in extracting value from the relationship, while in relationships marked by high levels of procedural justice, adaptation is more important. The findings lead to actionable insights on how suppliers can leverage SCAC and adaptation to maximize value from supply chain relationships. A key insight is that benefits from firm-level capabilities, like SCAC, depend on relational attributes in the supply chain context. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; justice; Supply chain analytics capability; supply chain relationships","Decision making; In contexts; North American; Procedural justice; Social exchange theory; Supplier relationships; Supply chain relationships; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092940238

In this paper, we provide a mathematical model to assist governmental policymakers in managing the lost lives during a pandemic through controlling intervention levels. Our model is non-convex in decision variables, and we develop two heuristics to obtain fast and high-quality solutions. Our results indicate that when anticipated economic consequences are higher, healthcare overcapacity will emerge. When the projected economic costs of the pandemic are large and the illness severity is low, however, a no-intervention strategy may be preferable. As the severity of the infection rises, the cost of intervention climbs accordingly. The death toll also increases with the severity of both the economic consequences of interventions and the infection rate of the disease. Our models suggest earlier mitigation strategies that typically start before the saturation of the healthcare system when disease severity is high. © 2021","Heuristics; Optimization; OR in healthcare; Pandemic","Costs; Economic and social effects; Decision variables; Direct and indirect costs; Economic consequences; Government intervention; Heuristic; High-quality solutions; Optimisations; OR in healthcare; Pandemic; Policy makers; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124095701

Design/methodology/approach: The technique used for prioritization is the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Findings: The commitment and involvement of the top management, i.e. the leadership team, is the most critical success factor in the successful implementation of TPM. Employee training is another vital factor. Top management should also encourage a culture favorable for information flow, equipment ownership, the involvement of people and quality management throughout the organization. Research limitations/implications: Manufacturing organizations interested in improving productivity through the implementation of TPM should first involve the leadership team and seek their full support and train all the employees in this philosophy. However, the findings cannot be generalized for global application due to the inputs taken from experts in AHP from limited geography. Practical implications: Reducing production costs is a universal expectation of business leaders. TPM can be used as a long-term strategy to improve productivity by the organization. Social implications: All employees have to be trained in this philosophy, and as part of the training and the implementation of TPM, they feel empowered and committed to the organization. Originality/value: This study has illustrated the use of AHP for the prioritization of success factors.

Hence, with the aim of improving the uncertainty management and facilitating the weighting criteria, this paper introduces an improved fuzzy Einstein Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methodology. Such a CoCoSo model improves previous CoCoSo proposals by using nonlinear fuzzy weighted Einstein functions for defining weighted sequences. In addition, it proposes a novel algorithm for determining the criteria weights based on the fuzzy logarithmic function, therefore it allows decision-makers a better perception of the relationship between the criteria, as it considers the relationships between adjacent criteria; high consistency of expert comparisons; and enables the definition of weighting coefficients of a larger set of criteria, without the need to cluster (group) the criteria. Nonlinear fuzzy Einstein functions implemented in the fuzzy Einstein CoCoSo methodology enable the processing of complex and uncertain information. Such characteristics contribute to the rational definition of compromise strategies and enable objective reasoning when solving real-world decision problems. The efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed fuzzy Einstein CoCoSo model are illustrated by a case study to create a conceptual framework to evaluate and rank the prioritization of public transportation management at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal its good performance in determining the transportation management systems strategy. © 2022 The Author(s)","CoCoSo; Einstein norms; Fuzzy sets; Logarithmic additive function; Public transportation management","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Decision making; Additive function; Combined compromize solution; Einstein functions; Einstein norm; Inherent complexity; Logarithmic additive function; Optimal decision making; Public transportation management; Solution methodology; Solution model; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134799911

The main findings are as follows: First, CPU significantly reduces firm-level TFP, with a greater impact on low-productivity firms than on high-productivity firms; second, the negative effect of CPU on firm-level TFP is most pronounced for non-state-owned, labor-intensive, and capital-intensive companies; third, CPU hinders research and development investment and reduces the amount of free cash flow. These results indicate that CPU exerts negative impacts on firm-level TFP mainly via its effects on the capital status of the companies. Our findings remain valid after a series of robustness tests and controlling for endogeneity.

Nonetheless, this area is not adequately studied, and numerous results are apparent throughout the literature. For massive economic development, it is vital to recognize the role of human capital, urbanization, and natural resources. Hence it is important to consider various factors that can play a constructive role in environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between total natural resources (TNR), gross domestic product (GDP), human capital index (HCI) and urbanization (URB) with ecological footprint (EFP) in Pakistan from 1980 to 2018. The research uses the latest versions of dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations model. The key benefit of dynamic ARDL is to estimate positive and negative shifts between the selected variables with an immediate visual illustration over the short and long period. In addition, the Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) machine learning method is used to test robustness. The results show that the rise in TNR has a long-term detrimental influence on EFP. However, upsurge in GDP and HCI increases EFP in the long-term. Lastly, URB observed an important and detrimental long-term impact on the EFP. The KRLS also support the hypothesis. This study suggest a policies to the planners and government officials for managing rapid urbanization and minimizing its urban, environmental and economic challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","DARDL; Ecological footprint; GDP; Human capital; Natural resources; Urbanization","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Personnel; Auto-regressive; DARDL; Ecological footprint; Economic growths; Gross domestic products; Human capital indices; Human capitals; Natural resource economics; Regularized least squares; Urbanization; Sustainable development; ecological footprint; economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; human capital; least squares method; machine learning; natural resource; regression analysis; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131217131

This category of waste, in contrast to products that are removed based on reaching their best before or use-by date, are also having little potential for redistribtion, and may thus be most targeted in future waste reduction legislative initiatives. We develop some relatively easy to calculate measures to help a retailer with identifying the financial implications of waste production in relation to some supply source characteristics, the financial motivation of its supplier to tackle item deterioration at the retailer level, and how this is affected by the level of logistics collaboration.

A conceptual model is proposed, using a multi-case study approach involving high-tech start-ups that have attended accelerator and incubator programs in Greater London, United Kingdom. The research involved 32 semistructured interviews with chief executive officers and cofounders of start-up companies. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurs are influenced by various forms of knowledge spillover which assist in determining the strategic decision of the company, in terms of formation, including partnerships or alliances, allocation of Research and Development budgets, and engagement in product innovation. Further observations confirm that high-tech start-ups focus on a fast pace of constant product innovation to cover identified gaps in the market. One significant finding is that start-ups use various technological platforms to access knowledge spillovers which challenge the ideas of geographical proximity present in existing KSTE understanding. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Absorptive capacity; accelerator programs; entrepreneurship; high-tech start-ups; knowledge spillovers; product innovation","Economics; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Industry; Knowledge engineering; Absorptive capacity; Accelerator projects; entrepreneurship; High tech; Knowledge spillovers; Product innovation; Research and development; Technological innovation; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069903007

This collaboration seems so necessary in the food industry as a major contributor to environmental, social and economic problems. This paper aims to identify, analyse the influential network relationship and prioritise the key success factors (KSFs) of international collaboration formation in the entrepreneurial food industry with a case study on Iran's emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach: To identify a list of KSFs, a qualitative method, literature review, is initially used. A quantitative method, fuzzy-Delphi, then is employed to finalise the main KSFs based on the entrepreneurial food industry experts' opinion. To analyse the causal relationship, and prioritise the KSFs, a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-analytic network process (ANP) methodology, i.e. FDANP, is applied. At the first stage, the cause–effect diagram of KSFs is extracted using fuzzy DEMATEL and then, the KSFs weights and priorities are evaluated using a fuzzy ANP. Findings: The results illustrate that the characteristics of effective development workers are the leading dimension of a successful international collaboration that directly affects other dimensions. On the other hand, increased marketing and trading is the most important KSF that is directly related to international entrepreneurial collaboration team capabilities and professionalism. The leading and casual role of team members also plays a vital role in strategic and communication issues affecting the collaboration success, e.g. market research and new product development. Availability of financial resources and the ability of partners in continuous financing is also a crucial and required factor for a successful collaboration. Originality/value: Using an extensive review of the literature to extract the KSFs of international entrepreneurial collaboration and finalising them using a fuzzy-Delphi method and examining the cause-effect relations between them, as well as prioritising the KSFs are the main contributions of this paper. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerging economy; Entrepreneurial food industry; Fuzzy ANP; Fuzzy DEMATEL; International collaboration formation","article; decision making; Delphi study; financial management; food industry; human; Iran; product development; professionalism; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; worker",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116795443

The findings indicate that CCP has a positive impact on firm performance (Tobin’s Q). The authors also investigate the impact of External Stakeholder Involvement in CSR initiatives. The results suggest that when external stakeholders are involved in an organization’s CSR initiatives, both CCP and firm performance (Tobin’s Q) improve. In addition, third-party evaluations of CSR performance positively moderate the impact of External Stakeholder Involvement on CCP.

Academic/practical relevance: Logistics is critical for e-commerce. It is intriguing that the third-party sellers that use FBA may directly compete with Amazon. By FBA, their service levels are substantially improved and so is their competitiveness. Such a phenomenon has been little investigated in prior literature. Methodology: We develop a strategic competition model where Amazon and a representative third-party seller engage in both price and service competition. Results: Interestingly, we find that although FBA may intensify the service competition between Amazon and the third-party seller, it can mitigate their price competition besides the direct revenue Amazon collects from the service. The latter effects dominate the former when the cross-service sensitivity of the consumers is either sufficiently low or sufficiently high. Therefore, not only the third-party sellers but also Amazon may benefit from FBA. Moreover, because the sales of Amazon’s products may increase because of FBA, its OEM (original equipment manufacturer) supplier may gain from FBA also. These findings extend to the settings where the third-party seller is Amazon’s OEM supplier, cross-price and cross-service sensitivities are correlated, or the parties set their retail prices sequentially. Managerial implications: Our analysis provides insights about when FBA is more likely to be beneficial and when it can be harmful. They are useful for understanding the impacts of FBA on both Amazon and the third-party sellers. © 2022 INFORMS","e-commerce platform; FBA; price; service competition","Costs; Electronic commerce; Sales; Commerce platforms; E- commerces; E-commerce platform; FBA; Original equipment manufacturers; Price; Problem definition; Service competition; Strategic perspectives; Third parties; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131008588

Based on real-world transaction data from the largest online retailer in China, JD.com, this study builds a three-level hierarchical promotion structure and evaluates the impact of different platform promotions on sales and conversion rate. We find that monetary promotions have a stronger impact on sales than gift promotions. Among monetary promotions, standard promotions are more influential than coupon promotions. And among standard promotions, direct and quantity promotions are more effective than bundle promotions. Moreover, we find that the platforms' business model (i.e., reseller or marketplace) and product line length have significant moderating effects on the impact of quantity promotions on both sales and the conversion rate, while the moderating effects on direct promotions are only observed on its impact on sales.

In this study, we first analyse whether consumers are willing to bring a reusable coffee cup (RCC) under the condition of a monetary incentive (qualitative decision) and the minimum discount required for individuals to be willing to use an RCC (quantitative decision). Second, we analyse the explanatory factors impacting these two decisions. Several factors are proposed to explain an individual's willingness to bring an RCC including their environmental knowledge and involvement, and personal restrictions for using an RCC. An empirical application, conducted on 1,371 individuals using a Heckit model, allows us to conduct a joint modelling and provide a novel methodological contribution to the study of the willingness, and barriers, of individuals towards the use of RCCs in the coffee shop industry. © 2022 The Authors","Discount; Environmental sustainability; Monetary incentive; Reusable products; Sustainable consumption","consumption behavior; discount rate; empirical analysis; incentive; numerical model; qualitative analysis; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122650114

We draw on the policy design and tax incentive literature to shed light on how two policy design choices – the nature and targeting of the incentive - shape the innovation effectiveness of a high- and new-technology enterprise tax incentive programme in China. We first find evidence that, on average, the programme can stimulate increases in firm R&D and patenting. Not all firms benefit equally, however. Second, we find that firms with larger incentives experience greater innovation impacts, but that high incentive values may crowd out R&D. We also find multiyear incentives to be effective for stimulating firm innovation in all years, but only in the initial years for R&D. Finally, for targeting, following a ‘picking winners’ strategy may enhance programme effectiveness as we find stronger innovation impacts for firms with greater programme experience, certification likelihood, and innovation experience. Our study contributes by helping resolve the theoretical ambiguity about how policy design choices about tax incentives' value, duration, and targeting can impact innovation effectiveness, by providing insights on the effectiveness and heterogeneity of the innovation impacts of tax incentives in emerging economies, and by providing more explicit guidance on how to design tax incentive programmes to raise R&D and innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Innovation; Picking winners; Policy design; Public support; Tax incentives","Economics; Patents and inventions; China; Effective programs; High and new technology enterprise; Innovation; Picking winner; Policy design; Program design; Public support; Tax incentive; Tax incentive programs; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119423293

Comprising 44 supply and demand indicators of the NTE, the index was composed of an overall index and six major sub-indices that measured the vitality of six typical NTE subsectors, including catering, shopping, recreation, accommodation, touring, and fitness. The NTEVI was calculated using a unique multi-source dataset based on hourly online transaction data from a leading Chinese online-to-offline service platform, monthly night-time electricity consumption data, and official statistics from 2019 to 2020. Robustness and sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure high credibility of the index results. The findings of this study suggested that the NTEVI was highly and significantly correlated with night light indices, economic indicators, and tourism demand measures. By identifying regional and temporal differences across several service sectors over time at the county, city, and provincial levels, the NTEVI serves as a powerful numerical and visual tool: it offers key information to guide policy formulation, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. In the context of COVID-19, the index analyses also reflect the NTE recovery process in Zhejiang Province.

We first use a Bayesian dynamic factor model to decompose the house price movements into a national, four regional (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), and state-specific factors. We then study the ability of macroeconomic uncertainty in forecasting the comovements in housing prices, by controlling for a wide-array of predictors, such as factors derived from a large macroeconomic dataset, oil shocks, and financial market-related uncertainties. To accommodate for multiple predictors and nonlinearities, we take a machine learning approach of random forests. Our results provide strong evidence of forecastability of the national house price factor based on the information content of macroeconomic uncertainties over and above the other predictors. This result also carries over, albeit by a varying degree, to the factors associated with the four census regions, and the overall house price growth of the US economy. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainty is found to have predictive content for (stochastic) volatility of the national factor and aggregate US house price.

We find that a less risk-averse creator should choose a high-price high-financing-target strategy when backer warm-glow effect is strong, or vice versa. The creator should only target at backers who have high project valuation when there is a large variation among backer valuation, and should target at all potential backers when the variation is small. In addition, we also explore the impacts of backer risk aversion. We reveal that the creator can only select a low-price low-financing-target strategy when the overall backer risk-aversion is high. However, the creator is not restricted to the low-price low-financing-target strategy when the overall risk-aversion is low.

This model holds the promise of engaging a broad and varied community of individuals in innovation activities. However, SPD platforms have struggled to scale early successes and build momentum to become sustainable. To critically assess the viability and paths forward for SPD, we examine social innovation processes, technologies, and platform governance that underlie this open innovation model. We identify six process functions - social engagement, ideation, experiential communication, social validation, codevelopment, and cocommercialization - to model SPD. We examine how these functions are enabled or supported by social technologies and cogoverned by an innovation community, innovation sponsor, and partners in manufacturing and retailing. We assessed the proposed SPD model with case studies of two SPD platforms. This article contributes to the innovation process modeling literature a comprehensive, integrated model of SPD processes, technology, and governance. This holistic model provides a new framework for systematic investigations of SPD for further theorization and empirical study. The proposed model is sufficiently general yet grounded in the phenomenon to guide design, deployment, and governance of socially enabled open innovation. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Crowdsourcing; innovation management; open innovation; process modeling; social computing; social product development","Crowdsourcing; Job analysis; Process engineering; Product development; Social computing; Collaboration; Commercialization; Innovation management; Open innovation; Process Modeling; Task analysis; Technological innovation; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097713500

Yet it is unclear how UGC and MGC jointly affect the overall market reaction, when digital content is freely available to all consumers. To fill the gap, we integrate the UGC and MGC literature and research of determinants of physical exercise to develop a comprehensive conceptual model. Using a dataset collected from a leading online fitness brand, we find that both UGC and MGC affect a free fitness video's incremental view count. We further categorize UGC into three dimensions, where favorability represents the normative dimension, various textual features represent the informational dimension, and reply-density of the self-organized reviewer community represents the social dimension. While both normative and social UGC are positively associated with online fitness videos' view count increase, the impact of informational UGC is insignificant. More importantly, product features, such as exercise intensity, moderate the impacts of UGC and MGC on free digital content consumption. When facing strenuous exercises, the consumer group relies more on peer users and less on marketers to make their content consumption decisions. The findings provide insightful implications to understand how consumers decide their engagement with free digital content delivered via social media channels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Digital workout; Exercise intensity; Free digital content consumption; Marketer-generated content; Social media; User-generated content","Commerce; Decision making; Health; Consumer decision making; Content consumption; Digital contents; Digital workout; Exercise intensity; Free digital content consumption; Marketer-generated content; Social media; User-generated; User-generated content; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116858111

Because of the large number of affected resources and the absence of detailed, timely and accurate information, currently existing disruption management techniques cannot be applied in out-of-control situations. Most of the contemporary approaches assume that there is only one single disruption with a known duration, that all information about the resources is available, and that all stakeholders in the operations act as expected. Another limitation is the lack of knowledge about why and how disruptions accumulate and whether this process can be predicted. To tackle these problems, we develop a multidisciplinary framework combining techniques from complexity science and operations research, aiming at reducing the impact of these situations and—if possible—avoiding them. The key elements of this framework are (i) the generation of early warning signals for out-of-control situations, (ii) isolating a specific region such that delay stops propagating, and (iii) the application of decentralized decision making, more suited for information-sparse out-of-control situations. © 2021, The Author(s).","Complexity science; Operations research; Railway disruption management; Rescheduling","Decision making; Operations research; Railroad transportation; Combining operations; Combining techniques; Complexity science; Decentralized decision making; Disruption management; Early warning; Out-of-control; Railway system; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100097360

Recent approaches based on the analysis of subsamples of the data suggest in fact that predictability where it occurs might exist only within so-called “pockets of predictability” rather than across the entire sample. However, these methods are prone to the criticism that the subsample dates are endogenously determined such that the use of standard critical values appropriate for full sample tests will result in incorrectly sized tests leading to spurious findings of stock returns predictability. To avoid the problem of endogenously-determined sample splits, we propose new tests derived from sequences of predictability statistics systematically calculated over subsamples of the data. Specifically, we will base tests on the maximum of such statistics from sequences of forward and backward recursive, rolling, and double-recursive predictive subsample regressions. We develop our approach using the over-identified instrumental variable-based predictability test statistics of Breitung and Demetrescu (2015). This approach is based on partial-sum asymptotics and so, unlike many other popular approaches including, for example, those based on Bonferroni corrections, can be readily adapted to implementation over sequences of subsamples. We show that the limiting null distributions of our proposed test statistics depend in general on whether the putative predictor is strongly or weakly persistent and on any heteroskedasticity present (indeed on any time-variation present in the unconditional variance matrix of the innovations), the latter even if the subsample statistics are based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. As a consequence, we develop fixed regressor wild bootstrap implementations of the tests which we demonstrate to be first-order asymptotically valid. Finite sample behaviour against a variety of temporarily predictable processes is considered. An empirical application to US stock returns illustrates the usefulness of the new predictability testing methods we propose. © 2020 The Author(s)","Conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity; Endogeneity; Persistence; Predictive regression; Rolling and recursive IV estimation","Financial markets; Investments; Sampling; Statistical tests; Bonferroni correction; Endogeneity; Forward-and-backward; Heteroskedasticity; Instrumental variables; Persistence; Predictive regression; Stock returns predictability; Statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079556243

Following the fundamental theoretical frameworks of motivation, the authors argue that remote work tasks and the environment highly determine employees' productivity and satisfaction, which in turn influence their intention to continue working from home once the restrictions are relaxed. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 363 remote work employees were collected, indicating their personal experiences of working from home during COVID-19 quarantine. The analyses were carried out using partial least squares–structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology, employing the SmartPLS3 software. Findings: The results reveal the possibility for reconciliation and the adequate remote work's flow as motivating, and the interruptions and technology-related anxiety as interfering impacts, in the process of achieving functional home office. However, although employees might be productive, it is not a sufficient condition for them to show an intention to continue working remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, contrary to their satisfaction, which is found crucial for their future intentions. Originality/value: The theoretical and practical implications of this study suggest several avenues for productive management of the transition to remote work, especially when the need is imposed urgently and an adequate selection of the most indispensable aspects for constructive working from home must be rapidly reached. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Dedication; Productivity; Remote work; Satisfaction; Telecommuting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109926364

Monthly natural gas consumption time series from 18 European countries are considered. A comparative, out-of-sample evaluation is conducted up to 12 steps (a year) ahead, using a comprehensive set of competing forecasting approaches. These range from statistical benchmarks to machine learning methods and state-of-the-art ensembles. Several performance (accuracy) metrics are used, and a sensitivity analysis is undertaken.

Digital channels enable reaching large audiences in a short period of time, and engaging consumers in message sharing activities to reap those rewards has its own challenges. Companies need to understand what increases sharing of their sustainability messages, but they must be mindful of not overstating their sustainability efforts which may be perceived as greenwashing. The Information Adoption Model is used to assess how message information quality and source credibility affect sharing of corporate sustainability messages. A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis is conducted on a survey of UK social media users (n = 527). Results show that dimensions of information quality and source credibility act in combination to influence sustainability message sharing.

Most notably the introduction of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard by the Object Management Group provides a suitable solution for externalising decisions from processes and automating decision enactments for processes. This article introduces a systematic way of tackling the separation of the decision modelling concern from process modelling by providing a Decision as a Service (DaaS) layered Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) which approaches decisions as automated and externalised services that processes need to invoke on demand to obtain the decision outcome. The DaaS mechanism is elucidated by a formalisation of DMN constructs and the relevant layer elements. Furthermore, DaaS is evaluated against the fundamental characteristics of the SOA paradigm, proving its contribution in terms of abstraction, reusability, loose coupling, and other pertinent SOA principles. Additionally, the benefits of the DaaS design on process-decision modelling and mining are discussed. Finally, the DaaS design is illustrated on a real-life event log of a bank loan application and approval process, and the SOA maturity of DaaS is assessed. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","decision mining; decision model and notation; Decision modelling; DMN; integrated mining; integrated modelling; process modelling; separation of concerns; service discovery; service-oriented architecture","Architecture; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information services; Process engineering; Separation; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Decision mining; Decision model and notation; Decision modeling; Integrated mining; Integrated modeling; Process-models; Separation of concerns; Service discovery; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); Reusability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128451001

This paper aims to synthesise research developments in the PR domain in order to provide an insightful picture of current research and explore future directions for the research community. To ensure research rigour, we adapt a six-step framework - defining the topic, searching databases, cleaning and clustering data, paper selection, content analysis, and discussion. A hybrid approach is adopted for clustering and identifying the distribution and themes in a large number of publications collected from academic databases. The hybrid approach combines machine learning topic modelling and bibliometric analysis. The machine learning results indicate that the overall research can be clustered into three groups: (1) operations management of PR, covering (re)manufacturing network design, product recovery, reverse distribution, and quality of cores; (2) retailer and (re)manufacturer issues including return policy, channel, inventory, pricing, and information strategies; and (3) customer's psychology, experience, and perception on marketing-operation interface. Furthermore, from the content analysis, five potential future directions are discussed, namely digitalisation in the context of PR; globalisation versus localisation in the context of PR; multi-layer (i.e., retailer, manufacturer, logistics provider, online platform) and multi-channel (i.e., online, offline, dual and omni channel) oriented bespoke return policy; understanding and predicting customer return behaviour via online footprints; and customer return perception across the marketing–operations interface. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometric analysis; Framework; Literature review; Machine learning; Product returns; Topic modelling","Electronic commerce; Industrial research; Information management; Machine learning; Product design; Quality control; Bibliometrics analysis; Content analysis; Framework; Hybrid approach; Literature reviews; Marketing-operations interfaces; Product returns; Return policy; Systematic literature review; Topic Modeling; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117717957

Therefore we propose and demonstrate a hierarchical model that selectively combines topics at varying levels of generality.

Each topic and branch are examined individually through a detailed examination of terms and keywords. Representative works and authors in each of the branches are also identified. The method enables the examination of the complex structure of knowledge in a scientific journal in a succinct representation.

A top-down approach is adopted to construct a financial proxy-based sentiment index completed with sentiment extracted from automobile news and customer reviews. The paper uses a text mining approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. The study was initially performed at the overall individual stock from the Nifty Auto NSE but focused on the top three passenger vehicle manufacturing companies i.e., Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher. It was found that the sentiment index was augmented with news and customer reviews allows predicting more accurately NIFTY AUTO stock price movements. This implies that customer sentiment is a major driver of investor sentiment which in turn impacts the stock market and the firm value.

The literature has offered only a partial understanding of this challenge due to the episodic focus on the digital delivery of individual projects or the initial adoption of digital practice in firms. Through a longitudinal ethnographic study of an engineering firm, this paper explored how practitioners act upon the surge of custom digital integration agendas across multiple projects. By looking at and beyond a large portfolio of projects that demanded building information modeling (BIM) cloud collaboration, this study found that disparate digital agendas across projects disrupt digital integration routines, and they have knock-on effects that can overreach project boundaries and impact projects portfolios and firm operations. With this evidence, this research spotlights the shifting loci of information integration in practice, wherein custom agendas pressure practitioners to shift the focus of integration from their permanent practice at firms to temporary workflows in projects. By revealing organizational responses to this phenomenon, this paper introduces the concept of genericity-complexity trade-off in digital integration routines to explain how firms generate routines that address integration either with ad hoc responses in projects or with systemized integrative efforts across all constellations of practice. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Building information modeling (BIM); Cloud collaboration; Digital integration; Engineering practice; Organizational routines","Economic and social effects; Information theory; Integration; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Cloud collaboration; Collaboration protocols; Digital integration; Engineering firms; Engineering practices; Ethnographic study; Initial adoption; Organisational routines; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116263644

The optimization of order picking planning is crucial to speed up customers’ delivery process and reduce warehouse expenses. A commonly adopted strategy is called mixed-shelves storage strategy (MSSS) that is highly recommended for e-commerce warehouses. Applying this, the units of the same stock keeping unit (SKU) are scattered to various storage locations which provides more improvement room for OP. However, consolidated methods have not been sufficiently discussed when OP is under the MSSS. In this paper, we study the problem of wave picking systems to jointly address order batching, batch assignment, and picker routing (BAR) in a MSSS-based warehouse. We propose the decomposition of OP into BAR subproblems (DOPBAR) for solving such a wave OP problem. We examine our approach on a large set of instances, validate the effectiveness of our method, and point out the advantages of the MSSS in OP. Moreover, we analyze the trade-offs between two conflicting objectives that practitioners aim to optimize: customer service level (makespan) and workforce level (labor cost).

This is difficult: Regulatory changes made in Nevada in 2015 to protect Nevada's utility induced SolarCity, the market leader in solar systems, to suspend local operations. We show that the choice of utility tariff structure is crucial to achieving socially desirable objectives. Academic/practical relevance: It is important for regulators to understand how tariff structure interacts with social objectives. This has implications for consumers, regulators, and industry. Methodology: We use a sequential game to analyze the regulator's social welfare maximization problem in a market with a regulated utility; an unregulated, price-setting, profit-maximizing solar system installer; and customers who endogenously determine whether to adopt solar or not, based on utility tariffs, solar prices, and their heterogeneous usage profiles and generation potentials. Results: We illustrate that the effectiveness of tariff structures is not governed simply by the number of free tariff parameters, but by the functions these parameters serve. In particular, an effective tariff must discriminate among customer usage tiers and between customers with and without rooftop solar to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We present a tariff structure with these two characteristics and show how it can be implemented as a simple buy-all, sell-all tariff while retaining its favorable properties. We illustrate our findings numerically using data from Nevada and New Mexico, two states grappling with this issue. Managerial implications: Many utilities in the United States operate tariff structures that are missing at least one of the two identified features. Regulators must overhaul these tariff structures to adequately safeguard all stakeholders.

This means that efficiency measures and targets are obtained based on farthest distance projections. However, when the decision making units (DMUs) operate at less than the efficient scale, such modelling approach can be very restrictive. This paper proposes a minimum distance Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model in order to evaluate the efficiency of Japanese banking sector over the period 2013–2019. The proposed model is based on Koopmans notion of strong efficiency. When comparing our findings from the minimum distance slack inefficiency model with those against the traditional slack inefficiency model, we find significant differences. These differences are primarily based on the way the benchmark targets have been set in the two methodological frameworks. Finally our finding brings forward the importance and the implications on bank efficiency measurement, when non-feasible targets are set during the bank efficiency evaluation. © Operational Research Society 2021.","banks; benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; minimum/shortest/least distance inefficiency; slack inefficiency","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Banking sectors; Decision making unit; Efficiency evaluation; Efficiency measure; Efficiency measurement; Methodological frameworks; Minimum distance; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109042552

Yet, it tends to be explained almost exclusively in terms of intrapersonal predictors, such as the sunk cost fallacy. This paper examines whether, how, and under which conditions interpersonal influence, such as the intensity of a team’s recommendation to persist with a losing project, encourages entrepreneurs to persist. Drawing from the psychologies of escalation and self-regulation, we build a model of entrepreneurs’ undue persistence that we test through experimental design and conjoint analysis. We find that an entrepreneur’s decision to persist with a losing project is determined partly by the team’s recommendation to persist and that the strength of this effect varies across entrepreneurs based on their self-regulation and experience. © The Author(s) 2021.","conjoint analysis; decision making; escalation of commitment; experiment; persistence; self-regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117147717

Unstructured problems, such as the grand challenges, are characterised by the existence of multiple actors with different perspectives and conflicting interests, and they require a coordinated effort from multiple organisations. Within this context, this paper aims to understand stakeholders’ perceptions of system boundaries and problem framings, and their potential effects on decision-making by systematically comparing different stakeholder groups’ causal maps around the same shared concern. Bridging notions from Operational Research, System Dynamics and Organisational Studies, the comparison is based on a novel type of thematic analysis of Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) built with each stakeholder group on their perceptions of a given system. The proposed integrated approach combines qualitative with quantitative analysis, such as the centrality of the variables and the structure of the CLDs. Such CLDs comparison provides an intuitive way to visualise differences and similarities of the thematic clusters of variables, underlining factors influencing the shared concern. This could be considered a starting point for more shared understanding as well as more integrated holistic perceptions of the system and, consequently, a more systemic decision-making. Furthermore, for the sake of replicability, this paper also presents a qualitative participatory System Dynamics modelling process aimed to define the key aspects of a problem for each group of stakeholders to support a collaborative multi-organisational decision-making process.

This article thus extends the KSTE to the firm level by directly investigating the effects of knowledge filters on knowledge spillovers (employee venturing behaviors) in incumbent firms. Moreover, based on the KSTE and institutional theory, we examine how regulatory institution (government support) and the enforceability of it (government transparency) moderate the effect of knowledge filters in incumbent firms on their employee venturing behaviors. We collect survey data from the Chinese pharmaceutical industry as it is knowledge intensive and entrepreneurially active by using a multi-informant method, that is, two senior managers from every responding company were interviewed on site by using structured questionnaires. To further minimize bias, we combine the survey data with provincial secondary data to test research hypotheses. Our findings reveal that the positive link between incumbent firms' knowledge filters and employee venturing behaviors is enhanced by government policy support and government tax support. Furthermore, government transparency strengthens the moderating effect of government policy support whereas it weakens the moderating role of government tax support on the link between knowledge filters and employee venturing behaviors. Overall, this article explores the key proposition of the KSTE framework at the firm level, thus constructing the microfoundation of the KSTE, and substantiates the importance of integrating regulatory institutions into the firm-level KSTE. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Employee venturing behavior; government policy support (GPS); government tax support (GTS); government transparency; knowledge filter","Bandpass filters; Economic and social effects; Public policy; Surveys; Taxation; Employee venturing behavior; Firm-level analysis; Government policy support; Government tax support; Government transparency; Knowledge filter; Knowledge spillover theory; Knowledge spillovers; Policy support; Survey data; Transparency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118450422

Finally, we analyze the computational results and show that early trigger social distancing strategies result in smaller death tolls; however, there are relatively larger second waves. Conversely, late trigger social distancing strategies result in higher initial death tolls but relatively smaller second waves. This study shows that decision analytic tools can help policy makers simulate different social distancing scenarios at the early stages of a global outbreak.

We consider two competing dual-channel retailers, and investigate conditions under which it is optimal for one or both of the retailers to offer the BORS strategy. We first assume that a partial refund is offered for online returns and then consider the important case of a full refund. We show that whether both retailers adopt this strategy significantly depends on the return rate and cross-selling profit. Specifically, if the return rate is sufficiently low (high), at least one retailer (both retailers) will adopt this strategy when the unit cross-selling profit is relatively high. Nonetheless, both retailers will fall into the prisoner's dilemma under certain conditions. Interestingly, the return rate and proportion of consumers with a high hassle cost associated with BORS returns significantly influence the equilibrium channel strategy and the existence of the prisoner's dilemma. We further find that, when both retailers implement the BORS strategy, they both benefit from offering a full refund return policy when the number of online-type consumers is large enough and the unit cross-selling profit is relatively small, but should provide a partial refund otherwise. When only one retailer adopts the BORS strategy, a partial refund return policy is preferable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Buy online and return to store; Competition; Cross-channel return strategy; Dual-channel retailer; Supply chain management","Commerce; Game theory; Sales; Supply chain management; Buy online and return to store; Competitive markets; Condition; Cross-channel return strategy; Cross-selling; Dual channel; Dual-channel retailer; Low-high; Prisoners' Dilemma; Return policy; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121436072

These omissions have led to calls for a causally adjacent theory of EO. Grounded in knowledge-based theory, we investigated (a) how knowledge production gives rise to EO, (b) how the relationship between EO and profitability is mediated by knowledge use, and (c) how this relationship between EO and knowledge use is moderated by stakeholder engagement. Using multirespondent, multisource data from small-size and mid-size enterprises in two economically distinct East Asian countries, Taiwan and Japan, empirical evidence supports our theory. Our findings are consistent across both studies. We contribute a knowledge-based theory of EO. Managerial Summary: Why do some firms organize to be entrepreneurial while others do not, and why do some entrepreneurially oriented firms profit more financially than others? We find that those firms that organize processes to accumulate, aggregate, activate, store, manage, and distribute knowledge become more entrepreneurial oriented as the means to create wealth from this “knowledge production.” In other words, knowledge production can affect perceptions of opportunities and resources, leading to choices about organizational arrangements to best use knowledge. However, we find that the firm also needs to be adept at knowledge use to profit financially from its entrepreneurial endeavors, and leading firms utilize stakeholder engagement to strengthen the relationship between entrepreneurial behavior and knowledge use on the route to greater profitability. © 2021 Strategic Management Society.","empowered organizational members; entrepreneurial orientation; knowledge; knowledge production; knowledge use; knowledge-based theory; performance; profitability; SMEs; stakeholder engagement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114112037

This is while, smart demand response programming (DRP) is considered as the bridge between these two indicators of smart grid. Moreover, the subtle point of proliferating P2P schematics is the regulation towards the maximization of social welfare leading to economic profitability of customers and owner's of microgrid and, eventually, reduction of pollutant emission of fossil fuels. Also, uncertainty, aroused by electrical consumption and renewable energy resources, is the core of every considerations, which has to be dealt with intelligent algorithms for strengthening the stability of transactions. On the other hand, compatibility with upper grid's regulations, i.e. power loss and voltage deviation, along with determining fair price of energy trading are the subjects of P2P-based tactics. Therefore, this paper proposes a P2P-based transactive energy sharing architecture, as two stage mixed integer non-linear programming, using smart DRP integrated with machine learning approach, i.e. radial basis neural network. Firstly, the uncertainty of electrical demand and renewable energies are relaxed through short term forecasting. Doing so, the day-ahead transactions of peers are obtained based on their energy management objective, targeting the energy reliability of customers, which energy not supplied criterion has to be equal to zero. Then, participation of customers in DRP, cost of customers, revenue of microgrid's owner and transactions of real time programming are optimally acquired based on Pareto front technique. Also, the simulations are conducted on IEEE 85 bus test system to realize the considerations.

This trajectory charts a technology's evolution and is among the best-supporting data for decision making. Technology life cycle (TLC) analysis, as one of the foundational topics in the field of technology management, is of vital importance for describing the evolutionary path of technology. However, most current methods simply rely on static patent indicators, which neglect the dynamic aspects of a technology's development. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework of diverse characteristics and novel procedures for identifying the entire span of a technology's life cycle from a series of patent citation networks. After retrieving patent data with a well-defined search strategy, a sequence of patent citation networks is constructed year by year. Network attribute indicators are then calculated for each of the networks and used to inform an evolution model, which reveals the TLC. To illustrate the strengths and potential of this approach, we have taken additive manufacturing technology as an example for analysis. Through the framework, we are able to demonstrate the technology at various stages of its maturity and how it has changed over time, along with some areas of competitive advantage and promising future opportunities. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Patent citation network; S-shape; Technology evolution; Technology life cycle","Additives; Competition; Decision making; Life cycle; Patents and inventions; Certain rule; Decisions makings; Life cycle analysis; Management IS; Patent citation networks; S shape; Technology development; Technology evolution; Technology life cycle; Technology trajectory; 3D printers; competitiveness; intellectual property rights; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131409284

However, not all FDI leads to inclusive economic growth, lifting the welfare of the poorest groups. This paper examines the conditions under which FDI can effectively lead to inclusive growth. By using a fixed effects regression with annual data for 67 countries from 1990 to 2015, we find that FDI has a positive effect on inclusive growth when there is a sufficiently large manufacturing sector and infrastructure base in the host country. We also indirectly find that FDI has a positive effect on inclusive growth when the host country has a large service sector. These not very optimistic results emphasise the critical importance of the host country's absorptive capacity. A smaller technological or knowledge gap with the foreign firms is required for FDI to lead to more linkages and spillovers and ultimately job creation for the poor. The results cast doubt on development strategies that rely on FDI as a sufficient policy for inclusive growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","FDI; inclusive growth; infrastructure; manufacturing; structural change","development strategy; economic development; economic growth; economic impact; foreign direct investment; manufacturing; policy approach; spillover effect; structural change; welfare economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121574238

While empirical research on remanufacturing has gained the attention of scholars, the crucial aspects of customer decision making – that is, determinants of customers' emotions and how they affect their purchasing decisions – have been neglected. Unlike most of the previous studies, which have used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explain environmental behaviours, this study used Stimulus Organism Response theory to explain purchase intention towards remanufactured products. Furthermore, the study extends the literature by investigating the impacts of environmental consciousness, government interference, sellers’ reputation, perceived environmental benefit, perceived knowledge, and perceived risk on intention to purchase remanufactured products through subjective norms, attitudes, and perceived behavioural control. A total of 253 useable data were collected and analysed using Partial Least Squares (PLS), as a symmetric analysis technique, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), as an asymmetric technique. The findings from PLS found that subjective norms and perceived knowledge have non-significant effects on intention to purchase and attitude respectively. However, the findings from fsQCA showed that all factors play a role in shaping the intention to purchase remanufactured products and identified more heterogeneous combinations of stimuli and emotions to predict purchase intentions. Besides theoretical contributions, the study has numerous practical implications for government agencies and industry players aiming to enhance customer intention to purchase remanufactured products. © 2022","Behaviour; Determinants; Intention to purchase; Remanufactured products; Sustainability; Sustainable manufacturing","Decision making; Least squares approximations; Purchasing; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Behavior; Circular economy; Closed-loop; Determinant; Intention to purchase; Partial least-squares; Purchase intention; Remanufactured products; Subjective norm; Sustainable manufacturing; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130334597

However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is “Technical Characteristics”, and the top three sub-enablers are: “blockchain smart contract”, “blockchain security,” and “tracking product components”, respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT. As far as we know, this paper is one of the first studies to evaluate blockchain's enablers for SSCT, especially in the context of African emerging economies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Best worst method; Blockchain; Supply chain; Sustainability; Transparency","Agriculture; Blockchain; Decision making; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Transparency; Agricultural supply chains; BAD methods; Best bad method; Block-chain; Complex decision; Decision-making problem; Environmental performance; Social responsibilities; Sustainable supply chains; Technology organization environments; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129387752

The oil and gas industry uses state-of-the-art engineering solutions for oil and gas exploration but substantially lags behind in using innovative digital technologies that can improve operational excellence. This study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for assessing blockchain adoption strategies. The framework builds on critical factors for blockchain adoption and four adoption strategies — single use, localization, substitution, and transformation. Data were collected from ten experts in the Norwegian oil and gas industry using a structured web survey. The Bayesian Best Worst Method (BWM), a probabilistic MCDM method, was used for analysis. The results suggest that three sub-criteria, which are lack of expertise about technology, lack of supply chain partner collaboration, and reducing operation cost, have the most impact on the adoption process. As for blockchain adoption alternatives, the fourth phase, that is, transformation, is the most preferred in the context of the Norwegian oil and gas industry. The proposed framework lays the foundation for companies to understand the critical elements that need improvement to accelerate the blockchain technology adoption process. © 2022 The Author(s)","Best-worst method; Blockchain; Multi-criteria decision-making; Oil and gas; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; Decision making; Gas industry; Gases; Petroleum prospecting; Supply chains; BAD methods; Bayesian; Best-bad method; Block-chain; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Oil and gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Technology adoption; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129581005

We then demonstrate how this industry's decision-makers can plan for pathways while navigating obstacles and opportunities to an uncertain future. Finally, we identify four scenarios providing plausible pathways to a future that is different from business as usual and able to generate trillions of dollars of value across industries.

Then we conduct a comprehensive survey on existing works from four aspects, i.e., computation scheduling, information perception, energy-saving, and security. Finally, we point out several future research directions worth our attention. We believe that wearable devices enhanced with edge computing technologies would bring more benefits and convenience to our life shortly. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Computation scheduling; Edge computing; Energy-saving; Wearable technology","Edge computing; Energy conservation; Surveys; Compact size; Computation scheduling; Computing technology; Device resources; Future research directions; Information perception; Smart wearables; Wearable devices; Wearable technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110181566

We aimed to assess the sustainability of corn (Zea mays) production using four tillage systems which varied in the intensity of soil disturbance (i.e., conventional till with moldboard plow (MP), conventional till with chisel plow (CP), strip-tillage (ST), and no-till (NT)) by performing life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis and Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA). It is common that material and energy wastage is not considered in sustainability assessment studies. When material and energy wastes are calculated in monetary terms, the hidden costs of production will be revealed. Simultaneous application of LCA and MFCA methods in sustainability assessments can provide such valuable information. Cradle-to-farm gate was considered as the system boundary in LCA-MFCA. The total annual energy input for corn production using MP, CP, ST, and NT was found to be 37472 MJ ha−1 (3092 MJ t−1), 36384 MJ ha−1 (3290 MJ t−1), 33717 MJ ha−1 (3309 MJ t−1), and 32889 MJ ha−1 (2764 MJ t−1), respectively. As energy demand increased, yield per ha also increased in all tillage systems except in NT in which yield increase was concurrent with improved energy efficiency. The gross value was calculated as 1470 $ ha−1 (121 $ t−1) for MP, 1446 $ ha−1 (131 $ t−1) for CP, 1380 $ ha−1 (128 $ t−1) for ST, and 1334 $ ha−1 (112 $ t−1) for NT system. The economic indices for each tillage system were computed. Our results showed that eliminating those negative products in corn production can increase farmers' net benefit by 200 $ ha−1. Global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, and photochemical ozone creation were selected to reflect the environmental impact associated with corn production in each tillage system. From an environmental standpoint, NT and MP performed much better than CP and ST. In three important impact categories (i.e., global warming potential, acidification, and eutrophication potential) MP, and in the other two impact categories (i.e., photochemical ozone creation potential and ozone depletion potential) NT system performed best among all tillage systems. It can be concluded that NT showed the best performance in terms of energy, economic and environmental indicators for corn production followed by MP system. © 2022","Economic productivity; Energy use efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle assessment; Material flow cost accounting; No-tillage","Acidification; Agriculture; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Ozone; Ozone layer; Productivity; Sustainable development; Corn production; Economic productivity; Energy-use efficiency; Flow costs; Greenhouses gas; Material Flow; Material flow cost accounting; Moldboard plows; No tillage; No-till; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127183857

Here we present the results of a systematic literature review identifying the ways in which digital technologies have been applied in the oil and gas, mining, and energy domains. We applied content and descriptive analysis to evaluate and discuss 151 academic articles selected from the Scopus database. Two particularly interesting trends emerge from the analysis. First, over 75% of the papers were about the energy sector excluding the oil & gas industry, and only a small minority were from the mining or oil & gas sectors. Second, the most frequently discussed objective of digital transformation was the reduction of operational expenses. By surveying the different ways in which these innovations have been used in these industries and identifying trends and patterns in how digital technologies have been applied, the findings of this review deepen our understanding of the current state of digital technologies within the resource and energy sectors and, in so doing, shine a useful amount of light on the contributions that digital transformation has made to businesses in these sectors. This paper also highlights for future scholars, practitioners, and policymakers the six research areas that they should focus on in the future to help the resource and energy sectors accelerate the digital transformation process and improve their ability to deliver value with these innovations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital technologies; Digitalization; Energy; Mining; Oil and gas; Resource sector","Economics; Gas industry; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Digitalization; Economic growths; Energy; Energy sector; Oil and gas; Potential benefits; Resource sector; Systematic Review; Energy resources; energy market; energy use; innovation; literature review; mining; oil industry; resource development; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125541477

Therefore, understanding the future mineral price movement is critical for revenue-based planning both for the company and the country. In this article, the Autoregressive Distribution Lag (ARDL) model was used to forecast annual gold prices using gold demand, treasury bills rates, and lagged gold prices as covariates. Augmented Dickey Fuller and the Phillips Perron methods were used to test for unit roots and found that all the variables were integrated of order one. Subsequently, the cointegration test was undertaken, which indicated that there is no cointegration between the variables. This entailed application of the short-run version of the ARDL to forecasts and consequent analysis. A Granger causality analysis show that gold demand Granger causes gold price; and that treasury bill rates do not Granger cause gold price. Lastly, the ARDL (4, 4, 2) model, which provides best ARDL forecast results, was evaluated against two other forecasting methods namely stochastic mean reverting, and Autoregressive Integrate Moving Average (ARIMA). Results showed that the ARDL model emerged as a best of all the three forecasting methods to forecast annual gold prices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,"Costs; Economics; Investments; Mineral resources; Minerals; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Auto-regressive; Commodity prices; Forecasting methods; Gold demand; Gold prices; Investment decisions; Lag model; Mineral investment; Price forecasting; Stochastic-modeling; Forecasting; decision making; gold; Granger causality test; investment; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123032567

Strategy literature argues that integration enhances the firm's appropriation of returns from innovations. We evaluate this argument recognizing that integration is but one of multiple appropriation tools; firms can also use other (e.g., scale-based) mechanisms to enhance appropriation. Using new measures of integration based on textual coding of patent claims, we demonstrate that while higher process–product integration improves firm performance, this effect diminishes when the firm has greater production capacity or access to markets. Further, high integration lowers innovative productivity. Together, these demonstrations explain why firms, even with awareness of the benefits of integration between components, may not all choose high-integration strategies. Managerial Summary: How should a manager design, structure, and organize the firm's innovation portfolio—as a collection of separate standalone process and product innovations, or a set of innovations each containing both new process and product attributes? Using data from the global chemicals industry and new textual-coding-based measures, we demonstrate that the latter helps the firm appropriate returns to its innovations by making it harder for others to understand and replicate its innovations, but that it comes with a tradeoff of lower innovative productivity. We stress that latter approach is less useful when the firm has other scale-based tools in place, that enhance appropriation as well, such as large production capacity or reach to markets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","appropriability; innovation; interdependence; process; product","Integration; Managers; Patents and inventions; Product design; Appropriability; Firm innovation; Higher integration; Innovation; Interdependence; Patent claims; Process; Process products; Product; Production capacity; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118133846

In particular, the present analysis examines the impact of centralisation versus decentralisation of responsibilities across levels of government, making use of newly collected data on governance and expenditure assignment, as well as non-linear empirical specifications. An interlocking U-shaped relationship is found with respect to expenditure and life expectancy. Under moderate decentralisation, public spending in health care is lower, while life expectancy is higher, compared with more centralised systems; however, in highly decentralised systems, public spending is higher and life expectancy is lower. This finding of a “fish-shaped” relationship for decentralisation and outcomes also helps to understand recent reforms of OECD health systems, which have often reverted towards more moderate degrees of administrative decentralisation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Governance; Health care; Intergovernmental fiscal relations; Public economics","article; centralization; controlled study; decision making; economics; fish; government; health care system; life expectancy; nonhuman; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; responsibility; health care cost; health care delivery; human; politics; Delivery of Health Care; Health Expenditures; Humans; Politics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117617090

Due to the nonlinearity in stock data, a model developed using the traditional or a single intelligent technique may not accurately forecast results. Therefore, there is a need to develop a hybridization of intelligent techniques for an effective predictive model. In this study, we propose an intelligent forecasting method based on a hybrid of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and uses two US stock market indices, DOW30 and NASDAQ100, for forecasting. The data were partitioned into training, testing, and validation datasets. The model validation was done on the stock data of the COVID-19 period. The experimental findings obtained using the DOW30 and NASDAQ100 reveal that the accuracy of the GA and ANN hybrid model for the DOW30 and NASDAQ100 is greater than that of the single ANN (BPANN) technique, both in the short and long term. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Artificial neural networks (ANN); Back propagation neural network (BPANN); Genetic algorithms (GA); Stock market forecasting","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Fintech; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Predictive analytics; Artificial intelligence techniques; Hybrid model; Intelligent forecasting; Intelligent techniques; Model validation; Predictive modeling; Stock market forecasting; Stock market index; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112581991

Despite the urgency with which the app was developed, a clear commitment was made to designing the technology in a way that enshrined key ethical principles, and an ethics advisory board (EAB) was established to provide timely advice, guidance and recommendations on associated ethical issues. Alongside this, there were extensive criticisms of how NHSX adhered to ethical principles in the handling of the app development-criticisms that require empirical exploration. This paper explores how ethics was incorporated into decision-making during governance processes associated with the development of app. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with those involved in the app's development/governance, those with a consulting role associated with the app, or those who sat on the EAB. Findings: The EAB fulfilled an important role by introducing ethical considerations to app developers. Though at times, it was difficult to accommodate key ethics principles into governance processes, which sometimes suffered from little accountability. Originality/value: While several articles have provided overviews of ethical issues, or explored public perceptions towards contact tracing apps, to the best the authors, knowledge this is the first empirical piece analysing ethics governance issues via stakeholder interviews. © 2021, Gabrielle Samuel and Federica Lucivero.","Contact tracing app; Digital health; Ethics; Governance; NHSX; Pandemic; Preparedness; RRI","Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; defecation; ethics; human; mobile application; pandemic; perception; politics; qualitative research; telecommunication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119875126

First, we analyze the equilibrium outcomes when the buyer simultaneously or sequentially bilaterally negotiates with the suppliers. We establish coordination results and characterize the buyer’s maximum equilibrium profit under such bilateral bargaining settings. Moreover, we show that the buyer can benefit from a request for proposal/quotation (RFx) stage that precedes the negotiation stage when the suppliers are imperfect substitutes. Specifically, by endogenizing the sequence of negotiations via the offers tendered in the RFx stage, the buyer’s equilibrium profit with an RFx is (weakly) higher than his or her maximum equilibrium profit without an RFx. Furthermore, under a complete information setting, the buyer accepts both offers generated in the RFx stage and additional negotiation needs not to be carried out in equilibrium. Our insights extend to a random demand setting, in which the buyer first negotiates contracts with the suppliers and then decides order quantities after demand realization.

We analyze shipment policies (i.e., the rules to determine the quantity and age composition of inventory to ship from a warehouse to a retail location) and their impact on profits and waste. Academic/practical relevance: The same firm often bears the cost of expiration at the warehouse and the retail store, which is why the problem necessitates a supply chain perspective. The ship oldest first (SOF) policy (commonly referred to as first in, first out) is advocated by industry experts to manage product shelf lives. Although its optimality in a single location is well established in the literature, it has not been studied in the context of a two-stage supply chain. Methodology: We conduct empirical analysis on a real-life data set to motivate the relevance of our problem. Then, we formulate an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem with stochastic demand for which we obtain analytical and numerical results. Results: The SOF policy is found to always minimize waste at the warehouse and total waste (warehouse and retail level combined) and under certain practically unlikely conditions, to maximize profits. However, in most practical applications, it is suboptimal, and the optimal policy is shown to have a complex structure. We analyze deterministic and myopic versions of our problem in order to generate insights on the trade-off between the issuing cost and the expiration cost. Then, we develop heuristic policies based on the myopic analysis of the problem, which are shown to perform well in terms of profits, waste, and product freshness; in our numerical analysis, the best such heuristic yields a median optimality gap of 9.5% versus 21% for SOF, pantry life of 69% versus 56% for SOF, and retail waste of 4% versus 10% for SOF. Managerial implications: The SOF policy is shown to generate high waste at the retail store, where waste is more likely to be disposed of at landfills as opposed to being donated; therefore, it may have an adverse impact on the environment. Our results also show that it is not effective at managing shelf lives in the supply chain, contrary to what practitioners argue, as evidenced by poor pantry life leading to excessive waste at the household level. Our analysis also questions the value of flow-through stocking systems to facilitate SOF as we show that firms can gain much more from improving their issuing policies. © 2021 INFORMS","consumer packaged goods; dynamic programming; food waste; inventory issuing; perishable inventory; practice-driven research; shipment policy; two echelon; warehousing","Dynamic programming; Economic and social effects; Land fill; Managers; Sales; Ships; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Warehouses; Consumer packaged goods; Food waste; Inventory issuing; Optimality; Perishable inventory; Practice-driven research; Shelf life; Shipment policy; Two echela; Warehousing; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132215088

In this paper, we conceptually bridge the literature on projects and M&As to discuss the transitory nature of organisations by mobilising the concepts of project, programme, and portfolio as alternative modes of organising M&As. As a project, the managerial effort in M&A focuses on completion on time and budget. As a programme, M&As are managed as complex processes of convergence between organisations. As a portfolio, M&A management is part of the ongoing integration efforts within organisations that have grown via M&As.

In the scenario of a pandemic or other disruptions, the role of logistics becomes even more important. Digitalisation of logistics and the supply chain is seen as an important tool for logistics resilience in such situations, but for developing countries digitalisation poses certain challenges. This study identifies barriers to innovative digitalisation technology that hinder the digital elevation of supply chain logistics during a pandemic. Strategies to deal with and overcome these barriers are proposed. The multi-criteria decision analysis method (Bayesian best-worst method) is used to prioritise such barriers within the context of the Indian logistics sector of manufacturing organisations. The strategies are also prioritised according to their impact on the barriers, for which the additive value function is used. The results show that “high cost of investment”, “lack of monetary resources”, “inadequate internet connectivity”, “lack of IT (Information Technology) infrastructure” and “unclear economic benefit of digital investment” are the top five barriers to implementing innovative digitalisation technologies in developing countries like India, during a pandemic situation. The findings reveal an insight into digitalisation barriers during a pandemic that can be of value to managers and researchers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian best-worst method; COVID-19; Logistics; Pandemic; Resilience","Investments; Supply chains; BAD methods; Bayesian; Bayesian best-bad method; COVID-19; Crucial functions; Digital elevation; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Pandemic; Resilience; Supply chain logistics; Developing countries; Bayesian analysis; COVID-19; developing world; digitization; epidemic; information and communication technology; logistics; pandemic; strategic approach; supply chain management; technological development; technology adoption; transportation infrastructure; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127105101

Increasing integration into global value chains (GVCs) is an inevitable trend for countries to develop their international markets. However, the dynamic relationships between GVC participation, CO2emissions, and economic growth have not been fully clarified. This study analyzes these relationships and the underlying mechanisms using a panel vector autoregressive model approach with data for 63 countries and regions from 2005 to 2015. The major findings are: (1) GVC participation promotes environmentally-friendly growth in the long run by increasing per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and reducing per capita CO2 emissions. (2) GVC participation increases as per capita CO2 emissions increase; it decreases as per capita GDP grows. (3) These relationships vary by industry and income. The variation of GVC participation in high-CO2 emission industries explains a large proportion of the variation in per capita CO2emissions, and in high value-added industries, GVC variation explains a large proportion of the variation in per capita GDP. Further, high-income countries benefit more from GVC participation compared to low-income countries. An important policy recommendation is that countries should actively participate in GVCs to promote sustainable growth. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emission; economic growth; global value chain participation; global warming; panel vector autoregressive model; sustainable growth","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; International trade; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; CO 2 emission; Economic growths; Emission growth; Global value chain; Global value chain participation; Gross domestic products; Panel vector autoregressive model; Per capita; Sustainable growth; Vector autoregressive model; Global warming; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; regional economy; sustainability; vector autoregression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126913149

Using 18,125 firm-year observations of Chinese firms from 2007 to 2016, we reveal a three-way interactive effect of cash holding, political ties, and the anti-corruption policy on innovation. Before the policy is implemented, cash holding has the greatest positive effect on R&D investment for politically connected firms, and after the implementation this positive effect for these firms is strongest for R&D outcomes. We propose that the logic of resource utilization efficiency implied by the anti-corruption policy strongly motivates politically connected firms to convert their R&D investment into actual output.

The industrial sales force assumes an important role in the selling of these complex service innovations. For firms a key challenge in this respect resides in ensuring the sales force's motivation for the selling of such innovations and effectively solving customers’ business problems. Past research frequently discussed monetary sales incentives as an effective tool to reinforce desired employee behaviors, but, to date, the discussion has failed to produce conclusive guidance for practitioners as to whether monetary sales incentives in fact can facilitate selling of complex service innovations. To clarify the effects of monetary sales incentives in this respect, we draw on self-focus theory to disentangle how complex service innovation selling is shaped by the interplay of salesperson service incentives (i.e., the extent to which variable compensation depends on service turnover) and salesperson share of variable compensation (i.e., the percentage of compensation that depends on performance). To test these interactive effects, we use a multiple-source data set including 294 salespeople, and match objective firm data. The results reveal that when service incentives are high, the share of variable compensation exhibits an inverse u-shaped effect on a salesperson's problem-solving behavior, which is an important predictor of innovative service selling success. In addition, the share of variable compensation increases work effort, which in turn drives innovative service selling success. These findings shed light on the intricate “human”, employee-related side of service innovation management and provide actionable implications for managers how to increase their firms’ innovative service selling success. © 2021 The Authors.

In this regard, green buildings are considered as solutions to slow global warming. Many challenges exist in delivering green building solutions, determining appropriate building information modelling (BIM) execution strategies, and standardising information exchange. This study aims to improve green assessments in buildings using digital technology. It investigates the challenges in environmental assessment method’s (EAM) workflow by integrating the EAM requirements in the design and construction project stages using the BIM platform. By applying a mixed-method approach, this study maps exciting EAM environmental credits against the BIM platform and Royal Institute of British Architects digital plan of works for construction projects. This is achieved through the analysis of qualitative data collected during interviews with architects, BIM experts, and environmental assessors in the UK. The results are used to propose a decision support framework using a BIM tool kit to ensure efficient project and data handling and delivery. This research addresses the elements of successful integration by investigating the factors affecting the use of performance analysis and integrating sustainability aspects within the digital plan of work. The results indicate that sustainability will take a more important role in the digitalisation of the construction sector if integrated within BIM frameworks. Furthermore, an effective decision making framework aids in addressing the sustainability targets and mitigating the negative impacts of the construction sector. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Digital plan of work; Environmental assessment method; Green buildings; Information exchange; Performance analysis","carbon dioxide; decision making; environmental assessment; green economy; integrated approach; performance assessment; sustainability; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112610273

A general predictor like factorization machine (FM) can efficiently capture non-linear interactions among patient characteristics for readmission prediction. However, FM cannot formulate local patient heterogeneity that commonly exists due to different demographics and hospitalization characteristics. This study proposes a locally weighted factorization machine (WFM) by developing a locally weighting scheme that assigns differentiated weights for training instances in accordance with their local similarities with high-readmission-risk ones. Io account for global heterogeneity among patient groups, we further extend WFM and propose a fuzzy partition enhanced WFM model (i.e., WFMFP), which (I) splits the dataset into multiple training subsets with fuzzy partition approach, (II) fits the WFM model on the basis of each training subset, and (III) combines the sub-prediction WFM models by using Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy weighting mechanism. We collected a territory-wide cohort with electronic health records in Hong Kong during 2008 to 2017. We demonstrated that the proposed WFMFP model outperforms several baselines, including standard FM, XGBoost, Lightgbm, Catboost, Gradient boosting machine, random forests, SVMs with different kernels, and multilayer perceptron. Comparative analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the locally weighting notion into FM to improve readmission prediction for clinical resource management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy partition; Healthcare; Locally weighting; Machine learning; Readmission prediction","Decision trees; Factorization; Frequency modulation; Health care; Random forests; Support vector machines; Aging societies; Factorization machines; Fuzzy partition; Healthcare services; Hong-kong; Locally weighting; Machine modelling; Nonlinear interactions; Readmission prediction; Training subsets; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124629812

In this manuscript, we examine whether coupling economic incentives with motivational tools provided by health wearables can address this limitation and drive longer-term changes in health behavior. We focus on “gain-loss” incentive schemes that offer both an economic reward for goal attainment and a penalty for failure to meet a goal. In an experiment conducted on individuals wearing Fitbit wearables, we find that gain-loss incentives can drive increases in physical activity but are limited by the element of choice. Specifically, we find modest and short-lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of gain-loss incentives. The subpar benefits for this group seem to emerge because those who benefit most from these schemes do not opt into them when they are voluntary. In contrast, we find significant and persistent increases in physical activity for those assigned (oftentimes against their preference) to the same gain-loss incentives. These individuals recorded ~2,000 additional steps daily during the incentive period, and benefits persisted for six months after incentives ended. Critically, the persistent gains to this group were driven by individuals who also utilized the wearable’s goal-setting tool.

This work has established that people often egocentrically discount advice. If they were to place more weight on advice, their point estimates would be more accurate. Yet the focus on point estimates and accuracy has resulted in a narrow conception of what it means to heed advice. We distinguish between revisions of point estimates and revisions of attendant probability distributions. Point estimates represent a single best guess; distributions represent the probabilities that people assign to all possible answers. A more complete picture of advice taking is provided by considering revisions of distributions, which reflect changes in both confidence and best guesses. We capture this using a new measure of advice utilization: the influence of advice. We observe that, when input from a high-quality advisor largely agrees with a person’s initial opinion, it engenders little change in one’s point estimate and, hence, little change in accuracy yet significantly increases confidence. This pattern suggests more advice taking than generally suspected. However, it is not necessarily beneficial. Because people are typically overconfident to begin with, receiving advice that agrees with their initial opinion can exacerbate overconfidence. In several experiments, we manipulate advisor quality and measure the extent to which advice agrees with a person’s initial opinion. The results allow us to pinpoint circumstances in which heeding advice is beneficial, improving accuracy or reducing overconfidence, as well as circumstances in which it is harmful, hurting accuracy or exacerbating overconfidence.

Online innovation communities (OICs), one representative of such social media platforms, have been used by large firms to collect ideas from their users and facilitate the product development process. While it is extensively studied that product ideas with high popularity on OICs are of great importance to the product development, research on what social behaviors of online users lead to the high popularity is largely unclear. This article conducts an empirical study by collecting a large-scale, quantitative dataset from an OIC between 2014 and 2018. With the analysis of users' online idea posting and commenting behaviors, our results reveal that the idea contribution experience, together with comment diversity, positively influence the overall popularity of an individual's ideas, while the motivation of providing comments is negatively related. Moreover, user's innovation capability poses a positive effect on both overall and average popularity of ideas.

This article attempts to know the current situation of BIM and explore the challenges in the BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed research approach that includes a systematic literature review and a survey questionnaire was adopted to achieve the aim of this research. For the systematic review, four main databases were search considering a period of 2010–2019 to identify the main challenges in the BIM implementation. A total of 39 different challenges from 47 documents were classified into four main categories. A structured questionnaire developed on these challenges was sent to 206 selected from the top construction organizations from all over the GCC region. Findings: A total of 39 different challenges from 47 documents were classified into four main categories. The respondents for the questionnaire were selected from the top construction organization from all over the GCC region. A large number of the respondents (69.79%) reported that their organizations are planning for BIM implementation in their future projects. The results show that top challenges fall under the main categories of “Organization”, “Technical”, “Government and Legal” and “Environment”. Research limitations/implications: While the paper provides an overview of BIM in a global context, however, the dynamics and maturity of the construction industry in different regions are quite different from each other. Since the data collected in this research is from the GCC region, the results are more relevant to the GCC region. Practical implications: The finding of this research identifies the main challenges which GCC construction is facing in the implementation of BIM. The finding will, therefore, be useful for the key stakeholders to develop strategies to overcome these challenges and pave the road to take the advantages of BIM implementation in construction. Social implications: The BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry will not only improve the performance of the industry but will also open the doors for new opportunities and employment. The BIM implementation in construction will help the region to achieve Goal 9 (industrial innovation and improved infrastructure) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Originality/value: The results of this study help to understand the overall situation including the challenges in the BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry. This study will be helpful for all the stakeholders to develop strategies for the effective implementation of BIM in the GCC construction industry. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Building information modelling; International construction; International practice; Knowledge management; Organization; Project management","Construction industry; Surveys; Sustainable development; Construction organizations; Design/methodology/approach; Gulf Cooperation Council; Industrial innovation; Research approach; Social implication; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103890121

This situation raises critical questions regarding value creation as prior research suggests mixed effects of SSTs on customers and unclear implications of SSTs for firm customer growth. These implications are accentuated when firms offer innovative electronic services because of customers’ unfamiliarity with the services. In turn, this dynamic raises vital questions about (a) how SSTs influence firm customer growth, particularly when the firm’s electronic services are more innovative, and (b) what complementary investments help firms achieve customer growth from SSTs and innovative electronic services. In this study, we conceptualize the theoretical mechanisms underlying these relationships and empirically examine seven-year longitudinal secondary data of over 3,800 credit unions in the United States to obtain three main findings. First, consistent with prior views of SSTs, we find no significant unconditional effect of SSTs on firm customer growth. Second, we find that the innovativeness of the firm’s electronic services (IES) negatively moderates the influence of SSTs on firm customer growth, suggesting that SSTs may positively influence growth when IES is low but may deter growth when IES is high. Third, marketing intensity and human capital intensity positively moderate the influence of IES on the effect of SSTs on customer growth. In supplementary analysis, we find similar results using cross-sectional primary data from a sample of 186 U.S. credit unions and their customers matched with secondary data. Our unique theoretical contribution lies in highlighting that innovative electronic services on SSTs aimed at bringing the enterprise to the customer may not be enough for firms to achieve customer growth unless those services are accompanied by complementary investments in marketing and human capital. © 2022 INFORMS","business value of IT; credit unions; firm performance; human capital; innovation; IT-enabled services; marketing; self-service technologies","Commerce; Investments; Personnel; Business value; Business value of IT; Complementary investments; Electronic services; Firm Performance; Human capitals; Innovation; IT-enabled services; Self-service technology; Value of IT; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134665044

Customers arrive to the system according to a stochastic process and, upon arrival, decide whether to purchase the service, depending on their willingness to pay and the current price. The service time during which the resource is used by the customer is stochastic, and the firm may incur a service cost. This model represents various markets for reusable resources, such as cloud computing, shared vehicles, rotable parts, and hotel rooms. In the present paper, we analyze this pricing problem when the firm attempts to maximize a weighted combination of three central metrics: profit, market share, and service level. Under Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and standard assumptions on the willingness-to-pay distribution, we establish a series of results that characterize the performance of static pricing in such environments. In particular, although an optimal policy is fully dynamic in such a context, we prove that a static pricing policy simultaneously guarantees 78.9% of the profit, market share, and service level from the optimal policy. Notably, this result holds for any service rate and number of units the firm operates. Our proof technique relies on a judicious construction of a static price that is derived directly from the optimal dynamic pricing policy. In the special case in which there are two units and the induced demand is linear, we also prove that the static policy guarantees 95.5% of the profit from the optimal policy. Our numerical findings on a large test bed of instances suggest that the latter result is quite indicative of the profit obtained by the static pricing policy across all parameters. © 2021 INFORMS","approximation algorithm; dynamic pricing; reusable resources; static pricing","Approximation algorithms; Commerce; Competition; Poisson distribution; Profitability; Random processes; Sales; Stochastic systems; Dynamic pricing; Market share; Optimal policies; Pricing policy; Reusable resources; Service levels; Service time; Static pricing; Technical notes; Willingness to pay; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133979823

According to industry reports, retrials are listed as a top annoying issue for customers and hurt call centers’ profits. Though recognizing this problem, call centers find it challenging to reduce retrials without overshooting their operating expenses. Our research aims to empirically understand the mechanism of customer retrials and then provide economically feasible solutions to reduce retrials. Academic/practical relevance: Little empirical research has been done to understand customers’ strategic retrials, and theoretical research studies retrials by assuming the degree to which pickup speed and service quality impact retrials. Our research empirically investigates the mechanism of customer retrials by studying whether speed and quality truly matter and, if so, how strong the impact is from each of them and whether the impacts are different across various customer segments. The quantified mechanism can then guide service providers to reduce retrials cost-effectively. Methodology: We use a random-coefficient dynamic structural model to characterize customer decisions in pursuing a satisfactory resolution and estimate the parameters from call-by-call records of a uniquely designed call center. Our model tracks customer decisions in the online waiting stage, in which customers are waiting for an agent but weighing whether to abandon, and in the off-line waiting stage, in which customers are not directly connected but are actively debating whether to retry. Utilizing the hybrid system that sequentially places customers into queues for three distinct quality service groups, we disentangle the effects of pickup speed and service quality on customers’ abandonment and retrial decisions. Results: Our estimations confirm that high service quality and quick pickup speed reduce retrials. Moreover, we discover that private customers are more sensitive to quality but less sensitive to speed compared with business customers. We suggest two service designs to reduce retrials cost-effectively by tailoring services to customer preferences. One reallocates the service groups for different customer segments without expanding the system, and the other adjusts the staffing ratios by hiring low-cost, ordinary-quality agents. Under the two tailoring designs, business customer surplus increases by up to 14.4% and private customer surplus by up to 14.9%. Managerial implications: First, our research highlights the importance of recognizing customers’ off-line decisions, which are impacted by online service offerings and, in turn, affect future online service operations. Neglecting customer retrials leads to suboptimal service designs. Second, by understanding the mechanism of customer retrials empirically, our research guides call centers to reduce retrials cost-effectively with speed–quality balance. Third, our research develops a practical analysis framework for service providers to quantify customer preferences and design tailoring services. © 2021 INFORMS","call centers; customer services; empirical operations management; first-contact resolution; retrials; service speed and quality; structural model","Cost reduction; Hybrid systems; Quality of service; Sales; Speed; Call centers; Contact resolutions; Customer-service; Customers segments; Empirical operations managements; First-contact resolution; Retrial; Service Quality; Service speed; Structural modeling; Pickups",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127983747

We find that the vulnerability and resilience to climate change have a significant impact on the cost government borrowing, after controlling for conventional determinants of sovereign risk. That is, countries that are more resilient to climate change have lower bond yields and spreads relative to countries with greater vulnerability to risks associated with climate change. Furthermore, partitioning the sample into country groups reveals that the magnitude and statistical significance of these effects are much greater in developing countries with weaker capacity to adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Government bond yields and spreads; Resilience; Vulnerability","Developing countries; Economics; Climate change risks; Economic consequences; Global economies; Government bond yield and spread; Government bonds; Resilience; Sovereign risks; Statistical significance; Systemic risks; Vulnerability; Climate change; climate change; governance approach; partitioning; sovereignty; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124198253

Consequently, universities are mandated to transform into Entrepreneurial Universities as a third mission, driving state of the art knowledge, skills acquisition and entrepreneurial mindset that supports technological development and innovations to match up with the emerging needs of Malaysia's economy. Therefore, this study assesses the influence of entrepreneurial universities on the development of social capital. Questionnaires were used to retrieve data from a sample of 382 students in two Institutions. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The direct relationships between the three measures of entrepreneurial university (Input, Process and Output) indicated a positively significant relationship with social capital. However, the moderating effects of Entrepreneurial Intention were supported. Our paper contributes to the literature by examining the role of Entrepreneurial Universities using the three factors of inputs, processes and outputs on social capital development and concurrently examining the moderating effect of Entrepreneurial Intention. It also provides evidence-based support to develop models for emerging entrepreneurial universities in Malaysia which can help the national goal of reducing unemployment due to skill mismatch among graduates. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial universities; Social capital; Youth graduates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123860250

Consequently, this study examines the BIM divide from a multifaceted perspective and evaluates its contextuality via firmographic variables. It mobilizes the digital divide model from the information technology discipline. The contextualized model depicts the BIM divide through four categories of motivational, physical, skills, and usage access. The model was empirically tested through the generalized structured component analysis (GSCA) with data from an international questionnaire survey. The findings underscore the need to rethink BIM adoption as a multifaceted and dynamic process against the extant static two-tiered representation. It highlights a notable BIM divide between firms in developed and developing economies. The findings necessitate further scrutiny of the effect of firms' sizes and ages on BIM adoption and the unavoidable Mathew effect of the BIM divide. Lastly, it provides paths in driving BIM implementation for stakeholders and policymakers and highlights the need to be context conscious in advocating for the transferability of global best practices in BIM adoption. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","BIM; Developed economies; Developing economies; Digital divide; SMEs","Industrial economics; Surveys; Architecture engineering; Building Information Modelling; Component analysis; Contextuality; Developed economies; Developing economies; Digital divide; Dynamic process; Questionnaire surveys; Research studies; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120946627

Usually, general contractors carry a portion of the work and subcontract other parts to eventually submit a holistic joint bid. This bidding setting is referred to as multistage bidding where subcontractors submit their quotations/bids to the general contractor, after which the general contractor submits a final joint bid for the whole project. In a multistage bidding environment, general contractors may be faced with an increase in the probability of negative or below normal profits. Despite previous research efforts for developing bidding models, there is a need for the extension of existing literature to tackle the multistage bidding environment, referred to hereinafter as multistage game (MSG). As such, the goal of this paper is to develop a bidding model for the MSG. The authors followed a multistep research methodology comprised of: (1) defining MSG in terms of game theory; (2) deriving a game-theoretic bid function for general contractors to determine the final joint bid to submit in MSG; and (3) developing a simulation model for MSG, using a data from 2,235 US public infrastructure projects. Results demonstrate that the new bid function gives general contractors a competitive advantage by avoiding the occurrence of negative profits in their part of the project. Also, results show a reduction in the occurrence and magnitude of the negative profits in relation to the final joint bids. This research significantly contributes to the body of knowledge by providing an innovative bid function for MSG. In addition, it offers substantial practical benefits for general contractors by providing a tool that facilitates dealing with the inherent complexity and uncertainties related to actual cost estimation within the MSG decision-making process. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Competition; Contractors; Cost estimating; Decision making; Game theory; Bid functions; Bidding models; Bidding strategy; Competitive bidding; General contractors; Multi-stages; Project contractors; Public construction projects; Public infrastructure project; Public project; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119718299

We consider different error structures to capture the co-movement of volatility (co-volatility) between commodity futures to obtain out-of-sample forecasts of the realized volatilities of agricultural commodity futures at daily, weekly, and monthly forecast horizons. We also consider global oil volatility as an additional exogenous predictor and assess forecast precision based on both statistical and economic value measures. The results show that the MHAR model with a co-volatility error structure is superior in predicting the volatility of commodity futures. The most accurate predictions are of corn, cotton, and wheat futures volatility. Interestingly, for all the commodities, the forecasting accuracy noticeably improves as the forecast horizon increases. However, from an investment perspective, the highest economic value is gained from medium-horizon forecasts, and the economic value of forecasts is highest for less risk-averse investors. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Cotton; Economics; Forecasting; Accurate prediction; Agricultural commodity futures; Commodity futures; Error structures; Forecast precision; Forecasting accuracy; Out-of-sample forecast; Realized volatility; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114427883

The out-of-sample forecasting results based on two loss functions and the Diebold–Mariano predictive accuracy test for multiple models show that the GAS framework outperforms GARCH and EGARCH models, particularly for crude oil assets. For natural gas, no specific model retains an advantage over the other two models as the predictive accuracy changes over forecasting horizons and varies across markets. Meanwhile, the GAS model performs well in both developed and developing markets. The cumulated sum of squared forecast error differential (CSSFED) graphically monitors the evolution of the relative forecasting performance of different models and shows that the superiority of GARCH is vulnerable to extraordinary event shocks.

We develop a number of spatial mechanisms to assess how these intermediary factors limit and/or enhance the effect of FDI on economic growth. In particular, we test whether different levels of resource rents, severity of civil conflict and openness to international trade are statistically different in attenuating direct and indirect (spillover) effects of inbound FDI on growth. Last, we conduct a test of asymmetry to investigate whether the effect of FDI on growth is statistically different from zero in three democratic (autocratic) regimes, that is, low democratic (high autocratic), moderate democratic–autocratic and high democratic (low autocratic) societies. A number of insightful contributions to the economic growth-FDI literature can be extracted from our analyses. First, results indicate that inbound FDIs on their own have positive and significant effect on economic growth. However, the positive FDI effect on growth is significantly dampened by the negative intermediary role of civil conflict. Second, we find that, the more opened sub-Saharan African economies are to international trade, the greater is the impact of FDI on growth. However, trade among African countries as a share of their economies plays insignificant intermediation role on direct and indirect effects of FDI on growth. Third, we find that an increase in resource rents as a share of the economy significantly reduces direct and spillover effects of inbound FDI on economic growth. Last, our analysis indicates that both low democratic (high autocratic) and high democratic (low autocratic) regimes do accelerate the positive impact of FDI on growth. However, results indicate a slow-down effect of FDI on growth under moderate democratic–autocratic regimes. This particular finding suggests that the intermediary role of democracy in determining the effect of FDI on economic growth is non-linear. A number of policy implications can be extrapolated from our analysis. Most importantly, trade policies, which boost integration of sub-Saharan African countries and open up the continent to the rest of the world, are likely to play major intermediation roles in accelerating the positive effect of FDI on growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","conflict; democracy; economic growth; FDI inflows; natural resources; spatial dependence; sub-Saharan Africa; trade","conflict management; democracy; economic growth; foreign direct investment; neighborhood; spatial analysis; trade; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111710262

This research aims to provide insights and evidence for data-driven decision making in reforming individual health insurance markets and optimizing individual health insurance operations. We employ traditional, non-oriented slack-based, order-α partial frontier, bootstrapped bias-corrected, and modified context-dependent data envelopment analysis (DEA) models, as well as generalized linear, Tobit, and residual inclusion regression models. We find that higher competition or expansion is not associated with higher consumer efficiency or societal efficiency. Our results also indicate that, in minimizing premiums or expenses given enrollment and utilization of medical services, individual health plans are less efficient than Medicaid managed care plans, but more efficient than Medicare Advantage plans. Our findings imply that, for individual plans, expanding interstate markets is not accompanied with lower premiums or expenses without the sacrifice of medical services. This research suggests that it should be advisable to structure individual health insurance markets following the Medicaid managed care model but not the Medicare Advantage model.

Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, in this research a model was presented to select the best maintenance strategy at Kaghaz Kar Kasra Co of Iran. In this study, it was tried to integrate the two techniques of goal programming and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize maintenance strategies. First, all factors affecting maintenance were identified, and based on the Best Worst Method (BWM) the degree of their importance was determined. Findings: After the evaluation, only 14 criteria in the 4 dimensions of cost, added value, safety and feasibility were selected. The highest points were given to the criteria of equipment cost and depreciation, equipment and personnel performance, equipment installation time and technical feasibility, respectively. In the next stage, using the TOPSIS method the item of maintenance strategy was ranked, and the 3 strategies of preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PDM) and corrective maintenance (CM) were chosen. Modeling was performed utilizing a goal programming approach to select the optimal maintenance strategy for 13 devices.

The buyer suffers economic damages if a violation at a supplier is exposed (whether by the media, regulator, or nongovernmental organization). To avoid damages, the buyer may audit the network to identify noncompliance. If a supplier fails an audit, the buyer must take one of two costly actions: either rectify the supplier or drop the supplier (along with any dependent suppliers). Dropping a supplier changes the network topology, reducing competition and thereby increasing the buyer’s input cost arising from an equilibrium. We show that the buyer’s optimal dynamic auditing policy has two subphases: the buyer will first audit and drop some suppliers before either auditing and rectifying all remaining suppliers or halting auditing altogether. By halting, the buyer tolerates some noncompliance in the network (“see no evil, hear no evil”). Within the audit-and-drop subphase, when auditing only in the upper tier, the buyer always audits a least valuable unaudited supplier, yielding greater balance in the network. When the buyer audits both tiers, it might choose a supplier other than the least valuable. The buyer may choose a supplier in a pivotal position to help ascertain the viability of a portion of the network (“litmus test”). In extensions, we find that when violations in tier 1 carry a higher penalty for the buyer, the buyer may audit and rectify only tier 1 suppliers; when audits may be inaccurate, the buyer more likely tolerates a greater level of noncompliance. © 2021 INFORMS","auditing; socially responsible sourcing; supply networks; supply risk","Network topology; Sales; Supply chains; Auditing; Economic damages; Network topology; Nongovernmental organizations; Social responsibilities; Socially responsible sourcing; Sub-phase; Supply chain network; Supply networks; Supply risk; Drops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132780722

To cope with this, a decoupled off-design LAES model was developed, and integrated into a micro-grid mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) design framework. This methodology enables studying the optimal energy to power ratios of LAES, and the identification of specific value streams of the storage, as well as optimally sizing the micro-grid equipment and LAES units simultaneously, to achieve the balanced economics and environmental benefits. The simulation has led to three major results. Firstly, the optimal charge/discharge power and storage capacity of LAES vary with the services it provides. The optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio are 8/3 h, 12/6 h and 12/6 h corresponding to the arbitrage, wind stabilization and operating reserve. Secondly, for a micro-grid with ∼50% of wind power, LAES presents the key value in supporting the system operation by providing multiple functions. It is split into six explicit revenue streams that can be stacked up for the first time, including the time shifting (13.2%), renewable firming (11.4%), peak shaving (28%), flexibility (21%) and reserve value (20.4%), as well as the waste heat recovery (6%). Thirdly, in comparison with the mildly reduced LAES capital cost and enlarged electricity price differences, a higher renewable percentage would be a major driving force to increase the attractiveness of LAES in micro-grids. The system design framework can determine the optimal sizes of the micro-grid components and the LAES units. Specifically, the optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio (27/14 h) and the storage tank size (608 t) of LAES in a micro-grid with 75% wind power are obtained, leading to ∼60% of carbon emission reduction on the 2016 level. The importance of this work lies in it provides the preliminary business model of applying small-scale LAES in hybrid renewable micro-grids, and can promote the optimal deployment of LAES under different scenarios in micro-grids. © 2021","Decoupled liquid air energy storage; Hybrid renewable micro-grid; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimal design and operation; Optimal energy to power ratio; Storage value breakdown","Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Integer programming; Liquefied gases; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Wind power; Decoupled liquid air energy storage; Design and operations; Hybrid renewable micro-grid; Integer Linear Programming; Microgrid; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimal design; Optimal energy; Optimal energy to power ratio; Optimal operation; Power ratio; Storage value breakdown; Optimal systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121903902

Firms generally observe two forms of economic disruption, property damage and business interruption (BI). In contrast to pre-event mitigation intended primarily to avoid property damage, firms can use a variety of resilience tactics once the disaster strikes to reduce BI losses by improving stability and continuity of operations. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by incorporating resilience into longstanding economic production theory and by identifying the key components for evaluating the cost and effectiveness of resilience. It also makes important empirical contributions by designing, administering, and analyzing surveys of firms affected by two of the most devastating disasters in US history. This paper is the first to econometrically analyze these production theory relationships, identifying the cost-effectiveness of a full range of explicit resilience tactics. Results show that BI losses exceeded property damage losses by over 900% and, on average, firms avoided $4.57 in BI for every dollar spent on resilience. Generalizable comparative static estimates are presented for the manufacturing sector to test formalized relationships, which identify that tactics capable of improving factor productivity can significantly enhance the cost-effectiveness of resilience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Economic resilience; Natural hazards economics; Production and operations management; Production theory; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Survey research","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Surveys; Catastrophic event; Economic production; Economic resilience; Natural hazard; Natural hazard economic; Production and operations management; Production theory; Property damage; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Survey research; Cost effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121591569

Numerous studies have recognised that a gender gap exists not only in entrepreneurship but also in development outcomes, such as firm performance and poverty alleviation. Few, though, have considered the role of institutions in incentivising women and men in the generational improvement process, such as social mobility. Hence, does the institutional environment framing gender differences constrain or enable potential effects of female (compared with male) entrepreneurs on microeconomic outcomes such as social mobility? We investigate the institutional influence on the probability of becoming a female entrepreneur and the effect of this decision on social mobility in developing countries. We test gender comparisons through two-stage probit least squares (2SPLS), showing that post-materialism, autonomy, network membership, democracy, and respect for human rights have positive effects on both women's and men's self-employment jointly as well as female self-employment specifically. We also show that the decision to become an entrepreneur has a greater influence on social mobility for female than for male entrepreneurs. Policy implications regarding gender equality are discussed. © 2021","Developing countries; Female entrepreneurship; Female self-employment; Institutional economics; Social mobility","Economic and social effects; Employment; Public policy; Economic development; Female entrepreneurs; Female entrepreneurship; Female self-employment; Institutional analysis; Institutional economics; National level; Regional levels; Self employment; Social mobility; Developing countries; developing world; entrepreneur; self employment; social mobility; womens employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120535178

To this point, however, little is known about the extent to which those investment projects inspire popular support for a China model of development in Africa, or whether Chinese FDI invites skepticism and concern among community members in the region. In this study, we investigate the effects of proximity to Chinese FDI on local perceptions of China's approach to development in Africa. We geolocate 200 Chinese investment projects, and we spatially connect those data to responses from over 35,000 georeferenced survey respondents across 21 countries. By comparing responses from those living near operational Chinese FDI projects to responses from those living near eventual locations of Chinese investment but where no project yet exists at the time of the survey, we determine the proximity effects of Chinese FDI on views of the China model of development while accounting for the potential nonrandom location of those investment projects. The findings indicate that, on average, living near Chinese FDI projects reduces support for a China model of development. Furthermore, specific types of FDI projects evoke distinct evaluations of China's presence. Specifically, respondents living near manufacturing projects view infrastructure development as a positive contribution from China, whereas those living near resource-related projects express concerns about Chinese land grabs and job threats. Those living near service projects hold more mixed views. The results suggest that people living in close proximity to Chinese FDI projects in Africa are swayed less by global development narratives than by how those projects shape their everyday lives and experiences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Afrobarometer; China model; Development; FDI; Georeferenced data","economic development; foreign direct investment; infrastructural development; numerical model; perception; survey; Africa; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119155936

In most cases, however, current policies target new construction and operational carbon emissions only, thus omitting the significant carbon emission saving potential resulting from the reactivation of embodied carbon in existing buildings. This article describes the development of a high-resolution combined building stock model (BSM) and building energy model (BEM) on both building and urban scale using all residential buildings of Ithaca, NY, USA as a case study. The model offers a holistic, detailed and local perspective on operational and embodied carbon emissions, associated saving potentials at both the building and urban scale, and the linkages, trade-offs and synergies between buildings and energy use as a basis for decision-making. A circular economy (CE) in construction posited on the reuse and recycling of existing building materials, necessitates a detailed material inventory of the current building stock. However, the scale and nature of this endeavor preclude traditional survey methods. The modeling process described in this article instead engages a bottom-up data aggregation and analysis approach that combines detailed construction archetypes (CAs) and publicly available, higher-level municipal geospatial data with building metadata defining occupancy and systems to create an autogenerated, detailed 3D geometry. The resulting BSM and BEM can simulate both embodied carbon content and operational carbon emissions of individual buildings within a municipal study with minimal required input data and a feasible computational effort. This provides modelers with a new spatial and geometric fidelity to simulate holistic renewal efforts, and inform carbon neutrality policies and incentives towards the decarbonization of the built environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Building stock modeling; Circular economy; Embodied and operational carbon; Sustainability; Urban building energy modeling; Urban planning","Buildings; Construction; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Building energy model; Building stock modeling; Building stocks; Carbon emissions; Circular economy; Embodied and operational carbon; Savings potential; Stock models; Urban building energy modeling; Urban buildings; Carbon; building; carbon emission; energy conservation; energy planning; sustainability; urban planning; Article; building industry; city planning; economic aspect; environmental sustainability; urban area; Ithaca [New York]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118579949

Intensification decreases production costs but also leads to substantial environmental impacts. Specifically, nutrient runoff from livestock waste results in eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia. The implementation of nutrient recovery systems in CAFOs can abate nutrient releases and negative ecosystem responses, although they might negatively affect the economic performance of CAFOs. We design and analyze potential incentive policies for the deployment of phosphorus recovery technologies at CAFOs considering the geospatial vulnerability to nutrient pollution. The case study demonstration consists of 2217 CAFOs in the U.S. Great Lakes area. The results reveal that phosphorus recovery is more economically viable in the largest CAFOs due to economies of scale, although they also represent the largest eutrophication threats. For small and medium-scale CAFOs, phosphorus credits progressively improve the profitability of nutrient management systems. The integration of biogas production does not improve the economic performance of phosphorus recovery systems at most of CAFOs, as they lack enough size to be cost-effective. Phosphorus recovery proves to be economically beneficial by comparing the net costs of nutrient management systems with the negative economic impact derived from phosphorus releases. The incentives necessary for avoiding up to 20.7.103 ton/year phosphorus releases and achieve economic neutrality in the Great Lakes area are estimated at $223 million/year. Additionally, the fair distribution of limited incentives is studied using a Nash allocation scheme, determining the break-even point for allocating monetary resources. © 2021","Circular economy; Environmental policy; Incentive policy; Livestock industry; Organic waste; Phosphorus recovery","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Eutrophication; Lakes; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Recovery; Circular economy; Concentrated animal feeding operations; Environmental policy; Great lakes; Incentives policy; Lake areas; Livestock industry; Organic wastes; Phosphorus recovery; Recovery systems; Agriculture; biogas; phosphorus; biogas; environmental economics; environmental policy; incentive; livestock farming; phosphorus; recovery plan; runoff; solid waste; Article; comparative study; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; ecosystem restoration; environmental impact; eutrophication; incentive policy; livestock; manure; metal recovery; nutrient management; nutrient pollution; policy; pollution; renewable energy; United States; Great Lakes [North America]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117600532

Furthermore, few studies have examined service-oriented technologies by a roadmapping method. Methodologically, there are limited roadmapping studies that implement both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Hence, this article aims to offer a foresight for future technologies in the retailing industry using an integrated roadmapping method. To achieve this, we used a sequential method that consisted of both text mining and an expert review process. Our results show clear directions for the future of emerging technologies as the industry moves toward unmanned retail operations. We generate eight clusters of technologies and integrate them into a roadmapping model, illustrating their links to the market and business requirements. Our study has a number of implications and identifies potential bottlenecks between the integration of front- and back-end solutions for the future of unmanned retailing. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Emerging technologies; foresight; patent analysis; retail technologies; technology roadmapping; text mining","Sales; Back-end solutions; Business requirement; Emerging technologies; Future technologies; Qualitative approach; Sequential methods; Strategic innovations; Technology roadmapping; Text mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104675070

In recent years, design thinking, a human-centred, problem-solving approach has been used by researchers to address complex social problems. However, a rigorous study of the application of design thinking in the context of digital innovation is absent from current discourse. This study, based on a revelatory case study, explores how design thinking can foster the development of AI-powered innovations, by bridging the divide between human-centric and machine-centric activities. The study extends the concept of design thinking within digital innovation and provides a new lens to consider studies of organisations engaged in AI-powered innovations. By extending the generalisability of design thinking, we provide novel insights about the challenges, benefits, and lessons learned when data scientists adopt design thinking to ‘bridge’ and ‘balance’ their analytical and intuitive thinking.

A face-to-face survey was conducted and the answers of 200 of the participants, who use three active travel modes, namely, walking, cycling, and micromobility, were analysed. The results obtained from the ordered logit models suggest that one-unit higher perception of infrastructure will increase safety and comfort perceptions for both walking and cycling. Females feel less safe while walking and less comfortable while cycling at shared spaces compared to males. Increasing the age group by one unit will decrease the safety and comfort perceptions for walking. The participants who use the shared spaces more frequently perceive that they feel more comfortable with cycling.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore factors affecting the green transformation efficiency of MRBC, which are expected to provide theoretical support and practical guidance for the formulation of scientific and effective transformation strategies. Based on the IPAT-E model and DEMATEL-ISM method, present study identifies and extracts four influencing factors: population, affluence, technology, and energy, and a multilevel systematic structural model of influencing factors was established. Meanwhile, the partial least squares method was employed to establish a structural equation model using data obtained from 110 MRBCs in China between 2009 and 2018. Factors influencing green transformation efficiency in different groups of MRBCs and the heterogeneity of these cities were analyzed. The results showed that affluence and energy had positive and negative direct and significant effects on transformation efficiency at the national level, respectively. At the same time, technology and population played significant positive roles through different intermediaries. Among them, the negative effect of energy was maximum, and the positive effect of technology was significant. From a regional perspective, the impact of affluence on the east, middle, west, and northeast was significant. The east had the greatest positive effect, whereas the west direction was negative. Furthermore, energy had a significant adverse effect on the central, western, and northeastern regions; however, its influence on the eastern region was not significant. The total indirect effects of technology on the east, middle, and northeast were significantly positive, but the impact on the west was not significant. Similarly, the indirect effect of the population was significant, although negative in the West. Based on city types, the influence of affluence on coal, oil, non-ferrous, and ferrous cities was significantly positive, among which the oil cities experienced the most significant influence. In contrast, the role of energy is significantly negative, as coal cities being the largest. The indirect effects of technology and population were also significantly positive. The former had the least impact on non-ferrous metal cities, while the latter had the greatest impact on oil cities. Therefore, the present study presents a multi-factor and systematic research framework to evaluate the factors influencing the green transformation efficiency of MRBCs, specifically evaluating the impact of various factors on China's MRBC green transformation efficiency for the first time; and proposes diverse strategies for different groups of MRBCs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Efficiency; Green transformation; Influencing factors; Mineral resource-based city","Economics; Factor analysis; Least squares approximations; Minerals; Economic growths; Energy; Green transformation; Indirect effects; Influencing factor; Method analysis; Mineral resource-based city; Resource depletion; Resource-based city; Transformation efficiency; Mineral resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119989371

We show that innovation may occur in different economic environments including non-market ones as well as that social innovation will not occur on its own in a purely producer for-profit environment. To explain such cases, we suggest integrating product and user innovation paradigms into the Producer-User Social Innovation (PUSI) Model that demonstrates how infrastructure and enabling technology is provided either by producer or user to introduce new market product or service. To provide face validity and illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach we consider five very different cases. These illustrative examples allowed to provide evidence that user-driven innovation is socially oriented in its nature as it implicitly addresses community or societal needs. In addition to providing insights into the nature of social innovation, the model can be utilized to help understand why social innovation may fail and how to increase the likelihood of success by engaging with appropriate for-profit producers, communities, and users.

It argues that we cannot understand the challenges of technological upgrading of the post-socialist region if we only adopt the lens of what can be termed transition economics. Instead, the post-socialist transformation is an open-ended process whose outcomes can be better understood as a disequilibriating evolutionary process involving the misalignment of different levels and parts of innovation systems. We develop a multi-level analytical framework and outline several major transformation processes involving dynamic interactive capabilities as the core precondition for technology catching up. Technology accumulation and innovation systems are hybrid systems whose dynamism rests on various governing principles. The swing from one pure mode of coordination (plan) to other (market) explains limited technological upgrading in both periods. Dynamic innovation systems are quintessentially hybrid systems. Crucial to this is an understanding of the role which the state plays, both as a contributor and as an obstacle to the transformation towards sustainable economic growth. © 2021","Chris Freeman; Eastern Europe; Former Soviet Union; Innovation systems; Socialism; Transition","Hybrid systems; Chris freeman; Eastern Europe; Economic transformation; Former soviet union; Innovation system; Socialism; Soviet Union; Techno-economics; Transition; Transition economics; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116633479

As a multiplex network structure, cultural interconnectedness refers to the extent of inter-linking in organizational cultures of supply chain members. Complementing ongoing research on supply chain networks, we propose and test the effects of cultural interconnectedness—conditional on production, inventory, and marketing efficiencies—on the next-period change in performance. Our sample consists of supply chain networks of 3434 publicly traded firms representing an unbalanced panel of 28,461 firm-year observations from 2001 to 2017. Controlling for current period performance (return on assets) and growth opportunities (Tobin's Q) and change in performance and change in growth opportunities, cultural interconnectedness is not directly associated with a change in return on assets in the next period, however, it strengthens the relationship between production efficiency or inventory efficiency and change in return on assets in the next period, but not for marketing resource efficiency. Based on recent advances in social network econometrics, our findings are robust to controlling for spatial autocorrelation in supply chain networks, endogeneity, and spillovers among supply chain network partners, and also for LASSO regressions.

This article examines the influence of the current supplier selection routines, supplier evaluation routines and managerial attitude towards relational and performance risks on the future intention to form buyer–supplier partnerships, based on relational and evolutionary economics theory. The analysis is based on 156 questionnaires received from senior executives and supply/logistics managers of UK firms. We found that partner selection routine positively influences firms’ propensity (future intention) to form buyer–supplier partnerships, unlike the supplier evaluation routine and perceptions of both relational risk and performance risk, which were not found to have a significant role. Our findings suggest that firms wishing to initiate buyer–supplier partnerships can increase the likelihood of doing so by ensuring that their supplier selection routines incorporate efforts to establish potential suppliers’ inclination for openness in a relationship, to establish their track record of demonstrating a high degree of integrity with other buyers and to confirm that potential suppliers have a deep knowledge and understanding of the buyer’s business, a recognized strong reputation, and demonstrable financial stability. © 2021 The Author(s).

The aim of this paper is to explore a context where a broader, more holistic perspective exists, focused on the connection of small- and medium-sized environmental organizations with the natural world, why and how this relationship influences strategic thinking and how it enables organizations to leverage limited resources. The research methodology reflects the rationale that a holistic perspective of strategic thinking is best understood by adopting an interpretivist research philosophy, using an inductive, ethnographic approach, focused on interpreting deep, rich layers of meaning within participant data to inform new theory and existing practice. The triangulated multi-method approach, within an embedded case study setting, comprised 38 individual interviews and 4 workshops (group interviews, participant observation) drawn from 29 organizations across the United Kingdom. The findings indicate that the strategic thinking process is emergent, complex, interconnected, informal and is embedded within pivotal places alongside governance, strategic planning and other key processes. Participants are driven by a strong embodied personal connection with nature, extending well beyond the cognitive dimension (mind) to a diverse range of sensibilities (heart, body and spirit) and share an experiential process of connection that binds them together as purpose- and value-driven organizations. The implication is that a connection to nature underpins all aspects of the strategic processes within participant organizations and is fundamentally important to decision-making at all levels, both strategic and implementational. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"decision making; holistic approach; organization; strategic approach; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114491673

Specifically, we focus on the 2015 EU milk quota abolition, which initiated major dairy expansion in Ireland. We use a representative sample of Irish dairy farms from 2000 to 2017, that includes data on farm specific GHG emissions. Based on this detailed farm level panel data set, we estimate productivity with a control function approach. We then apply fixed effects and dynamic panel data methods to explore the implications of productivity and scale on GHG emission intensity. Our findings indicate that increased productivity is negatively associated with GHG emission intensity, which changes with distinct milk quota abolition phases. Overall, our findings are important for understanding the relationship between policy reforms and GHG emissions in agriculture, and how to improve agricultural mitigation strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

This study investigates various managerial aspects that affect the implementation of KEs. After conducting a literature review and gathering experts’ inputs, the objectives of the study and six research questions were formulated. A survey questionnaire responded by 175 manufacturing organisations was designed and validated. A combined approach of descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA tests were used to analyse the collected data. Besides other ‘soft’ aspects, the results determine: (1) the drivers and barriers in the pre-implementation stage of KEs; (2) the critical success factors and challenges related to the implementation stage of KEs; (3) the reasons that result in unsuccessful KEs; and (4) the reasons that stop organisations from running KEs. The study provides insights into an under-researched topic by looking at different phases of KEs implementation. The study contributes to the contingency and the RBV theories by offering an understanding of the importance of different contingencies and resources planning for KEs implementation.

Their importance motivates the creation of suitable performance evaluation approaches for identifying weaknesses and designing focused interventions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is twofold: (a) provide an approach for GD performance evaluation and (b) propose interventions tackling the GDs’ weaknesses. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was first applied to calculate the initial criteria and subcriteria weights under vagueness. Then, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) was implemented to evaluate interrelations. FAHP and DEMATEL were later combined to estimate the final criteria and subcriteria weights under vagueness and interdependency. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to rank the GDs and detect improvement opportunities. A case study of a cluster including three GDs is presented to validate the proposed approach. The results evidenced that patient safety and service quality are the most critical aspects in GD performance evaluation. The results from this application can be used by healthcare managers for designing focused interventions targeting improved performance of GDs. This paper fully exploits the advantages of FAHP, DEMATEL, and TOPSIS methods for evaluating performances of GDs. Furthermore, this study presents a novel decision-making model representing the multifactorial context of the GD performance. © 2021 The Authors.

One important goal of SEA is to increase sales. Nevertheless, while previous research has studied multiple factors that are potentially related to the outcome of SEA campaigns, effects of these factors on actual sales generated by SEA remain understudied. It is also unclear whether and how such effects change over time in dynamic SEA campaigns that last for an extended period of time. As the first empirical investigation of the dynamic advertisement-sales relationship in SEA, this study builds an advertising response model within a time-varying coefficient (TVC) modeling framework, and estimates the model using a unique dataset from a large e-commerce retailer in the United States. Results reveal the effects of the advertising expenditure, consumer behaviors and advertisement characteristics on realized sales, and demonstrate that such effects on sales do change over time in non-linear ways. More importantly, we find that carryover has a stronger effect in generating sales than immediate or direct response does, and advertisers need to carefully decide how much to bid for higher ad positions. These findings have direct implications for business decision-making to launch more effective SEA campaigns and for SEA platforms to improve their pricing mechanism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Advertising analytics; Business intelligence; Electronic commerce; Online advertising","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Large dataset; Sales; Search engines; Advertizing; Advertizing analytic; Advertizing campaigns; Business impact; Business-intelligence; Change-over time; Empirical investigation; Multiple factors; Online advertizing; Time-varying effects; Electronic commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139638059

US COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","Academic researchers, government agencies, industry groups, and individuals have produced forecasts at an unprecedented scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. To leverage these forecasts, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with an academic research lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to create the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Launched in April 2020, the Forecast Hub is a dataset with point and probabilistic forecasts of incident cases, incident hospitalizations, incident deaths, and cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 at county, state, and national, levels in the United States. Included forecasts represent a variety of modeling approaches, data sources, and assumptions regarding the spread of COVID-19. The goal of this dataset is to establish a standardized and comparable set of short-term forecasts from modeling teams. These data can be used to develop ensemble models, communicate forecasts to the public, create visualizations, compare models, and inform policies regarding COVID-19 mitigation. These open-source data are available via download from GitHub, through an online API, and through R packages. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"epidemiology; forecasting; human; pandemic; United States; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; COVID-19; Forecasting; Humans; Pandemics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135353963

The subsidy-promoting policies are oftentimes justified on the ground that subsidies increase the recipient firms’ innovation and productivity. We develop a novel (semiparametric) method to structurally identify the firm-level productivity in the presence of subsidies. Unlike previous studies, we assume that subsidies are endogenous. To correct for the endogeneity problem, we use a switching regression in our semiparametric production function. Our method provides an improved framework for estimating the production function with endogenous and/or censored variables. We apply our method to study the effect of subsidies on firm-level productivity in the Chinese machinery industry, using panel data from 1998 to 2007. We find strong empirical evidence that subsidies have a positive effect on firms’ persistent productivity. Subsidies may allow firms to invest more on research and development (R&D) and thus improve productivity. Using the available R&D data, we find evidence to support this explanation that more subsidies are associated with higher R&D investment. We also carry out a decomposition analysis to separately examine the subsidy effect on output via the input channel and the persistent productivity channel. Opposite effects are found from the two channels and overall subsidies have a positive effect on a firm's output. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Endogeneity; Productivity and competitiveness; Semiparametric smooth coefficient models; Subsidies","Competition; Machinery; Chinese manufacturing enterprise; Endogeneity; Firm innovation; Government subsidies; Production function; Productivity and competitiveness; Research and development; Semiparametric; Semiparametric smooth coefficient models; Subsidy; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126038416

We utilize a similarity calculation method based on natural language processing (NLP) and text mining to evaluate three dimensions of information timeliness: retrospectiveness, immediateness, and prospectiveness. Public engagement is divided into breadth and depth. The empirical results show that information retrospectiveness is negatively associated with public engagement breadth but positively with depth. Both information immediateness and prospectiveness improved the breadth and depth of public engagement. Interestingly, information richness has a positive moderating effect on the relationships between information retrospectiveness, prospectiveness, and public engagement breadth but no significant effects on immediateness; meanwhile, it has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between retrospectiveness and depth but a positive effect on immediateness, prospectiveness.

Recent work suggests that conservatives are less likely to complain than liberals. Building on that work, the present research examines how political identity shapes customer satisfaction, which has broad implications for customers and firms. Nine studies combine different methodologies, primary and secondary data, real and hypothetical behavior, different product categories, and diverse participant populations to show that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more satisfied with the products and services they consume. This happens because conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to believe in free will (i.e., that people have agency over their decisions) and, therefore, to trust their own decisions. The authors document the broad and tangible downstream consequences of this effect for customers’ repurchase and recommendation intentions and firms’ sales. The association of political identity and customer satisfaction is attenuated when belief in free will is externally weakened, choice is limited, or the consumption experience is overwhelmingly positive. © The Author(s) 2022.","belief in free will; customer satisfaction; political identity; political ideology; repurchase intention; sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124330252

Team power dynamics can be measured by team power level and team power hierarchy. Team power level is conceptualized as the average level of the possession of resources, expertise, or decision-making authorities of a team. Team power hierarchy represents the vertical differences of the possessions of resources in a team. In Science of Science, few studies have looked at scientific collaboration from the perspective of team power dynamics. This research examines how team power dynamics affect team impact to fill the research gap. In this research, all coauthors of one publication are treated as one team. Team power level and team power hierarchy of one team are measured by the mean and Gini index of career age of coauthors in this team. Team impact is quantified by citations of a paper authored by this team. By analyzing over 7.7 million teams from Science (e.g., Computer Science, Physics), Social Sciences (e.g., Sociology, Library & Information Science), and Arts & Humanities (e.g., Art), we find that flat team structure is associated with higher team impact, especially when teams have high team power level.

In some regions, the implementation of large-scale bike-sharing systems and improved cycling infrastructure are two of the factors enabling this growth. An increase in non-motorized modes of transportation makes our cities more human, decreases pollution, traffic, and improves quality of life. In many cities around the world, urban planners and policymakers are looking at cycling as a sustainable way of improving urban mobility. Although bike-sharing systems generate abundant data about their users’ travel habits, most cities still rely on traditional tools and methods for planning and policy-making. Recent technological advances enable the collection and analysis of large amounts of data about urban mobility, which can serve as a solid basis for evidence-based policy-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical method that can be used to process millions of bike-sharing trips and analyze bike-sharing mobility, abstracting relevant mobility flows across specific urban areas. Backed by a visualization platform, this method provides a comprehensive set of analytical tools to support public authorities in making data-driven policy and planning decisions. This paper illustrates the use of the method with a case study of the Greater Boston bike-sharing system and, as a result, presents new findings about that particular system. Finally, an assessment with expert users showed that this method and tool were considered very useful, relatively easy to use and that they intend to adopt the tool in the near future. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Application case study; Bike-sharing; Data science; Mobility; Open source software; Visualization","Abstracting; Data visualization; Decision making; Nonmotorized transportation; Urban planning; Analytical method; Analytical tool; Large amounts of data; Non-motorized modes; Public authorities; Technological advances; Tools and methods; Visualization platforms; Bicycles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102891281

Therefore, understanding taxi drivers' behaviors and learning the good passenger-seeking strategies are crucial to boost taxi drivers' well-being and public transportation quality of service. However, we observe that drivers' preferences of choosing which area to find the next passenger are diverse and dynamic across locations and drivers. It is hard to learn the location-dependent preferences given the partial data (i.e., an individual driver's trajectory may not cover all locations). In this article, we make the first attempt to develop conditional generative adversarial imitation learning (cGAIL) model, as a unifying collective inverse reinforcement learning framework that learns the driver's decision-making preferences and policies by transferring knowledge across taxi driver agents and across locations. Our evaluation results on three months of taxi GPS trajectory data in Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that the driver's preferences and policies learned from cGAIL are on average 36.2 percent more accurate than those learned from other state-of-the-art baseline approaches. © 2015 IEEE.","generative adversarial imitation learning; inverse reinforcement learning; Urban computing","Global positioning system; Location; Location based services; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Taxicabs; Trajectories; Urban transportation; Decisions makings; Features extraction; Generative adversarial imitation learning; Imitation learning; Inverse reinforcement learning; Public transportation; Quality-of-service; Road; Taxi drivers; Urban computing; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097146835

We consider an entrepreneur who uses outside financing and exerts private effort to build a platform and users who decide whether to join in response to the platform’s dynamic transaction fee policy. We first show that raising capital by issuing tokens rather than equity mitigates effort under-provision because the payoff to equity investors depends on profit, whereas the payoff to token investors depends on transaction volume, which is less sensitive to effort. Second, we show that decentralized governance associated with tokenization eliminates a potential holdup of platform users, which in turn alleviates the need to provide users with incentives to join, reducing the entrepreneur’s financing burden. The downside of tokenization is that it puts a cap on how much capital the entrepreneur can raise. Namely, if tokens are highly liquid, that is, they change hands many times per unit of time, their market capitalization is small relative to the net present value (NPV) of the platform profits, limiting how much money one can raise by issuing tokens rather than equity. If building the platform is expensive, this can distort the capacity investment. The resulting tradeoff between the benefits and costs of tokenization leads to several predictions regarding adoption. © 2022 INFORMS.","agency; blockchain; cryptocurrency; entrepreneurial finance; governance; ICO; moral hazard; platform; token","Blockchain; Investments; Risk management; Agency; Block-chain; Decentralised; Entrepreneurial finance; Governance; ICO; Moral hazard; Platform; Token; Tokenization; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139048082

Drawing on an existing theoretical framework in which utility depends on beliefs and the attention paid to them, we develop and test a theory of the demand for information encompassing instrumental considerations, curiosity, and desire to direct attention to beliefs one feels good about. We decompose an individual’s demand for information into the desire to refine beliefs, holding attention constant, and the desire to focus attention on anticipated beliefs, holding these beliefs constant. Because the utility of resolving uncertainty (i.e., refining beliefs) depends on the attention paid to it and more important or salient questions capture more attention, demand for information depends on the importance and salience of the question(s) it addresses. In addition, because getting new information focuses attention on one’s beliefs and people want to savor good news and ignore bad news, the desire to obtain or avoid information depends on the valence (i.e., goodness or badness) of anticipated beliefs. Five experiments (n ＝ 2,361) test and find support for these hypotheses, looking at neutrally valenced as well as ego-relevant information. People are indeed more inclined to acquire information (a) when it feels more important, even if it cannot aid decision making (Experiments 1A and 2A); (b) when a question is more salient, manipulated through time lag (Experiments 1B and 2B); and (c) when anticipated beliefs have higher valence (Experiment 2C). © 2021 INFORMS.","curiosity; information gap; motivated attention; ostrich effect","Behavioral research; Decision theory; Behavioral theory; Curiosity; Decisions makings; Information-gap; Motivated attention; Ostrich effect; Theoretical framework; Time lag; Uncertainty; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139016554

The value is 74 basis points if their suppliers experienced a CDS up-jump event.

Specifically, they allow consumers to invite peers from social media to request a discount for their purchases. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose social pricing, a novel pricing framework under which consumers with higher social capital enjoy a better price. Conceptually, social pricing enables firms to achieve price discrimination based on a consumer’s social value. This is in sharp contrast with traditional price discrimination strategies where price differentiation typically hinges on consumers’ personal value (individual willingness to pay). Although social pricing has been popular in practice, whether it works, why it works, and how it works remain unclear because of a lack of rigorous academic research. To address this gap, we design and conduct two randomized field experiments on a leading online fresh food retailer to understand the value of social pricing. Social pricing has been commonly credited for its effectiveness in new customer acquisition. Interestingly, our study reveals that it is also highly effective on existing consumers. Our analysis shows that social pricing can increase an online retailer’s profit by 40% solely from existing consumers, compared with regular firm-offered discounts. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms reveals that perceived engagement and social cost are the main drivers here, which not only help to increase purchasing frequency but also induce higher order value per purchase. In a follow-up experiment, we vary the rules of social interactions by requiring heterogeneity in consumers’ purchasing frequencies. The results suggest that a heterogeneity-based strategy can further amplify the benefits of social pricing. In summary, our study conceptualizes a novel pricing scheme, social pricing, and provides valuable guidance to both researchers and practitioners by offering actionable insights regarding the design of social pricing strategies. © 2022 INFORMS.","field experiments; price discrimination; social commerce; social pricing","MESH networking; Purchasing; Sales; Field experiment; Price differentiation; Price discrimination; Pricing strategy; Sharp contrast; Social capitals; Social commerces; Social media; Social pricing; Social values; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129682875

We use count estimation techniques and control for a large set of firm-specific characteristics and market developments in REN and FF technologies. We find that patenting activities of firms specialized in REN innovation are significantly more sensitive to a shock in cash flows than firms specializing in FF innovation.

Estimating optimal weights that can outperform simple averages is not always an easy task. In recent years, the idea of using time series features for forecast combinations has flourished. Although this idea has been proved to be beneficial in several forecasting competitions, it may not be practical in many situations. For example, the task of selecting appropriate features to build forecasting models is often challenging. Even if there was an acceptable way to define the features, existing features are estimated based on the historical patterns, which are likely to change in the future. Other times, the estimation of the features is infeasible due to limited historical data. In this work, we suggest a change of focus from the historical data to the produced forecasts to extract features. We use out-of-sample forecasts to obtain weights for forecast combinations by amplifying the diversity of the pool of methods being combined. A rich set of time series is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our diversity-based forecast combination framework not only simplifies the modeling process but also achieves superior forecasting performance in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The value of our proposition lies on its simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency, elements that are important from both an optimization and a decision analysis perspective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Empirical evaluation; Forecast combination; Forecast diversity; Forecasting; Prediction intervals","Computational efficiency; Time series; Empirical evaluations; Forecast combinations; Forecast diversity; Forecasting models; Historical data; Optimal weight; Out-of-sample forecast; Prediction interval; Simple++; Time series features; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118802998

It is important to explore factors that affect bicycle usage levels thus to help with the planning and operation of bicycle transportation systems. This paper explores the influencing factors of bicycle usage levels and their differences at residential and workplace locations, using the dock-based public bicycle sharing system of Xi'an, China. First, six levels of bicycle usage are defined based on cycling frequency, duration, and time of day. Then, five multinomial logistic models are developed to explore the influencing factors of bicycle usage and their differences at residential and workplace locations. Results showed that both the numbers and categories of influencing factors for bicycle usage levels vary with land-use patterns of residential and workplace locations. It is found that perceived cycling-friendly environment contributes a lot to high bicycle usage levels, especially for the group with low education and low monthly income. It is also found that there exists a cooperative relationship between the bicycle system and bus/metro system in some residential areas. The findings of this paper can help planners and decision-makers better understand the key influencing factors in bicycle usage behavior thus to make effective policies in planning and operating bicycle transportation systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bicycle usage level; Built environment; Influencing factors; Land-use pattern; Multinomial logistic model; Psychological factors","Bicycles; Docks; Housing; Hydraulic structures; Land use; Location; Bicycle usage level; Built environment; Influencing factor; Land use pattern; Logistics model; Multinomial logistic model; Multinomial logistics; Psychological factors; Residential locations; Usage level; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130916185

First, using a stylized model, we theoretically demonstrate that although STS is likely to increase sales, it may also entail the risk of losing some customers by exposing them to alternative products at nearby competitors during in-store pickup visits. Online-exclusive products and hybrid products are subject to this tradeoff at different degrees. To minimize the risk of STS, we theoretically propose a channel merchandising strategy for the STS implementation. Next, we empirically test our theoretical predictions using data from an omnichannel retailer that launched the STS functionality. We also conduct an empirical counterfactual analysis to quantify the benefits of our proposed channel merchandising strategy. Overall, our theoretical model coupled with the empirical analysis suggests that to improve the performance of STS implementation, an omnichannel retailer should offer (i) products that are somewhat generic, low-priced, and with high in-store availability as online-exclusive and (ii) products that are somewhat unique, high-priced, and with low in-store availability as hybrid. The counterfactual analysis reveals that the proposed channel merchandising strategy can improve STS performance by increasing overall retail sales by another 2.7% for the focal retailer.

When the price limit occurs, investors tend to chase the continuing upward momentum for profit-making. However, For the stocks that hit daily price limit, we observe whether they close at daily price limit will lead to the opposite price trends of the next trading day. Therefore, this work aims to predict whether a stock that hits its daily price limit will also close at the same price level (i.e., Type I or Type II). The occurrence of price limit is driven by different levels of market state. For example, it can result from macro-economic changes of the whole market, or it can be traced to some industry-specific factors. A challenging task is to learn a better stock representation with less uncertainty by comprehensively considering the hierarchical property of market state. Accordingly, we design a novel hierarchical architecture, called Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN), to investigate the market state at hierarchical view for stock type prediction. In HGNN, we construct the stock relation graph and merge stock information hierarchically extracted from multiple views of market state, including node view, relation view and graph view, which takes both historical sequence pattern and stock relation into consideration. Our key innovation is the introduction of hierarchical structure makes the predictive model able to more comprehensively infer the hierarchical property of market state. Further, it also provides the deeper insight for the actual investment practice. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct back-testing on the two-year historical data of more than 2500 main-board stocks in two China stock markets, SSE and SZSE. To support further study of the stock type prediction task, we have published two long-range stock datasets (Datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXiAyqt3rHveuzdGT6YtswU1e-tBSFUe/view?usp=sharing). Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions including ALSTM, GCN and GAT with the improvements of at least 3.54% on average in accuracy. In addition, the average return ratio of SSE and SZSE has improved by 18.57% and 8.75%, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Hierarchical graph neural network; Price limit; Stock prediction","Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Network architecture; Graph neural networks; Hierarchical graph neural network; Hierarchical graphs; Price limits; Price trends; Profit making; Property; Stock predictions; Stock price; Type predictions; Graph neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132318738

Our results show that a firm's currency choice, in turn, has a direct causal effect on the exchange rate pass-through into prices and quantities. Moreover, the differential price response of similar firms that invoice in different currencies is large, persists beyond a one-year horizon, and gradually wanes in the long run. This results in allocative expenditure-switching effects on export quantities, which build up over time, suggesting a role for quantity adjustment frictions in addition to price stickiness.

On the other hand, many operations have more than one stage process when some inputs are fed to the system to produce a number of intermediate measures. The intermediate measures are then transformed into final products in the subsequent stages. The composition method in network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) is a popular method for measuring the efficiency of a two-stage process. The composition method is fractional bi-objective programming that is solved by non-linear programming techniques such as bisection search. In this paper, the two-stage NDEA is extended with negative data and undesirable outputs. First, we propose an alternative linear model based on the goal programming technique to avoid complex non-linear calculations. Then, we use a method to transform negative data into positive and undesirable outputs into desirable ones. Finally, we develop the proposed model using the fuzzy α-cut approach in order to incorporate data uncertainty in the linear goal programming (GP) model. To validate the accuracy of the proposed model, a numerical example is solved. To show the applicability of the proposed model, a real case of 22 insurance companies is examined.

However, this variance decomposition research stream has treated firms as atomistic, autonomous entities. We employ a fast-unfolding community-detection algorithm to detect firms' network memberships and use the Shapley Value method to isolate the effect of the firm's alliance network, in addition to industry, corporate parent, business segment, and year effects, on the variance in business unit performance. Our findings demonstrate that the effect of the firm's alliance network explains 11% of the variance in firm ROA among 16,381 business segments from 1979 through 1996. We also extend the time period through 2018 and find that our results broadly hold. Managerial Summary: In the search for superior firm performance, managers typically focus their attention externally on profitable industries in which to operate, as well as internally on their firms' idiosyncratic and valuable resources and capabilities. In addition to these profitability sources, our work suggests another important, but heretofore overlooked, factor in the managerial quest for competitive advantage: the value-creating potential of alliance networks. We employ a machine-learning algorithm to detect firms' network memberships. Our findings indicate that as much as 11% of the variance in firm profitability (ROA) is explained by the network of alliances of which the firm is a part. Our study also implies that the emphasis on networks continues to be relevant in a technology age in which industry boundaries are blurring. © 2022 The Authors.

Although growers increasingly turn to guest-worker programs to meet their labor needs, few regard immigrant workers as a viable long-term solution. Many producers of labor-intensive agricultural commodities regard mechanization as a clear long-term solution, making the slow rate of adoption of mechanized harvesting equipment in the US an empirical puzzle. In this article, we demonstrate that wage-setting farmers have an incentive to “overmechanize,” or employ more than the cost-minimizing level of capital when capital and labor are substitutes, but “undermechanize” when labor and capital are technical complements. This outcome can cause agricultural labor problems to persist under complementarity. To assess the potential role of farm under investment in labor augmenting capital equipment, we examine labor market outcomes following the adoption of non-autonomous harvesting aids on a large strawberry farm in Central California. We develop an econometric model of peer-affected productivity that controls for the group performance of farm workers operating in crews and find that mechanical aids complement labor in strawberry production, a finding that helps explain not only the relative lack of mechanized harvesting in strawberry production but, more generally, the persistent productivity gap in agricultural industries. We examine the broader implications of our theory for the slow rate of adoption of mechanical harvesting technologies in US agriculture by comparing general wage trends across several labor-intensive and non-labor-intensive industries in California. © 2021 The Authors.

We propose using cost-function-based prediction markets as means of sharing demand forecasts. We consider a decentralized two-stage supply chain with a supplier who sells to a retailer, in which both partners receive demand forecast updates. In the first stage, the supplier and the retailer agree on a collaborative forecasting scheme to form a consensus forecast. We consider two schemes: collaborative forecasting using cost-function-based prediction markets in which partners pay a set-up cost to operate a prediction market, and direct collaborative forecasting in which partners directly share their forecasts with each other and resolve their forecast differences through costly actions. In the second stage, we analyze the game between the supplier and the retailer to determine the retailer's optimal order quantity as well as the supplier's optimal wholesale price. We show that demand forecast sharing using cost-function-based prediction markets results in a Pareto improvement of the partners’ profit over the alternative of directly sharing forecasts. Furthermore, we show that this Pareto improvement is monotone with respect to supply chain partners’ forecast accuracy. We conduct an extensive numerical study to provide further insights into the effect of the return on forecast sharing investment, forecast accuracy, and level of demand uncertainty on the benefits gained by implementing cost-function-based prediction markets. © 2021 The Author(s)","Collaborative planning forecasting and replenishment; Cost-function-based prediction market; Forecasting; Supply chain management","Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Investments; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Collaborative forecasting; Collaborative planning forecasting and replenishments; Cost-function-based prediction market; Demand forecast; Forecast accuracy; Forecast sharing; Limited attentions; Pareto improvements; Prediction markets; Supply chain partners; Cost functions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116838847

The suppliers are involved in the development of innovative elements of products, supplementing the capabilities of companies. Strategic relationships are established with these suppliers, where the companies need them to be flexible and willing to adapt to changing demands. Flexibility is usually evaluated against a variety of indicators. However, a high score on flexibility does not guarantee cooperative suppliers. Companies also require power to get a supplier to be flexible. They need suppliers who are malleable to their changing needs that are an inevitable part of design processes. The empirical study at a leading European engine company reported in this article shows that the relative power between companies and suppliers influences the responsiveness of suppliers to requests. This article analyses malleability as a combination of flexibility and relative power. It unpacks power and flexibility into sets of measurable indicators and proposes a tool which assesses both the relative power between buyer and supplier and the supplier's flexibility, to provide a malleability index, which indicates to what extent a supplier is suitable to work with. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Decision making; flexibility; malleability index; power; product innovation and development; TOPSIS","Changing needs; Complex products; Decisions makings; Flexibility; Malleability index; Power; Product innovation; Product innovation and development; Strategic relationships; TOPSIS; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108545728

The BD offers the potential for the FM to obtain valuable insights from a large amount of heterogeneous data collected through various sources and IoT allows for the integration of sensors. The aim of this article is to extend the exploratory studies conducted on Big Data analytics (BDA) implementation and empirically test and categorize the associated drivers and challenges. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the researchers aim to bridge the current knowledge gap and highlight the principal factors affecting the BDA implementation. Questionnaires detailing 26 variables are sent to the FM organization in the U.K. who are in the process or have already implemented BDA initiatives within their FM operations. Fifty-two valid responses are analyzed by conducting EFA. The findings suggest that driven by market competition and ambitious sustainability goals, the industry is moving to holistically integrate analytics into its decision making. However, data quality, technological barriers, inadequate preparedness, data management, and governance issues and skill gaps are posing to be significant barriers to the fulfillment of expected opportunities. The findings of this study have important implications for FM businesses that are evaluating the potential of the BDA and IoT applications for their operations.

Diverse methods for competitor identification have been introduced in the literature, but financial transactions are overlooked in these models even though such transactions among firms, as the basic economic unit of interfirm business activities, contain critical information. This article proposes a novel method for the identification of firm-level competitors using a network constructed from financial transactions among firms. To identify competitors by the intensity of interfirm competition, the proposed method is based on two dimensions of pairs of firms, resource similarity and market commonality, which are represented in a data-driven approach using a transaction network. We propose network-theoretic similarity measures to quantify the resource similarity and market commonality between firms by considering both direct and indirect transactions in a transaction network. Then, based on the two dimensions, three types of competitors are identified with respect to a focal firm: direct, potential, and indirect competitors. The proposed method is applied to toy network data and a real-world case that includes the financial transactions of firms in Korea in 2014. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Competitive analysis; competitor identification (CI); financial transaction network; multimarket competition; similarity measure","Commerce; Economics; Finance; Industry; Supply chains; Atmospheric measurement; Competitive analysis; competitor identification (CI); Financial transactions; Particle measurement; Similarity measure; Systematics; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074842243

This paper also identifies which factors critically influence the efficiency of COVID-19 control measures. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employed two-stage network SBM (slacks-based measure of efficiency) models with variable returns-to-scale and constant returns-to-scale, respectively, among various forms of data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. As a post hoc analysis, the authors used Tobit regression for examining the causal relationship between a nation's cultural dimensions and its COVID-19 control measure's efficiency scores. Findings: The authors found that the pervasive less individualistic and higher uncertainty avoiding culture positively influenced the efficient control of COVID-19 outbreaks since such a culture helped the government impose its mandatory COVID-19 control measures without people's strong resistance to those measures. Originality/value: Many public health policymakers are wondering why COVID-19 control measures are not effective in coping with the COVID-19 outbreaks.

Design/methodology/approach: Four hypothesized relationships are tested with survey data from 190 high-tech firms using structural equation models. Findings: FSCA can be enhanced through the transactive memory system and SNF, although a higher degree of transactive memory system weakens the positive relationship between SNF and FSCA. A positive relationship is identified between FSCA and OP, while FSCA mediates the relationship between SNF and OP. Practical implications: Managers can increase FSCA and improve OP by developing both the transactive memory system and SNF. Given that firms have limited resources, investment in internal capabilities should be prioritized as this appears to be more effective at developing FSCA. Originality/value: The findings expand the literature by exploring two antecedents of FSCA and by analyzing the impact of FSCA on different measures of OP. Few prior studies have highlighted the importance of the transactive memory system to the operations function. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agility; Firm’s supply chain agility; Operational performance; Supply network flexibility; Surveys; Transactive memory system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109864368

There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available. © 2022","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Fbprophet model; Machine learning; Prediction; Time series analysis","Bitcoin; Long short-term memory; Time series analysis; ARIMA models; Digital assets; Fbprophet model; Historical data; Machine-learning; Price prediction; Real-world modeling; Seasonal datum; Seasonality; Time-series analysis; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136285087

However, the literature is mostly silent on actual customer learning (i.e., if customers learn from a salesperson's knowledge brokerage attempts). This research explores customer learning within the lens of the ADDIE instructional process, which we adapt from a classroom setting to the more dynamic world of B2B sales. As educators, we propose that salespeople utilize a variety of influence tactics to transfer knowledge that drives customer learning. We investigate how different influence tactics play a role in the development of both basic and advanced customer learning outcomes. Specifically, using both dyadic survey data and objective sales outcomes, we find that influence tactics have diverging effects on both customer learning types and ultimately profitability. We identify that in the absence of formal tests or assignments used in the classroom to assess learning, salesperson perceptions of customer learning can be misaligned with customer assessments of learning.

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Customer model; Decision support systems; Fashion; Retail supply chain; User model","Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electronic commerce; Online systems; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Customer preferences; Customer-modeling; Decision supports; Decisions makings; E- commerces; Fashion; Online retails; Retail supply chain; Social sustainability; User Modelling; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129897941

Deciding to initiate such an illegal business competition is subject to external environmental factors (EEFs). Understanding the EEFs' impacts on collusive bidding decisions allows institutional arrangements to encapsulate free and fair competition. Although previous studies have examined the EEFs separately, few have explored their synthesis in determining collusive bidding decisions. This study decomposed the EEFs into three categories: economic, industrial, and geographical (EIG), and detected their effects on collusive bidding decisions by using 254 collusive bidding cases gathered from the Chinese construction industry. Results of the data analysis indicated that as a key EEF, industrial competition has a positive effect on bidders' collusive willingness and collusive team number. However, its impacts on collusive bid prices are negative. In addition, the coupling of economic development and industrial competition positively affects bidders' collusive prices. These findings provide new insight into the essence of the EEFs and support the formulation of countermeasures to deter bidders from seeking a to-collude decision. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Collusion prevention; Collusive bidding; Collusive decisions; Coupling; External environment","Competition; Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Office buildings; Anti-trust authorities; Business competition; Collusion preventions; Collusive bidding; Collusive decision; Coupling effect; Environmental factors; External environments; Industrial competition; Institutional arrangement; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128982535

These changes directly affect food supply chain negatively. Thus, transition into more circular approach for green business growth in food supply chains is a necessity. One way to reduce this negativity is to ensure the share of information along the chain. With this context, sharing information and knowledge among the food supply chain can facilitate practices from a circularity and green perspectives. Hence, this research focuses on understanding and revealing knowledge-sharing networks challenges, barriers, and benefits across every food supply chain layer, presenting tangible contributions to improve traceability in circularity perspectives with refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover challenges.

Annals of Economics and Finance, 2002, 3, 103–116 on a panel data set of 19 Eurozone countries over the period 1995–2017. We test for non-linear effects on economic growth for three banking indicators (domestic credit, non-performing loans, and banking capitalization). In contrast to the related literature, our findings provide sufficient evidence of non-linear relationships between several aspects of financial development and economic growth. Our results survive robustness checks implying significant policy implications for policymakers and regulators in their effort of balancing banking development with a resurgence in economic growth within the EU periphery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","banking development; growth; non-linear effects; semi-parametric analysis; socioeconomic aspects","banking; economic growth; financial system; socioeconomic conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092539711

Since special events affect human behaviours, they may increase or decrease the demand for ED services. Therefore, it is crucial to model their impact and use them to forecast future attendance to improve roster planning and avoid reactive strategies. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a forecasting model to generate both point and probabilistic daily forecast of ED attendance. We model the impact of special events on ED attendance by considering real-life ED data. We benchmark the accuracy of our model against three time-series techniques and a regression model that does not consider special events. We show that the proposed model outperforms its benchmarks across all horizons for both point and probabilistic forecasts. Results also show that our model is more robust with an increasing forecasting horizon. Moreover, we provide evidence on how different types of special events may increase or decrease ED attendance. Our model can easily be adapted for use not only by EDs but also by other health services. It could also be generalised to include more types of special events. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Emergency department; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting; Health; Special events",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079184321

Current legislation ensures fairness by barring algorithm designers fromusing demographic information in their decision making. As a result, to be legally compliant, the algorithms need to ensure equal treatment. However, in many cases, ensuring equal treatment leads to disparate impact particularly when there are differences among groups based on demographic classes. In response, several ""fair""machine learning (ML) algorithms that require impact parity (e.g., equal opportunity) at the cost of equal treatment have recently been proposed to adjust for the societal inequalities. Advocates of fair ML propose changing the law to allow the use of protected class-specific decision rules.We show that the proposed fairML algorithms that require impact parity, while conceptually appealing, can make everyone worse off, including the very class they aim to protect. Compared with the current law, which requires treatment parity, the fairML algorithms, which require impact parity, limit the benefits of a more accurate algorithm for a firm. As a result, profit maximizing firms could underinvest in learning, that is, improving the accuracy of their machine learning algorithms. We show that the investment in learning decreases when misclassification is costly, which is exactly the case when greater accuracy is otherwise desired. Our paper highlights the importance of considering strategic behavior of stake holders when developing and evaluating fair ML algorithms. Overall, our results indicate that fair ML algorithms that require impact parity, if turned into law,may not be able to deliver some of the anticipated benefits. © 2021 INFORMS.","algorithmic bias; economics of artificial intelligence; equal impact; equal treatment; fair machine learning","Decision making; Laws and legislation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Population statistics; Algorithmic bias; Algorithmics; Decisions makings; Economic of artificial intelligence; Equal impact; Equal treatment; Fair machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Policy issues; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133245459

Examining SPAC mergers from 2004 through 2021, we find that 80% of firms provide projections for four years ahead on average, with approximately one-quarter of recent projections extending more than five years. For the sample of SPAC mergers with observable postmerger revenue, we find that only 35% of firms meet or beat their projections. This proportion declines for forecasts that are longer horizon, and nonserial SPAC sponsors miss forecasts by greater percentages. When we compare SPAC projected revenue growth with benchmark samples of firms completing an initial public offering (IPO) and matched firms, the SPAC projections are approximately three times larger on average than benchmark firms’ actual revenue growth, with even greater differences for long-term projections. After the merger, firms reduce their use of projections, providing them at statistically similar rates as benchmark firms. Overall, the evidence supports concerns that the SPAC merger includes highly optimistic projections.

By circumventing traditional land-use regulations and providing access to underutilized inventory, Airbnb attracts visitors to locales that are not traditional tourist destinations. Although visitors generally bring significant spending power, it is unclear whether visitors use Airbnb primarily for lodging and thus do not contribute to the adjacent economy. To evaluate this, we focus on the impact of Airbnb on the restaurant employment growth across locales in New York City (NYC). Specifically, we focus on areas in NYC that did not attract a significant tourist volume prior to the emergence of a home-sharing service. Our results indicate a salient and economically significant positive spillover effect on restaurant job growth in an average NYC locality. A one-percentage-point increase in the intensity of Airbnb activity (Airbnb reviews per household) leads to approximately 1.7% restaurant employment growth. Since home-sharing visitors are lodging in areas that are not accustomed to tourists, we also investigate the demographic and market-structure-related heterogeneity of our results. Notably, restaurants in areas with a relatively high number of White residents disproportionately benefit from the economic spillover of Airbnb activity, whereas the impact in majority Black areas is not statistically significant. We validate the underlying mechanism behind the results by evaluating the impact of Airbnb on Yelp visitor reviews, revealing that areas with increased Airbnb activity experience a surge in their share of NYC visitor reviews. This result is further validated by evaluating the impact of a unique Airbnb neighborhood-level exogenous policy recently implemented in New Orleans. © 2022 INFORMS","employment growth; racial disparity; sharing economy; spillover effects","Economic and social effects; Employment; Employment growth; Land use regulations; Local service; New York city; Power; Racial disparity; Sharing economy; Sharing platforms; Spillover effects; Tourist destinations; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128854947

To address this historical gap, a notable stream of research on emotions in innovation adoption has emerged in recent years. To enrich our understanding of the psychology of innovation adoption, this paper integrates insights from research on emotions in psychology with a systematic review of the literature on consumer emotions in innovation adoption. Drawing on well-established theories of emotions and decision-making, we derive five fundamental dimensions that help define the role of emotions in the consumer adoption of innovations. A systematic review of existing evidence within the specific field of innovation adoption summarises the existing evidence through the lens of the five dimensions. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, the paper offers a novel perspective that provides a deeper understanding of emotions as a psychological mechanism enabling or impeding innovation adoption.

Adblockers typically negotiate with publishers, allowing some ads to go through in return for a payment, a practice called (partial) whitelisting in the industry. Ad blocking has a direct positive effect on consumers by reducing advertising intensity. On the other hand, the practice clearly hurts publishers and reduces their incentives to invest in content quality. Lower content quality, in turn has an indirect negative effect on consumers. This paper builds an analytic model to explore the net impact of ad blocking on consumers, how it depends on various market characteristics, and how uniformly it affects consumers. The results show that under a broad set of market conditions, total consumer surplus and even total welfare decline under ad blocking. Whereas some consumers are always better off with an ad blocker, for the average consumer, the impact of quality decline is larger than that of ad reduction. The analysis highlights the detrimental role of ad blockers’ current revenue model—in which value is created for the consumers but it is captured from publishers—in decreasing quality, consumer surplus, and total welfare. Analyzing the impact of varying levels of negotiation power between the ad blocker and publisher reveals that full negotiation power is not preferred by the ad blocker. A lower negotiation power allows the ad blocker to commit to less value extraction from the publisher, thereby leading to higher content quality. Additional model extensions show that the main results are robust. In the case of multiple publishers with different levels of competition between them, the strong negative effect of ad blocking on quality holds.

We explore what different stakeholders can do to achieve a more transparent and/or responsible supply chain. We establish that under rather general conditions, the two firms will adopt mixed strategies in equilibrium, a focal case of our analysis. The mixed-strategy results first explain at the micro level why many companies are not certain about whether their supply chains are ethical or not. At the more macro level, they also help explain why a significant proportion of the buyers did not trace or comply with transparency regulations. We then show that more responsible sourcing can be induced by lowering the buyer's tracing cost but not by reducing the supplier's own responsible sourcing cost. We also find that more transparency does not always imply more responsible sourcing. For the external stakeholders, more responsible sourcing may be obtained through lowering tracing costs, improving tracing or public discovery of violations, and imposing more significant reputational damage or penalties only on the buyer. For the internal stakeholders, a contract incorporating both responsible sourcing cost sharing and non-compliance penalty if found may be constructed for the first-best supply chain efficiency and likely social optimality under some simple sufficient conditions. © 2022","Compliance; Game theory; Responsible sourcing; Traceability; Transparency; Visibility","Cost effectiveness; Sales; Supply chains; Transparency; Compliance; Condition; Cost sharing; External stakeholders; Micro level; Mixed strategy; Multi-tier; Reputational damage; Responsible sourcing; Traceability; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126588260

In this regard, this research explores the determinants influencing SCA adoption and the impacts on firm performance and competitive advantage. Specifically, the Technological, Organisational, and Environmental (TOE) framework was applied to identify the key determinants influencing SCA adoption. Data was collected from 217 executives working in the UK manufacturing sector through a questionnaire-based survey. The research model was tested using a quantitative approach, i.e., Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. Surprisingly, none of the identified technological factors leads manufacturing companies to adopt SCA. On the contrary, organisational and environmental factors have a crucial role in influencing supply chain and logistics managers to adopt SCA. This research also emphasises and validates the importance of SCA adoption in improving firm performance and fostering competitive advantage. On evaluating SCA adoption, supply chain managers should concentrate on aspects other than technological competence.

The circular business strategy has increasingly attracted more notice as a proper solution to address the environmental issues and accomplish economic as well as social benefit with the ultimate target of zero-waste. Yet, prior studies failed to determine circular business strategy attributes with the complete viewpoint and adequate measurement under qualitative information. Studies on zero-waste practices from the firm perspective are limited. To fulfill this gap, this study aims to determine the decisive circular business strategy attributes, their interrelationships in view of sustainable balanced scorecard and examine influential zero-waste practices from firm perspective. A combined method, including fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, and Choquet integral is employed. From the original set of attributes, five aspects and 20 criteria are validated. The results present that collaborative circularity, strategic internal process, and technology competency are causal aspects with high involvement among the effect group. The decisive criteria for the seafood processing industry encompass resource consumption minimization, waste minimization, clean technology, by-product marketplace, network development, and coordination upgradation. From initial zero-waste practices of the industry's current status, two critical ones are identified including reuse and recycle. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Choquet integral; Circular business strategy; Collaborative circularity; Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Fuzzy Delphi method; Zero-waste practices","Integral equations; Meats; Strategic planning; Business strategy; Choquet integral; Circular business strategy; Collaborative circularity; Fuzzy Decision making; Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Seafood processing; Zero waste; Zero-waste practice; Decision making; business development; decision making; Delphi analysis; environmental economics; food industry; food processing; industrial performance; seafood; strategic approach; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; waste management; article; balanced scorecard; decision making; Delphi study; human; sea food; uncertainty; Viet Nam; waste minimization; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125434821

This paper presents a mixed-integer programming model to identify the efficient assignment of demand zones (counties) to distribution centers (branches) and equitable allocation of donated food from the food bank branches to the demand zones. The model objective function minimizes the total cost of branch operation, the cost of receiving and distributing food, the cost of undistributed food while maintaining the maximum allowed deviation from perfect equity. Data from the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina (FBCENC) are used to characterize the major attributes controlling the food distribution system of a food bank. Results from the optimization model using FBCENC data show that the optimal allocation under perfect equity follows a particular structure depending on the shipping cost and the cost of undistributed supply. Sensitivity analyses exploring the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness as a function of the cost of shipping, truck capacity, and a user-specified maximum inequity cap show that marginal sacrifice in equity can significantly improve effectiveness. The corresponding improvement in effectiveness is greater when comparatively larger trucks are used and the cost of shipping is relatively higher. The analyses also suggest that while efficiency is less sensitive to the allowable limit on the deviation from perfect equity, it is sensitive to truck size. A comparison of direct shipping to branches to operating a local hub suggests the former option to be more cost efficient. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Donation distribution; Effectiveness; Efficiency; Equity; Food bank; Food insecurity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108830946

The risk and the cost of new energy products are generally higher than those of traditional energy products, which results in conflicting pricing strategies between manufacturers and retailers. Applying the concepts from dynamic cooperative game theory, such as improved Shapley value, in this paper, we have studied the optimal pricing strategies of manufacturers and retailers in a cooperative and a noncooperative game. Based on policies and market conditions in China, we have used a logistic regression model to determine the impact of product sales, devised pricing strategies affected by the relevant government tax, and subsidy policy. The results show that, first, under the basic condition in which the manufacturer obtains profit, the optimal pricing of the retailer in a noncooperative game is more than that in a cooperative game. Second, the differential coefficient of the energy consumption of the two products in the cooperative game is greater than that in the noncooperative game. Third, the cooperative game not only plays an incentivizing role for retailers in setting reasonable prices of new energy products but also encourages manufacturers, producing a greater difference of energy consumption between traditional energy products and new energy products, which further reduces the consumption of new energy products. Finally, the strategies of sharing the green marketing costs by manufacturers and retailers can improve the total profits of the supply chain in addition to their own. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Cooperative game; energy consumption difference; improved Shapley value; logistic regression","Commerce; Energy utilization; Finance; Game theory; Logistic regression; Manufacture; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Cooperative game; Games; Government; Green products; Shapley value; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065993092

Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.

A key assumption of the AMH is that the dynamics of competition and natural selection will drive ‘noise traders’, those least likely to push prices to efficient levels because they follow sub-optimal trading strategies, to exit the market. To test the key assumptions of the AMH, survival analysis is employed to examine the behaviour of retail spread-traders, a group who are widely reported to include many noise traders. Analysis of the trades executed by 5,164 individuals in the period 24th March 2006 to 7th February 2012 found that the least profitable and those who adopted ill-disciplined trading strategies tended to cease trading sooner than others. These findings are consistent with the AMH. However, profitable traders were also found to be more likely to cease trading than the average trader and a V-shaped relationship was found between a trader's Sharpe ratio and their likelihood of ceasing to trade (cf. the average trader). Furthermore, during the financial crisis of 2008–09, the disposition effect of traders and the proportion of noise traders increased and throughout the period of the study, the ill-discipline of new generations of traders increased. The results suggest that the forces underpinning the AMH are complex and the move towards market efficiency may not be as straightforward as some expect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behaviour decision; Financial crisis; Irrational trading; Market efficiency; Survival analysis","Bioinformatics; Costs; Efficiency; Financial markets; Profitability; Behavior decision; Efficient market hypothesis; Financial crisis; Irrational trading; Market efficiency; Most likely; Natural selection; Optimal trading strategy; Survival analysis; Trading strategies; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116285113

This paper takes a machine learning approach and introduces a generative model, causal rule sets (CRS), for interpretable subgroup discovery. A CRS model uses a small set of short decision rules to capture a subgroup in which the average treatment effect is elevated. We present a Bayesian framework for learning a causal rule set. The Bayesian model consists of a prior that favors simple models for better interpretability as well as avoiding overfitting and a Bayesian logistic regression that captures the likelihood of data, characterizing the relation between outcomes, attributes, and subgroup membership. The Bayesian model has tunable parameters that can characterize subgroups with various sizes, providing users with more flexible choices of models from the treatment- efficient frontier. We find maximum a posteriori models using iterative discrete Monte Carlo steps in the joint solution space of rules sets and parameters. To improve search efficiency, we provide theoretically grounded heuristics and bounding strategies to prune and confine the search space. Experiments show that the search algorithm can efficiently recover true underlying subgroups.We apply CRS on public and real-world data sets from domains in which interpretability is indispensable. We compare CRS with state-of-the-art rule-based subgroup discovery models. Results show that CRS achieves consistently competitive performance on data sets from various domains, represented by high treatmentefficient frontiers. Summary of Contribution: This paper is motivated by the large heterogeneity of treatment effect in many applications and the need to accurately locate subgroups for enhanced treatment effect. Existingmethods either rely on prior hypotheses to discover subgroups or greedy methods, such as tree-based recursive partitioning. Our method adopts a machine learning approach to find an optimal subgroup learned with a carefully global objective. Our model is more flexible in capturing subgroups by using a set of short decision rules compared with tree-based baselines.We evaluate ourmodel using a novel metric, treatment-efficient frontier, that characterizes the trade-off between the subgroup size and achievable treatment effect, and ourmodel demonstrates better performance than baselinemodels.

Are competing platforms helped or harmed by platforms’ obtaining access to AVs? Are the humans who participate on the platforms—driver-workers and rider-consumers (hereafter, agents)—collectively helped or harmed by the platforms’ access to AVs? How do the conditions under which access to AVs reduces platform profits, agent welfare, and social welfare depend on the AV ownership structure (i.e., whether platforms or individuals own AVs)? Academic/practical relevance: AVs have the potential to transform the economics of ride-hailing, with welfare consequences for platforms, agents, and society. Methodology: We employ a game-theoretic model that captures platforms’ price, wage, and AV fleet size decisions. Results: We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions under which platforms’ access to AVs reduces platform profit, agent welfare, and social welfare. The structural effect of access to AVs on agent welfare is robust regardless of AV ownership; agent welfare decreases if and only if the AV cost is high. In contrast, the structural effect of access to AVs on platform profit depends on who owns AVs. The necessary and sufficient condition under which access to AVs decreases platform profit is high AV cost under platform-owned AVs and low AV cost under individually owned AVs. Similarly, the structural effect of access to AVs on social welfare depends on who owns AVs.

However, questions about ownership of the sensor data are seen as a key barrier to adoption. We model an after-sales supply chain in which the asset manufacturer provides maintenance and repair services to a customer that operates the asset. The asset condition deteriorates in a stochastic fashion and will eventually fail if not repaired. Methodology/results: We analyze a performance-based contracting problem considering manufacturer maintenance effort (the condition at which preventive maintenance is performed) and customer operating effort (which reduces the rate of condition deterioration). With information asymmetry on the customer’s effort cost, we analyze this contracting problem in a principal-agent model with double moral hazard. In the centralized setting, we establish that the benefit of CM increases and then decreases in the asset’s deterioration rate and that CM may increase or decrease the benefit of customer effort depending on the deterioration rate. In the decentralized setting, we prove that CM always benefits the manufacturer and the supply chain, but it may hurt the customer if the asset reliability is sufficiently high. Managerial implications: These results have important implications for the effect of sensor-data ownership. The manufacturer will adopt CM if it owns the data, but the customer may block CM adoption if it owns the data. We show that this CM adoption barrier can be overcome by the manufacturer offering to pay an appropriate data access fee. However, under this arrangement, the manufacturer may not benefit from a more-effective customer operating effort. We discuss the resulting implication on the manufacturer’s product design and the business model between selling and leasing. © 2022 INFORMS","maintenance; performance-based contracts; repair operations","Condition based maintenance; Deterioration; Manufacture; Preventive maintenance; Product design; Repair; Risk management; Sales; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; After-sales services; Condition; Data ownership; Deterioration rates; Durable assets; Performance-based contracts; Problem definition; Repair operations; Sensors data; Service contracting; Condition monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132226544

To achieve a better delivery time guarantee policy, we study how to estimate and promise delivery time for new customer orders in real time. Academic/practical relevance: Delivery time promising is critical to managing customer expectations and improving customer satisfaction. Simply overpromising or underpromising is undesirable because of the negative impacts on short-/long-term sales. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a data-driven framework to predict the distribution of order delivery time and set promised delivery time to customers in a cost-effective way. Methodology: We apply and extend tree-based models to generate distributional forecasts by exploiting the complicated relationship between delivery time and relevant operational predictors. To account for the cost-sensitive decision-making problem structure, we develop a new split rule for quantile regression forests that incorporates an asymmetric loss function in split point selection. We further propose a cost-sensitive decision rule to decide the promised delivery day from the predicted distribution. Results: Our decision rule is proven to be optimal given certain cost structures. Tested on a real-world data set shared from JD.com, our proposed machine learning–based models deliver superior forecasting performance. In addition, we demonstrate that our framework has the potential to provide better promised delivery time in terms of sales, cost, and accuracy as compared with the conventional promised time set by JD.com. Specifically, our simulation results indicate that the proposed delivery time promise policy can improve the sales volume by 6.1% over the current policy. Managerial implications: Through a more accurate estimation of the delivery time distribution, online retailers can strategically set the promised time to maximize customer satisfaction and boost sales. Our data-driven framework reveals the importance of modeling fulfillment operations in delivery time forecasting and integrating the decision-making problem structure with the forecasting model. © 2022 INFORMS","forecasting; logistics; machine learning; online retail","Cost effectiveness; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; E-learning; Machine learning; Sales; Structural optimization; Cost-sensitive; Customers' satisfaction; Data driven; Decision rules; Decision-making problem; Delivery time; Machine-learning; Online retails; Problem structure; Real- time; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132213657

Thus, the question as to what kind of, and by which mechanisms, team stressors may give rise to better innovation team performance needs further consideration. We address this issue by applying the challenge–hindrance stressor framework to the team level of analysis in the context of innovation teams. By integrating insights from social identity theory and the attentional focus model, we highlight the importance of identity- and information-based mechanisms in transmitting the differential effects of challenge and hindrance team stressors on the performance of innovation teams. We test our arguments for two of the most prominent indicators of innovation team performance (i.e., team creativity and team efficiency) in a multi-informant sample of team members, team-internal leaders, and team-external managers from 114 innovation teams. Our findings support the opposing effects of challenge and hindrance team stressors in predicting innovation team performance through the two differential mechanisms. Specifically, for team efficiency, both team stressors come with the cost of team task conflict (i.e., the information-based mechanism). However, whereas challenge team stressors enhance collective team identification (i.e., the identity-based mechanism), hindrance team stressors undermine collective team identification, thereby aggravating their already negative effect on team efficiency. In terms of team creativity, our results suggest that both types of team stressors exert their indirect effects solely via the identity-based mechanism. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

However, previous research suggests that the availability of teleworking may encourage people to move farther from their place of work, creating the risk that longer commutes will offset the benefits of fewer commutes. In addition, teleworking may encourage additional non-work travel by the teleworker, and/or influence the travel behaviour of other household members. These complex interactions make the overall impacts of teleworking difficult to predict. In this context, we use data from the English National Travel Survey to estimate the impact of teleworking on the travel patterns of English households over the period 2005–2019. We compare the number of trips and distance travelled by teleworkers each week with the number of trips and distance travelled by non-teleworkers, controlling for a range of socio-economic, demographic and regional variables. We estimate the impact of teleworking on travel by purpose (commuting, non-work and business) and by mode (car, public transport and active travel) and investigate the impact on the travel patterns of other household members. Our results provide little support for the claim that teleworking reduces travel. Indeed, after controlling for a range of variables, we find that the majority of English teleworkers travel farther each week than non-teleworkers. This results from a combination of longer commutes and additional non-work travel. There appears to be a ‘tipping point’, however. If people telework three or more times a week, their weekly private travel (commuting + non-work) is less than that of non-teleworkers. We also find that the total weekly travel of all household members is greater in households where one member is teleworking, suggesting the presence of intra-household effects that further erode the benefits of fewer commutes. We additionally find that teleworkers engage in more business travel than non-teleworkers, although the reasons for this association are unclear. We discuss the factors contributing to these results and indicate priorities for further research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Complementarity; Induced travel; Rebound effects; Teleworking","Carbon emissions; Complementarity; Household members; Induced travel; National travel surveys; Pollution emissions; Rebound-effect; Teleworkers; Teleworking; Travel patterns; Surveys; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; complementarity; pandemic; survey; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127362501

While OHCs offer a variety of benefits to society, it is challenged by surrounding issues of privacy concerns. Breach of privacy poses undesirable consequences for people, and thus privacy concerns can influence individuals' social support behaviour in OHC platforms. Moreover, willingness to engage in the community can be an outcome of prosocial behaviour, motivating people to offer additional social support on OHC platforms. Hence, addressing the role of engagement in a multi-actor online environment requires further attention. Drawing on social support theory, by examining the effects of privacy concerns, control of information, and community engagement, this study develops a framework to create an informed and sharing online community. Using survey data collected from different OHC platforms on Facebook, our study presents some interesting conclusions.

Traditional traceability systems are centralized, and the data that they use are vulnerable to tampering, resulting in a low level of consumer trust. Blockchain technology, as a distributed ledger, can solve these problems. In this study, we examine the blockchain technology introduction decisions of a supply chain involving two competing manufacturers and a single retailer, and their effects on supply chain performance. We find that manufacturers should adopt blockchain technology only when consumer sensitivity to blockchain technology exceeds a certain level and manufacturers who can introduce blockchain technology first are more likely to reap big gains in profits. Regarding the unit verification fee that the retailer pays to the manufacturer when introducing blockchain technology, the manufacturer subsidizes this fee to the retailer in the form of lower wholesale prices. In other words, there is no additional wholesale cost to the retailer for blockchain technology-based products.

We separate rational ordering in response to increasing incoming orders from irrational ordering. Academic/practical relevance: Prior research has shown that the bullwhip effect occurs in about two-thirds of firms and impacts profitability by 10%–30%. Most bullwhip mitigation efforts emphasize processes such as information sharing, collaboration, and coordination. Previous work has not been able to separate the impact of behavioral ordering from rational increases in order quantities. Methodology: Using data from a laboratory experiment, we estimate behavioral parameters from three ordering models. We use a simulation to evaluate the cost impact of bullwhip behavior on the supply chain and by echelon. Results: We find that cost increases are not equally shared. Human biases (behavioral ordering) at the retailer results in higher relative costs elsewhere in the supply chain, even as similar ordering by a wholesaler, distributor, or factory results in increased costs within that echelon. These results are consistent regardless of the behavioral models that we consider. The cognitive profile of the decision maker impacts both echelon and supply chain costs. We show that the cost impact is higher as more decision makers enter a supply chain. Managerial implications: The cost of behavioral ordering is not consistent across the supply chain. Managers can use the estimation/simulation framework to analyze the impact of human behavior in their supply chains and evaluate improvement efforts such as coordination or information sharing. Our results show that behavioral ordering by a retailer has an out-sized impact on supply chain costs, which suggests that upstream echelons are better placed to make forecasting and replenishment decisions. © 2021 INFORMS","behavioral operations; bullwhip effect; inventory management; simulation; supply chain management","Behavioral research; Costs; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Inventory control; Managers; Supply chain management; Behavioral operations; Bullwhip effects; Cost impact; Decision makers; Human behaviors; Information sharing; Inventory management; Relative costs; Simulation; Supply chain costs; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122836431

However, we show that improving the accuracy of numeric estimates does not necessarily improve the accuracy of decisions. For binary-choice judgments, also known as classification tasks—for example, yes/no or build/buy decisions—social influence is most likely to grow the majority vote share, regardless of the accuracy of that opinion. As a result, initially, inaccurate groups become increasingly inaccurate after information exchange, even as they signal stronger support. We term this dynamic the “crowd classification problem.” Using both a novel data set and a reanalysis of three previous data sets, we study this process in two types of information exchange: (1) when people share votes only, and (2) when people form and exchange numeric estimates prior to voting. Surprisingly, when people exchange numeric estimates prior to voting, the binary-choice vote can become less accurate, even as the average numeric estimate becomes more accurate. Our findings recommend against voting as a form of decision making when groups are optimizing for accuracy. For those cases where voting is required, we discuss strategies for managing communication to avoid the crowd classification problem.

Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 324 management faculty at research, balanced and teaching (i.e. respectively low-, moderate- and high-teaching demands) public universities in the United States. Findings: Results showed that no single job resource predicted research productivity across all three types of schools. At research schools (i.e. low-teaching demands), productivity was positively associated with job resources including summer compensation, level of protection for untenured faculty and number of research assistant hours, while negatively associated with travel funding. At balanced schools (i.e. moderate-teaching demands), research output was positively associated with time allocated to research, grant money, travel funding and conference attendance, while negatively associated with amount of consulting hours. At teaching schools (i.e. high-teaching demands), the only significant resource was time allocated to research. Practical implications: This paper can help management faculty and business school leaders understand what resources are most appropriate given the teaching demands associated with the specific institution, and by further helping these institutions attract and retain the best possible faculty. Originality/value: This study extends prior work on academic research performance by identifying resources that can help faculty publish given different levels of teaching demands. This is important as teaching demands tend to be relatively stable within an institution, while they can vary greatly across types of institutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Demands; Faculty; Management; Research productivity; Resources; Service; Teaching",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117381199

Method: The framework was developed using mixed methods over four phases, including i) a targeted literature review of KT networks, activities and indicators, ii) two scoping reviews to further enhance the set of indicators, iii) peer-reviews by international KT experts and an online expert consultation, and iv) piloting. Results: A comprehensive theory of change (ToC) and indicators, both for the Network Secretariat and its participating member countries, were identified to develop the monitoring and evaluation framework. The framework includes (i) a ToC, including three key indicator domains across the results chain (outputs, short term outcomes, intermediate outcomes), and (ii) indicators for the three key domains, that can be selected depending on the stage of network maturity, along with suggested data collection methods. The three key indicator domains are 1) KT capacity and skill building; 2) network (structure, governance and leadership); and 3) KT/evidence-informed policy value and culture. Conclusion: The monitoring and evaluation framework that links KT activities with policy and health outcomes fills an important gap in optimizing KT procedures, generating lessons learned and increasing accountability of major multipartner KT networks. © 2022","Evidence-informed policy; Knowledge translation; Monitoring and evaluation framework; Network","conceptual framework; governance approach; knowledge based system; literature review; network analysis; policy development; article; consultation; human; leadership; maturity; outcome assessment; peer review; skill; theoretical study; health care policy; management; program evaluation; Health Policy; Humans; Leadership; Policy Making; Program Evaluation; Translational Research, Biomedical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126133392

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","AI; Digital transformation; Fashion; Instagram; Purchase decision","Behavioral research; Quality control; Sales; Apparel industry; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Fashion; Fashion industry; Instagram; Online social networkings; Perceived quality; Purchase decision; Technological advancement; Social networking (online); artificial intelligence; clothing industry; competitiveness; decision making; social media; technological change; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123988809

The advanced digital technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), and the current COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated the wide application of service robots to provide quality customer experience with limited in-person service encounters. Many of today's service robots perform not only complex services, but they are anthropomorphic with physical and psychological states like humans. This study investigates how the varying degree of anthropomorphism in robots affect customers’ perceived service quality. A research model with associated hypotheses was developed based on affect-as-information theory. The study collected data from 455 randomly selected customers who were served by either a mechanical robot (automatic on-demand coffee maker) or an anthropomorphic robot (travel information assistant). The results of the study showed that anthropomorphism has a significant positive impact on intimacy between robots and humans, intimacy has significant positive impact on customers’ perceived service quality, and intimacy has a mediating role on the relationship between anthropomorphism and service quality. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence (AI); Intimacy; Service quality; Service robots","Anthropomorphic robots; Artificial intelligence; Information theory; Intelligent robots; Sales; 'current; Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence; Digital technologies; Intimacy; Perceived service qualities; Quality customers; Service Quality; Service robots; Service sectors; Quality of service; artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; perception; robotics; service quality; service sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123953711

This absence causes information deficiency and confusion in communication, which, in turn, affects project planning and control, and hinders knowledge sharing and management. This research aims to investigate the obstacles in project execution with the assumption that a decision tree model can map user needs and trace workflows. To understand user needs, we first recorded the focus group discussions followed by semi-structured interviews, then transcribed them into a combined script of 120,000 words. Meanwhile, the prevailing standards of project execution were diagrammed to define ten interconnected categories and derive the workflow schemes to obtain a novel decision tree model, which was used together with the interview data to validate the probabilities and the weighted significance values. The next step was to quantify and prioritize the exact user needs and data specifications of the industry professionals during project execution. After the verification with the invited expert panel, the results show that the most predominant urgencies of time-related risk management are (1) the decision support tools using automated functions to check schedule logic and evaluating risks, (2) preparation assistance for risk communication, and (3) generation of risk mitigation scenarios. The findings can help to line up software development steps for scheduling programs and improve the quality of the risk response strategies for construction projects. One limitation of the current work is the sample size of interviewees, which could be enhanced by designing a questionnaire based on the findings and survey the construction industry. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction schedule; Decision tree; Project execution; Risk assessment; User needs","Construction industry; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Project management; Risk management; Risk perception; Software design; Surveys; Construction schedules; Decision-tree model; Project execution; Project planning and control; Related risk; Risks assessments; Risks management; Unstructured data; User need; Work-flows; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123475281

Many EVM metrics and project duration forecasting methods have been proposed. However, very few studies have compared their accuracy and stability. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents an exhaustive stability and accuracy analysis of 27 deterministic EVM project duration forecasting methods. Stability is measured via Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients while accuracy is measured by Mean Squared and Mean Absolute Percentage Errors. These parameters are determined at ten percentile intervals to track a given project's progress across 4,100 artificial project networks with varied topologies. Findings: Findings support that stability and accuracy are inversely correlated for most forecasting methods, and also suggest that both significantly worsen as project networks become increasingly parallel. However, the AT + PD-ESmin forecasting method stands out as being the most accurate and reliable. Practical implications: Implications of this study will allow construction project managers to resort to the simplest, most accurate and most stable EVM metrics when forecasting project duration. They will also be able to anticipate how the project topology (i.e., the network of activity predecessors) and the stage of project progress can condition their accuracy and stability. Originality/value: Unlike previous research comparing EVM forecasting methods, this one includes all deterministic methods (classical and recent alike) and measures their performance in accordance with several parameters. Activity durations and costs are also modelled akin to those of construction projects. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction projects; Deterministic forecasting; Earned value management; Metrics stability; Project duration; Time estimates accuracy","Budget control; Forecasting; Stability; Topology; Value engineering; Construction project managers; Construction projects; Correlation coefficient; Design/methodology/approach; Deterministic methods; Earned value management; Mean absolute percentage error; Project monitoring and control; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106231451

Among the most promising technologies is CO2 mineralisation in which CO2 is transformed into a thermodynamically stable carbonate. CO2 mineralisation not only offers permanent storage of CO2 but also potentially avoids emissions by partially substituting conventional cement with the obtained carbonation products. Besides overcoming technical barriers, successful development and implementation of CO2 mineralisation require support from key stakeholders. While existing studies already provide technology-related data and assess CO2 mineralisation pathways, knowledge remains scarce about stakeholder priorities and perceptions. Using a multi-stakeholder expert survey, the present study examines: a) the priorities of different stakeholders in supporting CO2 mineralisation, b) their perceptions on the performance of CO2 mineralisation concepts, and c) their priorities if tasked with communicating CO2 mineralisation technologies to other groups. Hereby, we follow a multi-criteria decision analysis approach, based on an analytical hierarchy process, by comparing indicators from the three common sustainability pillars (i.e., environmental, economic, and social impacts). Our results indicate that key stakeholders strongly prioritise the health implications of CO2 mineralisation technologies and generally value social impacts highly. Hence, an in-depth research is needed to provide knowledge-based guidance on health issues and ways to fairly distribute costs and create positive employment outcomes. Additionally, stakeholders of all affiliations give second priority to reducing carbon footprint of cement, showing that they discount potential environmental and economic trade-offs associated with emission reduction goals. The results reveal that these concepts are perceived as compatible with other GHG mitigation approaches, such as carbon capture and storage.

Overall, the results can help investors, managers, and policymakers to ensure that upcoming decisions in R&amp;D, investments, and the design of support mechanisms align with the priorities of key stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach: Data collection was carried out through a multinational survey with 318 respondents from different manufacturing companies located in 15 countries. Multivariate data techniques were applied to analyze the collected data. Diffusion of innovations theory (DIT) was the adopted theoretical lens for our research. Findings: The authors’ findings indicate that I4.0 technologies that aim to process information to support decision-making and action-taking directly affect maintenance performance. Technologies oriented to sensing and communicating data among machines, people, and products seem to moderate the relationship between TPM practices and maintenance performance. However, the extent of such moderation varies according to the practices involved, sometimes leading to negative effects. Originality/value: With the advances of I4.0, there is an expectation that several maintenance practices and performance may be affected. Our study provides empirical evidence of these relationships, unveiling the role of I4.0 for maintenance performance improvement. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Empirical study; Industry 4.0; Performance; Total productive maintenance","Behavioral research; Decision making; Maintenance; Surveys; Data collection; Design/methodology/approach; Diffusions of innovation theories; Empirical studies; Maintenance performance; Maintenance practices; Manufacturing companies; Multivariate data; Performance; Total productive maintenance; Industry 4.0",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123359362

The existing literature assumes the availability of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of both the covariates and the response variable. However, such an assumption often becomes restrictive in many real-world applications. By contrast, we consider a fixed-design setting of the covariates, under which neither the response variable nor the covariates have i.i.d. samples. The present study provides a new data-driven distributionally robust framework under a fixed-design setting. We propose a regress-then-robustify method by constructing a surrogate empirical distribution of the noise. The solution of our framework coincides with a simple yet practical method that involves only regression and sorting, therefore providing an explanation for its empirical success. Measure concentration results are obtained for the surrogate empirical distribution, which further lead to finite-sample performance guarantees and asymptotic consistency. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our approach. © 2021 INFORMS","data-driven newsvendor; distributionally robust optimization; quantile prediction; Wasserstein distance","Optimization; Sampling; Conditional quantiles; Covariates; Data driven; Data-driven newsvendor; Distributionally robust optimization; Empirical distributions; Newsvendors; Quantile prediction; Robust optimization; Wasserstein distance; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132770293

Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States","Problem definition: We consider the problem of joint learning and optimization of cyclic pricing policies in the presence of patient customers. In our problem, some customers are patient, and they are willing to wait in the system for several periods to make a purchase until the price is lower than their valuation. The seller does not know the joint distribution of customers’ valuation and patience level a priori and can only learn this from the realized total sales in every period. Academic/practical relevance: The revenue management problem with patient customers has been studied in the literature as an optimization problem, and cyclic policy has been shown to be optimal in some cases. We contribute to the literature by studying this problem from the joint learning and optimization perspective. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that studies online learning and optimization for multiperiod pricing with patient customers. Methodology: We introduce new dynamic programming formulations for this problem, and we develop two nontrivial upper confidence bound–based learning algorithms. Results: We analyze both decreasing cyclic policies and so-called threshold-regulated policies, which contain both the decreasing cyclic policies and the nested decreasing cyclic policies. We show that our learning algorithms for these policies converge to the optimal clairvoyant decreasing cyclic policy and threshold-regulated policy at a near-optimal rate. Managerial implications: Our proposed algorithms perform significantly better than benchmark algorithms that either ignore the patient customer characteristic or simply use the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, which does not encourage enough exploration; this highlights the importance of “smart learning” in the context of data-driven decision making. In addition, our numerical results also show that combining our algorithms with smart estimation methods, such as linear interpolation or least square estimation, can significantly improve their empirical performance; this highlights the benefit of combining smart learning with smart estimation, which further increases the practical viability of the algorithms. © 2021 INFORMS","asymptotic analysis; customer behavior; dynamic programming; nonparametric algorithms; pricing","Asymptotic analysis; Behavioral research; Costs; Decision making; E-learning; Economics; Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Numerical methods; Sales; Customer behavior; Customer valuation; Joint distributions; Joint learning; Joint optimization; Nonparametric algorithms; Online learning; Online optimization; Pricing policy; Problem definition; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131522822

Each type of customer can be serviced using different actions, each of which stochastically consumes some combination of resources and returns different rewards for the resources consumed. We consider a general model in which the resource consumption distribution associated with each customer type–action combination is not known but is consistent and can be learned over time. In addition, the sequence of customer types to arrive over time is arbitrary and completely unknown. We overcome both the challenges of model uncertainty and customer heterogeneity by judiciously synthesizing two algorithmic frameworks from the literature: inventory balancing, which “reserves” a portion of each resource for high-reward customer types that could later arrive based on competitive ratio analysis, and online learning, which “explores” the resource consumption distributions for each customer type under different actions based on regret analysis. We define an auxiliary problem, which allows for existing competitive ratio and regret bounds to be seamlessly integrated. Furthermore, we propose a new variant of upper confidence bound (UCB), dubbed lazyUCB, which conducts less exploration in a bid to focus on “exploitation” in view of the resource scarcity. Finally, we construct an information-theoretic family of counterexamples to show that our integrated framework achieves the best possible performance guarantee. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on both synthetic instances generated for the online matching with stochastic rewards problem under unknown probabilities and a publicly available hotel data set. Our framework is highly practical in that it requires no historical data (no fitted customer choice models or forecasting of customer arrival patterns) and can be used to initialize allocation strategies in fast-changing environments.

Environmentally and financially, it represents a waste of natural resources and increases the cost respectively. Socially, it represents an ethical issue as about 800 million people are suffering from hunger worldwide. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore if and how resilience contributes to food waste reduction in fruits and vegetables distribution in the Brazilian market. Multiple case studies were conducted in the supplier-retailer dyad of four retail chains. Results have shown that resilience plays the role of both enabler and barrier to food waste reduction. On the positive side, collaboration, communication, flexibility, innovation, knowledge management, leadership, security technologies and supply chain design contributed to food waste reduction; especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the negative side, financial health and redundancy increased the level of food waste. Additionally, it was observed that flexibility can reduce or increase food waste. Our findings have implications for academics and practitioners as the developed framework summarizes the role of resilience to food waste reduction. As a social impact, the implementation of food waste reduction initiatives by non-governmental organizations and retailer associations can result in increased communication, knowledge diffusion, and training about how to build resilience and improve food waste reduction practices among different agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that explores the relationship among elements of resilience and food waste. Thus, it advances the current literature by operationalizing resilience to reduce food waste. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Food loss; Food supply chain; Food waste; Resilience; Retail; Waste reduction","Food supply; Knowledge management; Supply chains; Waste management; Ethical issues; Food loss; Food supply chain; Food waste; Fruit and vegetables; Multiple-case study; Resilience; Retail chains; Three dimensions; Waste reduction; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123597878

Based on a study of nearly a million stock-related news articles from the Sina Finance news platform and 12.7 million stock-related social media messages from the popular Weibo platform in China, we find that social media covers less stocks than mass media, and this effect is amplified as the volume of media information increases. We find that there is some short-term predictive value from these sources, but they are different. Although mass media information coverage is more predictive than social media information coverage in a one-day horizon, it is the other way around in a two-to five-day horizon.

It is important to apply appropriate social media promotion in sustainability context to consider different factors that might be overlooked by researchers and practitioners, including the selection of celebrities in the promotion process and the way information is shared. In this paper, we address the question of how companies can achieve better customer perception regarding brand and celebrity promotion of sustainability in social media. Based on a context of plastic waste reduction propaganda, a scenario-based experiment design was employed to analyze data collected from 330 consumers. According to the results of experiments, marketers have been suggested to ensure the level of congruence between celebrity and product is high, and social media messages should be organic to achieve greater customer perceived altruism toward brands and celebrities. An analysis of structural equation models also indicates that the perceived altruism of celebrity mediates the relationship between perceived altruism of brand and intention to share information from social media. By examining the relationships between customer perceptions toward various actors of social media communication, this study contributes to the literature of marketing advertisement in the sustainability context. © 2021","Celebrity endorsement; Content sponsorship; Factorial experiment; Green consumption; Product-celebrity congruence; Sustainability","Commerce; Sales; Social networking (online); Advertizing; Celebrity endorsements; Content sponsorship; Customer perceptions; Factorial experiment; Green consumption; Plastics waste; Product-celebrity congruence; Social media; Waste reduction; Sustainable development; advertising; altruism; consumption behavior; experiment; perception; social media; sustainability; advertising; altruism; article; consumer; factorial design; human; marketing; perception; plastic waste; propaganda; public figure; social media; structural equation modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121008983

Effective loan evaluation can help lenders make informed investment decisions. Existing methods do not consider the return of loans in the core learning stage and thus fail to explore the relationship between the return of loans and their final loan payoff outcomes. In this study, we propose a systematic loan evaluation framework called COst Sensitive Loan Evaluation (COSLE). Specifically, we first develop an instance-aware misclassification cost (IMCO) matrix, which specifies personalized cost for each loan. Then, we present a differential labelling algorithm called DILA cost for assigning node labels and assessing the corresponding cost. By integrating these enhancements into the tree-induction process, we construct a node splitting measurement called COG index. It exploits the relationship between the return information and the final payoff outcome. Additionally, we design the LER evaluation metric to measure the ability of a loan evaluation model to increase the lender's return. Finally, the COSLE is used to improve popular tree models. Extensive experiments based on the Lending Club dataset show that our COSLE can effectively increase the lender's return. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Cost-sensitive classification; Differential labelling node cost calculation; Instance-aware misclassification cost; P2P loan evaluation; Partition-based method","Costs; Forestry; Cost calculation; Cost-sensitive; Cost-sensitive classification; Differential labeling node cost calculation; Evaluation cost; Instance-aware misclassification cost; Labelings; Misclassification costs; P2P loan evaluation; Partition-based method; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120905670

Due to data security concerns, most EOL HDDs are currently shredded (even when still functioning), representing an economic loss. Moreover, raw material extraction linked to the increased demand for storage causes environmental impacts. Besides mitigating the threat posed by sudden restrictions of raw materials, the circular economy (CE) offers to maximize value retention in the economy and reduce the environmental impacts of human activities. Common CE strategies are reusing and recycling products. However, the reuse of hard disk drives is currently burdened by the lack of trust HDD end-users have toward other non-physical means of data removal than shredding. Here, an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach is proposed to explore how techno-economic and social factors affect end-users’ decisions to adopt EOL management practices other than shredding. The proposed method also accounts for data uncertainty by applying a semi-quantitative approach. Results demonstrate how increased green procurement and more robust standards could spur end-users’ trust toward data-wiping technologies. Even when accounting for uncertainty, HDDs’ reuse brings better environmental and economic benefits than HDD shredding followed by material recovery. The semi-quantitative approach proposed in this study could be more universally applied in future ABM, especially given the often-stochastic nature of such models. The developed ABM is also the first to represent several HDD industry stakeholders and demonstrate how the HDD shredding lock-in situation could be resolved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Circular economy; Data quality; e-waste/electronic waste; Hard-disk drives; Theory of planned behavior","Autonomous agents; Economic and social effects; Electronic Waste; Environmental impact; Hard disk storage; Losses; Simulation platform; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Agent-based model; Circular economy; Data quality; Data uncertainty; E-waste/electronic waste; Electronics wastes; End of lives; End-users; Hard Disk Drive; Theory of Planned Behavior; Computational methods; data set; electronic waste; environmental impact; future prospect; uncertainty analysis; waste management; Article; e-waste; environmental economics; environmental impact; information storage; life cycle assessment; quantitative analysis; recycling; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120871743

We provide quantitative evidence for these insights applying dynamic probit and bivariate probit models to a longitudinal dataset of manufacturing firms based in Spain for the period 2007–2016. Our findings confirm the presence of persistence effects in design innovation, offering novel evidence in support of the view whereby design is an iterative process shaped by the knowledge generated through firms’ previous engagement with design.

The study investigates the female underperformance hypothesis in a cross-country analysis of Schumpeterian entrepreneurs. Next, it investigates if there is a gendered dimension of Schumpeterian firm contribution to economic growth. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes both nonparametric and parametric methodologies. Through nonparametric methods, the success of female-owned and male-owned firms is compared. Next, a parametric ordinary least squares regression model tests if there is a gendered nature of an entrepreneurial firm's economic contribution. Findings: In nonparametric analyses, female-owned entrepreneurial firms in developed countries perform similarly to male-owned firms, while in developing countries male-owned firms significantly outperform female-owned firms. The author also finds strong evidence that the gender of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur does not matter in the contribution in economic growth. Research limitations/implications: In all countries, the number of female-owned entrepreneurial firms was significantly lower than that of male-owned firms. The findings point to consistent cultural barriers for women in innovation-related fields and persistent gendered norms in entrepreneurship. Thus, removal of cultural barriers and continued support for Schumpeterian entrepreneurship will benefit women and contribute to a country's economic growth. Originality/value: The data for this study is a unique utilization of the Enterprise World Survey to identify Schumpeterian entrepreneurial firms.

Two intervention scenarios were compared: one using on-farm interventions typically recommended following visual farm audits (visually-based) and the other using mechanistical understanding of nutrient and sediment losses to water (mechanistically-based). At farm scale, reductions in business-as-usual emissions to water of total phosphorus (TP) and sediment, using both the visually-based and mechanistically-based scenarios, were <5%. These limited impacts highlighted the important role of land drains and the lack of relevant on-farm measures in current recommended advisory lists for the soil types in question. The predicted impacts of both scenarios on free draining soils were significantly higher; TP reductions of ∼9% (visually-based) and ∼20% (mechanistically-based) compared with corresponding respective estimates of >20% and >35% for sediment. Key co-benefits at farm scale included reductions in nitrous oxide emissions and improvements in physical soil quality, whereas an increase in ammonia emissions was the principal trade-off. At landscape scale, simulated reductions in business-as-usual losses were <3% for both pollutants for both scenarios. The visually-based and mechanistically-based scenarios narrowed the gaps between current and modern background sediment loads by 6% and 11%, respectively. The latter scenario also improved the reduction of GWP100 relative to business-as-usual by 4%, in comparison to 1% for the former. However, with the predicted increase of ammonia emissions, both eutrophication potential and acidification potential increased (e.g., by 7% and 14% for the mechanistically-based scenario).

Much of the research related to these domains, however, has two limitations. First, it is removed from an understanding of how effects operate when performance is viewed as a dynamic system, or a construct with inherent feedback loops and a tendency to ebb and flow over time. Second, it focuses on leadership behaviors rather than leadership changes (i.e., experiencing a change in one's supervisor), even though employees in today's workforce often experience the event of having a leader replaced. We extend this literature by establishing and testing a theory of performance system dynamics such that key principles of dynamics regarding performance over time are integrated and tested. Moreover, these two predictors, salesperson goals and leadership changes, are represented as exogenous inputs or shocks. Repeated measures data on sales employees obtained over six months provide evidence of performance system dynamics, reflecting not only patterns of consistency but also responses to external forces. Findings also reveal that company-assigned goals (i.e., quotas) are a significant predictor of effort and performance beyond the employees’ typical behavior and nullify any potential negative impact of leadership changes.

When undertaking an ESV study, the available resources, desired scope, and necessary precision must be considered before determining the most appropriate approach. A broad range of techniques exist to support valuation studies, requiring a range of financial, time, and personnel resources. We surveyed authors that completed 56 responses around valuation studies regarding their total costs (including personnel costs) and the perceived precision of their results. Results show that the perceived precision of their results is statistically significant and increases with the cost of a study (adjusted R2 = 0.29, p = 0.018) and the number of person years required to complete it (R2 = 0.31, p = 0.22). Understanding the trade-offs between the costs of the study and the precision of the results allows policymakers and practitioners to make more informed decisions about which ESV methods are most cost effective for their needs. For example, basic value transfer techniques require minimal resources to implement but lack precision in the final estimates, while integrated modelling techniques provide dynamic, spatially explicit, and more precise estimates but are significantly more expensive and time consuming to implement.

This trend is accompanied by new data protection regulation and the development of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that seek to enable individual control over the processing of personal data. However, a great deal of the data generated within the connected home is interpersonal in nature and cannot therefore be attributed to an individual. The cardboard box study adapts the technology probe approach to explore with potential end users the salience of a PET called the Databox and to understand the challenge of collaborative rather than individual data management in the home. The cardboard box study was designed as an ideation card game and conducted with 22 households distributed around the UK, providing us with 38 participants. Demographically, our participants were of varying ages and had a variety of occupational backgrounds and differing household situations. The study makes it perspicuous that privacy is not a ubiquitous concern within the home as a great deal of data is shared by default of people living together; that when privacy is occasioned it performs a distinct social function that is concerned with human security and the safety and integrity of people rather than devices and data; and that current ‘interdependent privacy’ solutions that seek to support collaborative data management are not well aligned with the ways access control is negotiated and managed within the home. © 2021, The Author(s).","Collaborative data management; Connected home; Databox; Interdependent privacy; Internet of Things; Personal data","Access control; Binary alloys; Data privacy; Information management; Potassium alloys; Uranium alloys; Card games; Cardboard boxes; Collaborative data management; Connected home; Databox; End-users; Individual control; Interdependent privacy; Privacy enhancing technologies; Social function; Internet of things; Boxes; Collection; Control Systems; Data; Management; Protection; Safety; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116643974

Additionally, the DEA models only focus either on input-oriented projection minimizing inputs for an inefficient decision making unit (DMU) while keeping outputs at their maximum level, or output-oriented projection maximizing outputs under the present level of input consumption. To simultaneously deal with input excesses and output shortfalls maximizing both projections, this paper proposes a bi-objective DEA model in the context of undesirable factors and mixed integer requirements. These factors and requirements were integrated into the objective function and constraints of the existing bi-objective models. In addition, the proposed model estimates the returns to scale of DMUs that depends on the projections of input reduction and output augmentation. The applicability and usefulness of the proposed model were tested using the dataset of 39 Spanish airports retrieved from the literature.

However, they unconsciously show different confidence levels in decision-making process because they come from various backgrounds and have different experiences, etc., which affects the decision results. Moreover, the probabilistic linguistic term set, which not only includes the linguistic expressions used by DMs in their daily life but also contains the probability for each linguistic term, can well portray the real perceptions of DMs for the projects. Furthermore, large-scale consensus has gradually been a popular way to effectively solve complex decision-making problems. To sum up, in this paper, we are dedicated to constructing a large-scale consensus model considering the confidence levels of DMs under probabilistic linguistic circumstance. Firstly, the endo-confidence is defined and measured by DM’s probabilistic linguistic information. Then, the DMs are clustered according to the similarities of both evaluation information and the endo-confidence levels. Both evaluation of the non-consensus cluster and evaluation integrated by the clusters with higher endo-confidence level than this non-consensus cluster are used as the reference to adjust its evaluation information. Then, a case study and the comparative analysis are carried out. Finally, some conclusions and future work are given. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although many modeling techniques have been proposed, and a number of different aggregate accuracy metrics exist for evaluating the overall performance of predictive models, other important aspects, such as the reliability (or confidence and uncertainty) of individual predictions, have been underexplored. We propose to use estimated absolute prediction error as the indicator of individual prediction reliability, which has the benefits of being intuitive and providing highly interpretable information to decision makers, as well as allowing for more precise evaluation of reliability estimation quality. As importantly, the proposed reliability indicator allows the reframing of reliability estimation itself as a canonical numeric prediction problem, which makes the proposed approach general-purpose (i.e., it can work in conjunction with any outcome prediction model), alleviates the need for distributional assumptions, and enables the use of advanced, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to learn individual prediction reliability patterns directly from data. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world data sets show that the proposed machine learning-based approach can significantly improve individual prediction reliability estimation as compared with a number of baselines from prior work, especially in more complex predictive scenarios.

With the advancements of virtual telepresence and motion capture technologies, bilateral teleoperation has been tested in precision construction operations, where a human operator can drive the motion of a remote robot with their natural body motions. A significant challenge is that because of the mismatch between robot mechanic design and the human body, such as a different number of joints of a robotic arm and a human arm, the recovered robot motions driven by human hand motions may not be desired, leading to unintended consequences including collision. This study presents a proactive collision avoidance system based on the real-time prediction of human hand motions. The proposed method, Feature-based Human-Motion Prediction (FHMP), stores streaming motion data into a data pool, quantifies the spatiotemporal relationship between gaze focus and hand movement trajectories, and segments and clusters the streaming data into different pattern groups based the motion pattern similarity. Different machine learning (ML) models are trained for each of the pattern groups. During the real-time prediction, whenever a pattern change is detected, the ML model is transitioned to a new model that matches the new pattern. A data buffering approach is used to reuse the old data and old ML model for a certain period of time before the new ML model is well trained, to ensure an uninterrupted real-time prediction of human hand motions. The gaze and hand motion data of a human subject experiment (n=120) for pipe skid maintenance was used to test the system in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The result shows that FHMP can support anticipatory collision avoidance in bilateral teleoperation with a better prediction performance. Future research could enable testing the method on real robots for more believable results. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Collision avoidance; Deep learning; Human motion prediction; Teleoperation","Collision avoidance; Deep learning; Digital storage; Forecasting; Machine design; Motion estimation; Robotics; Robots; Virtual reality; Visual communication; Bilateral teleoperation; Collisions avoidance; Deep learning; Feature-based; Human hand motions; Human motion prediction; Human motions; Machine learning models; Motion prediction; Real-time prediction; Remote control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128943538

We do so by investigating the moderating role of formal workforce training program in a firm and the corruption level and the infrastructural constraint level in the firm’s external environment. Academic/Practical Relevance: Although the adoption of foreign technology by developing economy manufacturing firms is often driven by the goal to strengthen their capabilities in the long run, prior research provides a limited understanding of the performance consequences of technology licensing in the short run, which is an important business reality. Our study serves to address this important gap in research and practice. Methodology: The empirical analyses are conducted using matching and fixed-effects regression on a multi-industry dataset from the World Bank. We analyze detailed firm-level information from over 16,000 manufacturing firms across 25 developing economies in South Asia and East Asia. To strengthen causal inference, our analyses address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. Results: Our results indicate that the adoption of foreign technology by developing economy manufacturing firms has a substantial short-run disruptive effect on firm operations with productivity growth declining by 4.5 percentage points in these firms relative to comparable firms that do not use foreign technology licensing. We find that formal workforce training programs attenuate the negative relationship between technology licensing and productivity growth. However, infrastructural constraints in the external business environment amplify this negative relationship. Intriguingly, our results suggest that corruption in the firm’s external environment acts as an “efficient grease,” attenuating the negative impact of technology licensing on productivity growth. Managerial Implications: Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the disruptive effects of technology licensing on productivity growth in the short run. Furthermore, these results offer insights for manufacturing firms and policymakers in developing economies on how to mitigate these negative effects.

Prior research has shown that when advisors provide numeric probability forecasts, people typically average them (i.e., they move closer to the average advisor's forecast). However, what if the advisors say that an event is ""likely"" or ""probable?"" In eight studies (n = 7,334), we find that people are more likely to act as if they ""count"" verbal probabilities (i.e., they move closer to certainty than any individual advisor's forecast) than they are to ""count"" numeric probabilities. For example, when the advisors both say an event is ""likely,"" participants will say that it is ""very likely."" This effect occurs for both probabilities above and below 50%, for hypothetical scenarios and real events, and when presenting the others' forecasts simultaneously or sequentially. We also show that this combination strategy carries over to subsequent consumer decisions that rely on advisors' likelihood judgments. We discuss and rule out several candidate mechanisms for our effect. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

To assess if the hype is warranted, we use data from the film industry in simulation experiments that contrast econometric approaches with tools from the predictive analytics literature. Further, we propose new strategies that combine elements from each literature in a bid to capture richer patterns of heterogeneity in the underlying relationship governing revenue. Our results demonstrate the importance of social media data and value from hybrid strategies that combine econometrics and machine learning when conducting forecasts with new big data sources. Specifically, although both least squares support vector regression and recursive partitioning strategies greatly outperform dimension reduction strategies and traditional econometrics approaches in forecast accuracy, there are further significant gains from using hybrid approaches. Further, Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that these benefits arise from the significant heterogeneity in how social media measures and other film characteristics influence box office outcomes. © 2021 INFORMS","Big data; Heteroskedasticity; Machine learning; Model specification; Movies; Social media","Economics; Forecasting; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Social networking (online); Statistics; Commercial applications; Data-source; Film industry; Forecast accuracy; Heteroskedasticity; Hybrid strategies; Least squares support vector regression; Model specifications; Social media; Social media datum; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124196652

Considering three Industry 4.0 technologies—big data analytics and cloud computing, track and tracing, and simulation and modeling software—we identify the opportunities and challenges that emerge in the context of managing supply chain relationships. This study uses data from an international survey to test how these three Industry 4.0 technologies increase visibility and integration between buyers and suppliers and how they impact supply chain performance. Our results show mixed evidence: although all three technologies directly improve supply chain performance, big data analytics and cloud computing and simulation and modeling also fully support collaborative supply chain models, while track and tracing tools create more visible supply chains but are detrimental to obtaining higher process integration with suppliers. Surprisingly, buyer-supplier collaboration, in terms of visibility and integration, matters more than the technologies themselves. © Copyright © 2021, Innovation Research Interchange.","Buyer-supplier relationship; Digital technologies; Industry 4.0; Supply chain","Big data; Cloud computing; Computer software; Data Analytics; Industry 4.0; Sales; Visibility; Business leaders; Buyer-supplier integrations; Buyer-supplier relationships; Cloud-computing; Data clouds; Digital technologies; New business models; Simulation and modeling; Supply chain performance; Three industries; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122356952

In this research, we develop a framework based on scenarios designed for collaborative supply chains and then suggest novel models of lateral collaboration to optimise 3BL sustainability-related objectives. We propose a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming model and investigate two collaboration scenarios and four cost-sharing strategies with which such collaboration would be likely to succeed. The proposed framework allows for optimal decision-making in multiple sustainable supply chains, simultaneously minimising total costs and environmental impacts as well as maximising social responsibility. Our research provides evidence that lateral collaboration enables optimal decisions and shows how the total cost is shared among network members to obtain profitable and sustainable solutions.

The granularity of these decisions lead to different forecast requirements. For example, inventory replenishment decisions require forecasts at the individual SKU level over lead time, whereas forecasts at higher levels, over longer horizons, are required for supply chain strategic decisions. The most accurate forecasts are not always obtained from data at the 'natural' level of aggregation. In some cases, forecast accuracy may be improved by aggregating data or forecasts at lower levels, or disaggregating data or forecasts at higher levels, or by combining forecasts at multiple levels of aggregation. Temporal and cross-sectional aggregation approaches are well established in the literature. More recently, it has been argued that these two approaches do not make the fullest use of data available at the different hierarchical levels of the supply chain. Therefore, consideration of forecasting hierarchies (over time and other dimensions), and combinations of forecasts across hierarchical levels, have been recommended. This paper provides a comprehensive review of research dealing with aggregation and hierarchical forecasting in supply chains, based on a systematic search. The review enables the identification of major research gaps and the presentation of an agenda for further research. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aggregation; combination; forecasting; hierarchies; Supply chain","Supply chain management; Combination; Demand forecast; Demand forecasting; Forecast accuracy; Hierarchical approach; Hierarchical level; Hierarchy; Inventory replenishment; Leadtime; Strategic decisions; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121300349

However, in the growing literature on offsite manufacturing (OSM), such debates are lacking and some studies conflate different components of research methodologies such as research design, methods, data sources, data types, and analytical techniques. This study examines the components of research methodologies reported in the OSM literature and how they compare with the established relationships between the key components of research methodologies. We analyse 74 articles on OSM sampled from 26 journals and find that quantitative methods, case studies, primary data, bibliometric database and modelling are the most preferred methodological approaches. The methodological components reported also cohere with established relationships between components of research methodology, other than the relationship between research methods and data sources. The findings reveal a growing hybridisation of research designs, data sources and analytical techniques, which suggests that methodological plurality is emerging in the OSM literature. This re-echoes concerns regarding the dominance of quantitative methods and the limited use of theory in CEM research, and consequently highlights the need for diversity in methodologies to expand knowledge boundaries. © 2021 The Author(s).

Across major purchasing and supply management (PSM) research streams, surprisingly few empirical studies explicitly address social desirability bias (SDB), despite SDB constituting a potentially limiting factor. With regard to surveys and behavioral experiments as two of the most widely used empirical methods in PSM, SDB can represent a critical issue. A first step should therefore be to collect and fully report data on SDB in all such studies. The present note then continues by providing an overview of methodological considerations for PSM researchers to mitigate social desirability issues before they arise in their surveys and behavioral experiments. We describe eight potential mitigation approaches, namely disguising the study's research purpose, assuring anonymity and confidentiality, indirect questioning, adapting the wording of single items, broadening response modes, conducting preparatory cognitive interviews, using multiple sources, and applying multiple research methods. In describing this repertoire of preventive measures, we point authors and review teams to both the broader methodological literature and PSM studies that have used such approaches. © 2021 The Authors","Behavioral experiments; Social desirability bias; Surveys",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120699716

This paper looks at potential sources of ‘crowding out’ as well as ‘crowding in,’ and compares standard analysis with a ‘contribution good’ model of science. Two different policy issues are identified – the assembly of ‘critical mass’ for the ‘kick starting’ of commercial science, and the expansion of commercial science beyond its ‘private equilibrium’. We analyse the allocation of scarce business as well as scientific skills between sectors. The model produces regions of both crowding in and out. The latter dominates for very high wages in the public sector as the government deprives the private sector of the means to exploit new knowledge. © 2021","Crowding out; Entrepreneurship; Science; Spillover; Tacit knowledge","Crowding out; Economic theories; Entrepreneurship; External benefits; Government supports; High rate; Private sectors; Science; Spillover; Tacit knowledge; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117684052

This paper proposes a novel design framework that uses Federated learning-Artificial intelligence (FAI) for decision-making and Smart Contract (SC) policies for process execution and control in a completely automated smart automobile manufacturing industry. The proposed design introduces a novel element called Trust Threshold Limit (TTL) that helps moderate the excess usage of embedded equipment, tools, energy, and cost functions, limiting wastages in the manufacturing processes. This research highlights the use cases of AI in decentralised Blockchain with smart contracts, the company’s trading policies, and its advantages for effectively handling market risk assessments during socio-economic crisis. The developed model supported by real-time cases incorporated cost functions, delivery time and energy evaluations. Results spotlight the use of FAI in decision accuracy for the developed smart contract-based Automobile Assembly Model (AAM), thereby qualitatively limiting the threshold level of cost, energy and other control functions in procurement assembly and manufacturing.

Digitisation has made its mark in different areas of manufacturing, from digital materials and processes to data science in decision-making. The digital manufacturing is evolving towards universal manufacturing that is highlighted in this paper. Different manufacturing initiatives are benchmarked and their relationship to universal manufacturing is demonstrated. The representation of enterprises in the universal manufacturing cloud is discussed. Product- and process-based specifications of digital enterprises are defined. Using these specifications, the enterprise configuration algorithm proposed in the paper is applied for the selection of component models. Two different representations, a node–node and an input–output matrix, of the digital component models are considered.

Taking Human Factor (HF) aspects into consideration when making P&L system design and management decisions is therefore important, an ignorance of HF potentially resulting in operator fatigue, discomfort, subsequent injuries and negative consequences for operator performance and the P&L system. A review of the literature shows that the majority of studies that take HF into consideration focus either on designing the workplace or on operation planning activities. There is also still a gap in the literature. Little has been published on P&L systems that incorporate HF and that combine different levels of short-term operational policy decisions (e.g. job allocation) and long-term system characteristic decisions (e.g. layout design). Current state-of-the-art frameworks that support the design and management of P&L systems and that take HF into consideration rarely consider different decision levels. This study proposes a new framework that incorporates HF into P&L systems by combining different levels of decisions to improve performance, quality, and well-being. © 2021 The Author(s).

We build on theory that presupposes that the information disclosed by a firm about its innovation activities will reduce information risk of investors. However, we contend that disclosure of exploration and exploitation innovation activities could convey potentially paradoxical expectations about a firm's future value. Based on longitudinal data of the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2011–2016, we show that firms tend to disclose more information related to exploration than exploitation. However, the bulk of market benefits are driven by exploitation rather than exploration disclosures—except for R&D-active firms that are rewarded for exploration disclosure. We also find that the combined disclosure is negatively associated with cost of equity capital, with the sub-population of R&D-active firms particularly accruing synergies from combined disclosure of both exploration and exploitation. These findings suggest that the market differentiates between exploration and exploitation information in addressing information risk, more so than previously assumed. We discuss implications for information-type-dependency in information-risk theory, the outward projection of internal paradoxes, capital market valuations of disclosure by R&D-active firms, opportunity-seeking by large publicly listed corporations, and policy implications. © 2021","Ambidexterity; Content analysis; Cost of capital; Disclosure; Exploitation; Exploration; Information risk; Innovation; Paradox; R&D","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Investments; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Ambidexterity; Content analysis; Cost of capital; Disclosure; Exploitation; Exploration and exploitation; Information risk; Innovation; Paradox; R&D; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116584621

In addition, we examine the effects of several financial, economic and cryptocurrency specific predictors on the cryptocurrency return series. Our results indicate that the non-homogeneous hidden Markov (NHHM) model with four states has the best one-step-ahead forecasting performance among all competing models for all three series. The dominance of the predictive densities over the single regime random walk model relies on the fact that the states capture alternating periods with distinct return characteristics. In particular, the four state NHHM model distinguishes bull, bear and calm regimes for the Bitcoin series, and periods with different profit and risk magnitudes for the Ether and Ripple series. Also, conditionally on the hidden states, it identifies predictors with different linear and non-linear effects on the cryptocurrency returns.

However, prices of different assets (stocks) may have non-linear relationships which may be quantified using information based measures such as mutual information (MI). To estimate the empirical mutual information between time series of stock returns, we employ a novel kernel density estimator (KDE) based jackknife mutual information estimation (JMI), and compare it with the widely-used binning method. We then propose an average distance gradient change algorithm and an algorithm based on the average silhouette criterion that use pairwise and groupwise MI of high-frequency financial stock returns.

An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making.

We find that stronger intellectual property (IP) protection has a sharper impact on the demand for managerial skill for technologically advanced firms. Firms that were a-priori above the industry median (in terms of technology adoption, more so for R&D expenditure) witness a rise in the share of managerial compensation by 1.3%–8.3% higher than the rest. This effect is completely driven by firms between 5–8th decile with no effect on firms below the median or at the very top of the technological ladder. This observed “snail-shape” in the firms’ response to the IP shock is rationalized in a model where firms within an industry compete for patents by investing in managerial inputs. The observed increase in wage inequality can partly be attributed to a stronger performance pay for high-tech firms. Associatedly, high-tech firms invested more in technology adoption, started to produce more product varieties at higher quality, and filed for more product patent claims. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","High-tech and low-tech firms; Intellectual property regimes; Managerial compensation; Patent race; Wage inequality; “Snail-shape”","high technology industry; incentive; industrial performance; innovation; intellectual property rights; management; skilled labor; wage gap",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112569868

Despite their positive correlation, I theorize contrasting effects of income and education on firms' variety-enhancing spanning. Specifically, I propose that the strong purchasing power of high-income communities should reduce the need for firms to operate in multiple categories, but culturally omnivorous preferences among educated elites should encourage firms' spanning. Analyses of 6,072 restaurants in a metropolitan area and a large-scale survey offer support for these predictions. Education, though not income, has a further positive effect on firms' atypicality-enhancing spanning. This study contributes to category and management research by focusing on audience heterogeneity as important antecedents of firms' action and explicating the multifaceted nature of spanning. Managerial Summary: This study examines how restaurants decide their culinary categories and menus depending on residents' income and education levels of a city they are located in. I find restaurants in higher-income communities tend to be more specialized in a single or fewer categories while those in lower-income communities are more likely to diversify into multiple categories to reach a broader customer base. By comparison, restaurants in more educated communities tend to diversify into multiple categories and provide fusion food because educated cultural omnivores like to explore novelty. These findings imply that retail firms should consider the separate effects of income and education levels of target consumers in determining their business scope and product portfolio. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","category spanning; community analysis; demand-side strategy; quantitative analysis; restaurant industry","Management; Planning; Consumer education; Large scale surveys; Management research; Metropolitan area; Positive correlations; Product portfolios; Purchasing power; Separate effects; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111716038

We argue that the HHs approximation can be estimated using a fixed endogenous determined partitioning of the input space. Assuming a homothetic production function allows us to separate the S-shape scaling law and the underlying core function. We propose an estimation procedure where two HHs function approximations of the core function and the scaling law are estimated simultaneously. A closed form expression of the inverse of the piecewise linear inverse scaling law is proposed and proved. We stress the known result that the HHs formulation is equivalent to the Canonical Piecewise-Linear representation of a piecewise linear function and exploit the result that the HHs formulations for the core function and for the scaling law provide global representations of all piecewise linear functional forms.

The algorithmic harm experienced by individuals, communities and society-at-large involves new injustice claims and disputes that go beyond issues of social justice. Drawing from the theory of “abnormal justice” in this paper we articulate a new theory of algorithmic justice that addresses the questions: WHAT is the matter of algorithmic justice? WHO counts as a subject of algorithmic justice? HOW are algorithmic justices performed? and How to address and resolve disputes about the WHAT, WHO and HOW of algorithmic justice? We illustrate the theory of algorithmic justice by drawing from a case of AADM in social welfare services, widely adopted by governments around the world. Our research points to datafication, technological inscribing and the systemic nature of injustices as important IS-specific aspects of algorithmic justice. Our main practical contribution comes from the articulation of algorithmic justice as a framework that (1) makes visible the injustices related to the “what”, “who”, and “how” of AADM in transformative services, and (2) provides further insights into how we might address and resolve these algorithmic injustices. © Operational Research Society 2021.","datafication; Harmful effects of automated algorithmic decision-making; Patrick Mikalef, Aleš Popovic, Jenny Eriksson Lundström and Kieran Conboy; systemic algorithmic injustices; technological inscribing; theory of algorithmic justice","Information systems; Counts-as; New theory; Social consequences; Social justice; Social welfare; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108435813

This model is naturally associated with sports in which the restart alternates following a goal. The model is a challenger to the Poisson-match, a pair of independent Poisson random variables whose means are related to the strengths of the competing teams. We use the binomial-match primarily to study the relationship between outcome uncertainty and scoring-rate, particularly for high values of the scoring-rate. Netball has a high scoring-rate and motivates our model development. In the binomial-match framework, we also evaluate rule-variations, and study tactical play in netball. Our analysis suggests that the binomial-match is not a better forecaster than the Poisson-match, but it is better for representing outcome uncertainty and evaluating rule-variations and tactics. In general, we find that the binomial-match implies greater outcome uncertainty than the Poisson match, for a given scoring-rate, and that an alternating-restart is a good rule for reducing the frequency of tied outcomes. For netball in particular, we show that starting the final quarter with possession in a close, balanced match may confer a significant advantage. © Operational Research Society 2021.","competitive balance; forecasting; netball; outcome uncertainty; sport; tactics","Uncertainty analysis; Bivariate; Model development; Poisson random variables; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108296440

To avoid such a contradictory phenomenon, this study presents an approximate transitivity-based consistency threshold for reciprocal preference relations to ensure the reliability of the ranking of alternatives with reciprocal preference relations in group decision making. The natural inconsistency or intransitivity of reciprocal preference relations is analyzed and verified by numerical experiments. Then, using the results of numerical experiments, approximate transitivity-based consistency thresholds are introduced based on the objectives of minimising the Type I error, Type II error and total error in statistics. Moreover, a transitivity checking process regarding individual reciprocal preference relations and group reciprocal preference relations is incorporated in the group decision-making process. A transitivity-checking integrated group decision-making model is given for application.

We incorporate the short-term and long-term memory of the investor, thus recasting the behavioural portfolio choice process in a dynamic setting. We evaluate the out-of-sample performance of a behavioural investor in relation to both a naïve investor who invests in an equally weighted portfolio and a rational investor, who maximises expected mean-variance utility. We report a number of findings. First, from an expected utility perspective, neither the rational investor nor the CPT investor achieves a risk-adjusted return or certainty equivalent return that significantly outperforms that of the naïve investor. Second, from a CPT utility perspective, the behavioural investor outperforms both the rational and naïve investors. Third, the CPT investor typically displays highly concentrated, lottery-like asset allocations, low turnover and highly stable portfolio allocations. Fourth, the addition of the investor's memory into the portfolio choice process increases both diversification and turnover, leading to improved investment performance. Finally, by allocating more weight to positively skewed assets and increasing portfolio concentration, the probability weighting function has more impact than the utility function on the behavioural investor's performance. Our results are robust to the choice of reference return, estimation sample size, probability estimates, the probability weighting function and portfolio weight constraints. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioural finance; Cumulative prospect theory; Investor memory; Naïve investment strategy; Portfolio optimisation","Investments; Probability; Behavioural finances; Choice process; Cumulative prospect theory; Investor memory; Naive investment strategy; Performance; Portfolio choice; Portfolio optimization; Probability weighting; Weighting functions; Financial data processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106947733

Decisions regarding product variety, module combinations, and configurations for personalised modules need to be coordinated with the decisions of manufacturing process and supplier selection when developing personalised product architectures. Conventionally, product architecture, processes, and suppliers are independently determined at different product development stages. However, this sequential design process lacks connection between product architecture, process, and supplier, and may lead to suboptimal or even infeasible design solutions with compromised performance. In this study, a concurrent optimisation approach is proposed to integrate manufacturing process and supplier selection into personalised product architecture design. A cost model is developed as a nexus of product architecture, process, and supplier. Then, a mixed-integer optimisation model is established to maximise the potential profit of a product family based on a profit formulation that incorporates customer preference, process resource, supplier, and manufacturing cost. A genetic algorithm is utilised to solve this optimisation problem. The method is demonstrated on the architecture design for a family of personalised bicycles. The result shows that concurrent optimisation can achieve design solutions with higher profitability compared to sequential design strategies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","concurrent engineering; customer preference; Personalisation; process planning; product architecture; supply chain coordination","Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Profitability; Architecture designs; Customer preferences; Manufacturing process; Optimisation models; Optimisation problems; Product architecture; Product development stages; Supplier selection; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102302928

We present a case study in credit card fraud detection using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic samples, with explicit consideration given to customer distributions. We investigate two different cooperating party scenarios yielding four distinct customer distributions by credit quality. Our findings indicate that institutions skewed towards higher credit quality customers are more likely to benefit from augmentation with GANs. Relative gains from synthetic data transfer, in the absence of feature set heterogeneity, also appear to asymmetrically favour banks operating on the lower end of the credit spectrum, which we hypothesise is due to differences in spending behaviours. © Operational Research Society 2022.","distributional analysis; fraud detection; generative adversarial networks; machine learning; Synthetic data; transfer learning","Crime; Data transfer; Sales; Adversarial networks; Cooperating parties; Credit card fraud detections; Customer distribution; Customer privacy; Data augmentation; Model performance; Potential benefits; Data communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101869060

The search strategy resulted in 284 resources. Three dimensions of neoliberal approaches to PPAs emerged from the data each highlighting specific vulnerabilities: a loss of the social embeddedness of nature; an imposition of global, capital dynamics; and conflicting discourses and assumptions. Results suggest that, in order to improve long-term support and integration of PPAs and NBT, greater attention needs to be given to social well-being outcomes (including equity and justice concerns), building of social capital, and the preservation of local identities and histories.

Importantly, effective coordination and collaboration are facilitated by big data and modern information processing (BDMIP) systems that are complex and interlocked with contemporary information and communication technology (ICT). This study simplifies BDMIP systems by using a comprehensive methodology (literature review and a multi-criteria decision-making approach, called the analytic network process) and explores its key determinants and other interconnected factors. The data were collected from humanitarian managers, working in horizontally (e.g. governments, local and international humanitarian organisations) and vertically (e.g. supply chain partners) collaborated organisations. Three systems (manual, semi-automated, and fully automated) are investigated, which depend on various determinants for operational excellence interlinked with modern big data technology and its components. The results indicate that dynamic compatibility is the most important determinant for such systems to support operational excellence, followed by real-time response, cost, end-to-end visibility, and operational service quality. The implementation of fully automated systems is less cost-effective. This attributes to contemporary dimensions and enablers (e.g. the internet of things, big data collection and analytics, effective data and information sharing, modern unmanned aerial vehicles (called drones), skills for mining structured and unstructured data, among others). Semi-automated systems are also imperative for certain enablers (e.g. data accuracy, data reliability, and personalised data exchange).

However, little works have been paid to determining predictors for enterprise survival using the feature-rich data as the textual financial reports. Our work proposes new financial sentiment measurements built on top of mining the textual reports using a financial sentiment dictionary and the rule-based sentiment analysis to determine whether the manager’s reflections towards their company’s performance are positive, negative, or neutral in the business and financial context. We examine the effects of the proposed measurements and compare them with other conventional predictors on forecasting the corporate liquidation. We especially emphasise on the predictivity of the textual analysis for credit risk modelling and how the textual-based predictors differ from the traditional predictors in terms of accurateness. Our research, which is carried on a large sample of the US enterprises with company characteristics, financial ratios, and financial sentiment measurements, show that the textual features built on the 10-K filings significantly improve classification performance of the prediction models on all segments including small and medium enterprise (SME), non-SME, and all samples. © Operational Research Society 2022.","Credit scoring; dictionary-based; predictivity; SME; textual analysis","Investments; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Sentiment analysis; Classification performance; Financial performance; Financial reports; Prediction model; Sentiment dictionaries; Small and medium enterprise; Textual analysis; Textual features; Text mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088960165

There are many factors and variables that can impact hospital operating efficiencies. Among them, engaging a distributor or group purchasing organization (GPO) is one method to influence efficiency throughout the entire supply chain. This research investigates the impact of distributors and GPOs on hospital efficiency and profitability. The data from the 2015 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Hospital Survey of which 6251 hospitals participated are used. These hospitals were separated by those who purchased supplies through a distributor and those who did not. Likewise, the same was performed for those hospitals that used GPO and those that did not. This study employs DEA-Solver software to develop four types of bilateral DEA models. The results of the DEA model use a ranking variable (rank sum) to rank the variables within the two groups (distributor and no distributor) to determine if there is a significant difference between distributor and nondistributor. The same is performed for GPO and non-GPO. We examined the impact of the several control variables on hospital efficiency for distributors and GPOs. Results indicate that the control variables (region, education, profit/nonprofit, government/nongovernment, and system/nonsystem) made a significant difference for hospitals that used a distributor and a GPO.

Extreme positivity bias in reviews makes the review system meaningless, misleads the public, deteriorates users' trust in the sharing platform, and negatively influences consumers' participation on the platform. Considerable anecdotal evidence shows that privacy concerns are a barrier to providing honest negative reviews. However, research studies on the consumers' impact of privacy concerns on review behaviors are sparse. This study aims to fill the gap by investigating consumers' privacy concerns in writing negative reviews. Specifically, this study examines the effects of two types of privacy concerns, online privacy concerns and physical privacy concerns, on the intention to provide negative reviews and contingent factors (monetary incentive, venting negative feelings, and warning other consumers) that could influence this relationship. The study also examines the effectiveness of two fair information practices (i.e., privacy policy and anonymous feature) in mitigating privacy concerns.

Complaints may arise directly from adverse reactions to innovative services or indirectly from service failures where firms over-prioritise innovation. Our empirical analysis focuses on legal services in England and Wales. Survey data on innovation by legal service providers is matched with complaints data from the Legal Ombudsman for England and Wales. This allows us to identify the links between innovation activity and subsequent customer complaints. Our analysis reveals that higher levels of innovation activity increase the probability and number of consumer complaints. We identify how firms can reduce the potential for consumer complaints by adopting collaborative innovation strategies. In addition, firms with international competitors are less likely to face complaints.

The empirical investigation confirms the importance of considering how to manage these predictions in the evaluation phase and demonstrates how the choice may sway overall accuracy measures and bias the results of model performance.

As CNLS has excellent properties in terms of approximating arbitrary monotone concave functions, we use it, along with flexible formulations of productivity, to estimate inefficiency and productivity growth in Chilean manufacturing plants. Inefficiency and productivity dynamics are explored in some detail along with marginal effects of contextual variables on productivity growth, inputs, and output. Additionally, we examine the causal structure between inefficiency and productivity as well as model validity based on a causal deconfounding approach.

While installation costs for offshore wind are higher than many other sources of low carbon energy, the relative increase in capacity factor from onshore leads to higher energy yields, meaning that the unit cost or the levelised cost of energy for offshore wind is becoming increasingly competitive. In this study, a methodology is defined for modelling ranges of levelised cost for offshore wind, analysis shows the mean values of levelised cost of offshore wind in Ireland could be as low as 122 €/MWh. However, when variables such as capital expenditure, cost of finance, variable capacity factors and commodity price shifts are considered, simulations show a large range in potential outcomes, with approximately 60% of the scenarios falling between 108 €/MWh to 137 €/MWh. The methodology and results assist decision making for investment purposes, and in determining the level of support required for offshore wind energy in Ireland.

Whilst mainly developed conceptually and implemented in Europe and North America, marine zoning is becoming a popular tool for addressing diverse coastal marine issues in the tropics. However, we know little about how it is being implemented in practice in that context. In this study, we analysed the factors and strategies that enable and hinder the establishment of marine zoning in the low-income tropics through a case study of the 26-year history of the development of the Environmental Critical Areas Network (ECAN) in Palawan, Philippines. We employed two participatory methods: Innovation Histories to investigate how implementation barriers and opportunities change over time, and the Net-Map method to reveal the social relations and power distributions that enabled, blocked, and stalled its implementation. We found that MSP can be durable in these contexts when institutionalised in national law and adopted by local co-coordinative bodies, yet it remains an externally-driven agenda. Our study shows that the scaling up of zoning does not necessarily help resolve conflicts around marine and coastal space, and highlights the importance and influence of the political economy on MSP implementation and outcomes. We conclude that MSP's insensitivity to contextual power relations and politics raises concerns over social inclusivity, equity and justice. Moving forward, MSP implemented in the tropics needs to make conflicts, trade-offs and power distributions explicit at the outset through participatory decision-making that involves and empowers all stakeholders from the early stages of initiatives. © 2022 The Authors","Marine spatial planning; Marine zoning; Participation; Political economy","coastal zone management; decision making; marine environment; marine policy; participatory approach; political economy; spatial planning; zoning policy; Mimaropa; Palawan [Mimaropa]; Palawan [Palawan (PRV)]; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137058987

Often, online customers underrate product quality due to a lack of firsthand (touch-and-feel) experience, while retail (offline) customers not only experience the product at the stores but also enjoy retail services. In a dual-channel supply chain, we investigate a new role of free-riding under which online customers improve their perception of product quality and explore its effect on product quality and retail service level decisions. We analytically derive equilibrium product quality, retail service level, and pricing strategies in both the centralized and decentralized supply chains. Free-riding not only improves online customers’ perception of product quality but could also induce the manufacturer to improve product quality in both centralized and decentralized models. Although free-riding can lower the level of retail services in the decentralized model, it can produce higher retail services in the centralized model when the degree of free-riding is higher. We develop an effective contract to coordinate the decentralized supply chain, which allows the manufacturer and retailer to share not only the profits from both channels but also the costs of product quality and retail services. Additionally, we extend the study to incorporate demand disruptions into the model and examine their impact. © 2022","Dual-channel supply chains; Free-riding; Product quality perception; Retail services; Supply chain coordination contracts","Costs; Quality control; Retail stores; Supply chains; Dual-channel supply chains; Free-riding; Offline; Online customers; Product quality perception; Products quality; Quality perceptions; Retail services; Supply chain coordination; Supply chain coordination contract; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136097569

This feature significantly influences the innovation process which fact calls for selected explorations disentangling the behavioural aspects of socioeconomic and ecological features associated with energy policy. Such an inquiry has the purpose to detect energy efficiency characteristics connected with renewable energy innovation, pollutants and their contribution to enhancing resilience in developing countries. This returns important information on human behaviour related to energy use and policy interventions. To reach these goals, non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is exploited along with the Tobit model. Energy policy and sustainable development data are scrutinised for a total of 148 developing and transition economies. It thus emerges that the innovation in renewable energy improves efficiency, acting on the resilience of the analysed countries. Renewable energy improve the energy efficiency performance both in the case of carbon emissions and particulates. These outcomes clarify the possible role of energy transition and innovation in less industrialised countries. This finding seems to suggest important environmental implications for energy policy modelling. © 2022","Dea; Developing countries; Electricity vulnerability; Energy efficiency; Energy resilience; Energy transition; Energy use; Human behaviour; Pollutants; Renewable energy innovation; Sustainable development; Transition economies","Behavioral research; Data envelopment analysis; Developing countries; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Planning; Pollution; Dea; Electricity vulnerability; Energy; Energy resilience; Energy transitions; Energy use; Human behaviors; Pollutant; Renewable energies; Renewable energy innovation; Transition economy; Sustainable development; alternative energy; data envelopment analysis; energy efficiency; energy management; energy market; energy policy; energy use; innovation; sustainable development; vulnerability; article; carbon emission; developing country; economic aspect; electricity; pollutant; renewable energy; sustainable development; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136083334

Using new data on AI job postings across 343 US cities, combined with data on subjective well-being and economic activity, we uncover the central role that service-based cities play to translate the benefits of AI job growth to subjective well-being. We find that cities with higher growth in AI job postings witnessed higher economic growth. The relationship between AI job growth and economic growth is driven by cities that had a higher concentration of modern (or professional) services. AI job growth also leads to an increase in the state of well-being. The transmission channel of AI job growth to increased subjective well-being is explained by the positive relationship between AI jobs and economic growth. These results are consistent with models of structural transformation where technological change leads to improvements in well-being through improvements in economic activity. Our results suggest that AI-driven economic growth, while still in the early days, could also raise overall well-being and social welfare, especially when the pre-existing industrial structure had a higher concentration of modern (or professional) services. © The Author(s) 2022.","Artificial intelligence; digital technologies; gross domestic product; productivity; subjective well-being",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136080888

Using CEO turnover events at S&P1500 firms, we find evidence to support the hypothesis that CEOs with a STEM degree are better able to recognize and value the real options embedded in innovation expenditures and capital projects. In technology innovation literature, ambidexterity theory features prominently explaining that innovation often emerges from leadership that is capable of making decisions amidst ambiguity. We argue that real options, a financial mechanism for budgeting amidst ambiguity, are very important with innovation. They require different methods of decision making, and a CEO with a STEM background may be best able to incorporate these decision-making methods into the firm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the individual firms' R&D intensity and acquisitiveness, and industry R&D intensity and gross investment increase the probability of a firm selecting a CEO with a STEM background; whereas being in a technology industry, growth potential, and the firm's own gross investment have no direct impact on the selection of the CEO. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,"Decision making; Ambidexterity theories; Capital projects; Decision-making method; Decisions makings; Innovation capital; Innovation expenditure; Making decision; Methods of decision makings; Real Options; Technology innovation; Budget control; decision making; employment; innovation; research and development; valuation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135891786

Observational data typically do not allow researchers to infer attention choices from observables. We fill this gap in the literature by exploiting a unique dataset of professional forecasters who update their inflation forecasts at days of their choice. In the data we observe how many forecasters update (extensive margin of updating), the magnitude of the update (intensive margin), and the objective of optimization (forecast accuracy). There are also “shifters” in incentives: A contest that increases the benefit of accurate forecasting, and the release of official data that reduces the cost of processing information. These features allow us to link observables to attention and incentive parameters. We structurally estimate a model where the decision to update and the magnitude of the update are endogenous and the latter is the outcome of a rational inattention optimization. The empirical findings provide support for the key implication of rational inattention that information-processing efforts react to changing incentives. Counterfactuals reveal that accuracy is maximized if the contest date coincides with the release of information, aligning higher benefits with lower costs of attention. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Contest; Incentives; Rational inattention; Structural estimation; Survey design","Cost benefit analysis; Cost benefits; Counterfactuals; Economic modeling; Empirical findings; Forecast accuracy; Observational data; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090484987

The increasing number of cyber-breaches targeting businesses makes this activity inescapable. Recently, researchers have published comprehensive lists of recommended cyber measures, specifically to inform organisational boards. However, the young cybersecurity industry has still to confirm and refine these guidelines. As a starting point, it would be helpful for organisational leaders to know what other organisations are doing in terms of using these guidelines. In an ideal world, bespoke surveys would be developed to gauge adherence to guidelines, but this is not always feasible. What we often do have is data from existing cybersecurity surveys. The authors argue that such data could be repurposed to quantify adherence to existing information security guidelines, and this paper aims to propose, and test, an original methodology to do so. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a quantification mechanism to measure the degree of adherence to a set of published information security governance recommendations and guidelines targeted at organisational leaders. The authors test their quantification mechanism using a data set collected in a survey of 156 Italian companies on information security and privacy. Findings: The evaluation of the proposed mechanism appears to align with findings in the literature, indicating the validity of the present approach. An analysis of how different industries rank in terms of their adherence to the selected set of recommendations and guidelines confirms the usability of our repurposed data set to measure adherence. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, a quantification mechanism as the one proposed in this study has never been proposed, and tested, in the literature. It suggests a way to repurpose survey data to determine the extent to which companies are implementing measures recommended by published cybersecurity guidelines. This way, the proposed mechanism responds to increasing calls for the adoption of research practices that minimise waste of resources and enhance research sustainability. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adherence quantification mechanism; Boards of Directors; Cybersecurity; Information security governance; Information security guidelines; Organisational leaders; Survey","Cybersecurity; Statistical tests; Adherence quantification mechanism; Boards of directors; Cyber security; Data set; Governance systems; Ideal worlds; Information security governance; Information security guideline; Organisational; Organizational leader; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124872989

In this context, to predict the optimal remediation options for future decision-making processes in sustainable site management, thus enhancing information communication between stakeholders, 17 decision sensitivity parameters are analyzed in this study and their influence on the management patterns of contaminated sites identified with three decision tree (DT) algorithms including C4.5 (successor of Iterative Dichotomiser 3/ID 3), CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection), and CART (Classification and Regression Trees), which is the first attempt to use artificial intelligence technology to predict strategy-based decision-making for contaminated site management. Based on four performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall ratio and F1 score), CART-based DT model shows the highest prediction accuracy at an average value of 78.57%, which indicates a relatively credible decision simulation to assist in more efficient contaminated site management. With regard to specific factors and influence mechanisms on contaminated site management, the results demonstrate 7 recognition rules corresponding to 6 driving factors which have the greatest influence on the decision-making process. Long-term monitoring time, the type of land reuse and ex-situ performance are the most important factors in determining field implementation of cleanup activities.

The spatio-temporal distribution of shared bikes is imbalanced; therefore, it is necessary to predict the number of bikes that are available at each station to facilitate operations. Many researchers have developed deep neural network methods to improve predictive performance. Predicting bike demand from a higher level by clustering mobility trends has been shown to increase prediction accuracy. However, complex iterative optimization problems need to be solved to stabilize the trend iteration, and such solutions are missing in previous works. In this paper, we propose a novel hyper-clustering approach that enhances a spatio-temporal deep neural network for traffic prediction in bike-sharing systems. In particular, our hyper-clustering approach captures mobility trends among individuals and clusters. Experimental results show that the designed hyper-clustering-enhanced spatio-temporal deep neural network model can predict the number of available bikes more accurately.

Therefore this paper investigates the role of digital innovators and the public's response to digital innovations on the African continent. The study draws from four focus groups, and cross-sectional surveys of 33 digital innovators and 1475 community members across 20 low-middle income communities in five African countries. The results indicate that, while digital innovators are strongly optimistic and highly motivated, their engagement and impact on the circular plastic economy ecosystem are limited by a range of institutional, infrastructural and socio-cultural factors. Furthermore, results from the regression models of cross-sectional data of community members show that understanding of the technologies and perceived ease of use have significant positive impacts on uptake of technological innovations for the circular plastic economy, and perceived ease of use is also a significant moderator of barriers to adoption. The findings underline the need for a well-informed and motivated cohort of digital innovators to promote diffusion of circular plastic innovations. It also emphasizes the importance of a more collaborative, multistakeholder and multi-sectoral synergy to create a critical mass of the consumer public needed to break the linear economy lock-in mechanisms and accelerate the transition to a circular plastic economy in Africa. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Circular plastic economy; Digital innovations; Technology acceptance; Technology lock-in; Technology readiness","Economic and social effects; Locks (fasteners); Regression analysis; Circular economy; Circular plastic economy; Cross-sectional surveys; Digital innovations; Focus groups; Lock-in; Perceived ease-of-use; Technology acceptance; Technology lock-in; Technology readiness; Digital storage; innovation; plastic; public attitude; technology adoption; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136592480

Specifically, it investigates whether Korean firms’ decision to participate in supply chain cooperation policy is associated with firm performance, in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI), alongside its marketing, production and inventory resource efficiencies. The study contributes to empirical research on social sustainability in supply chains and instrumental stakeholder theory. Within a potential-outcomes framework, an endogenous treatment effects model is adopted to address the endogenous treatment in the decision to participate, and unobservable firm characteristics. The study provides evidence in support of instrumental stakeholder theory. The results confirm that unobserved characteristics of the firm impact the selection decision and firm performance. After correcting for endogeneity, the results show that the effect of participation is positive and statistically significant. But this positive relationship is contingent on the extent to which firms are resource efficient. Inventory resource efficiency is found to have a negative moderation effect on the relationship between policy participation and firm performance. Hence the more efficient a firm is in inventory and associated operational efficiencies, the lesser the benefits realized from policy participation. However, production and marketing resource efficiencies are not found to have significant effect as moderating variables. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Endogenous treatment; Resource efficiency; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable supply chain","Commerce; Efficiency; Marketing; Public policy; Sustainable development; Economic consequences; Endogenous treatment; Firm Performance; Resource efficiencies; Social sustainability; South Korea; Stakeholder theory; Supply chain cooperation; Sustainable supply chains; Voluntary agreement; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134779549

In time, the best-known methods and practices are established and standardized for new product development. However, to enhance performance and outcomes, customization is typically needed and requires additional time and effort, requiring a high learning curve. An approach of operational planning to ascertain projected outcomes for a variety of scenarios is agent-based modeling and simulation. This study focuses on product design, an essential aspect of new products. An agent-based model (ABM) has been developed using a paradigm of the design management organizational function represented by four autonomous agents, their actions, and interactions. The objective is to assess the aggregate emergent behavior of the design management organization. Research questionnaires are used to obtain data consisting of agent characteristics from firms covering services and manufacturing, across multiple industry sectors. An initial network of design-related agents was developed based on the collected data. Simulation of the model provided data consisting on a time series of units sold by the simulated organization. NetLogo-based simulations indicated responsiveness in organizational behavior when customer satisfaction drops, in terms of fitness to specifications. This behavior resulted in reversing negative trends in units sold. The time scale of the simulation, metric levels, and behavior was validated using sales data from a company in the electronics manufacturing industry. This model provides guidance on how to configure new product development teams, modifying designer hiring processes, scheduling product development committees, and plan customer feedback collection. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive systems; computer simulation; emergent phenomena; innovation management; multiagent systems; product design; technology management","Computational methods; Customer satisfaction; Electronics industry; Industrial research; Manufacture; Multi agent systems; Product design; Product development; Sales; Surveys; Agent-based model; Design management; Emergent phenomenon; Innovation management; Management agents; New product development; Performance; Product customization; Product improvement; Technology managements; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133704162

As a primary AI tool, chatbots have seen increasing use by companies to support customer service. An understanding of how chatbots are used is essential for improving customer service. Based on the relevant literature, this study examined the impacts of chatbot-enabled agility (namely, internal and external chatbot agility) on customer service performance and explored the antecedents from the perspective of information technology use (both routine and innovative use). We collected data from 294 U.S. marketing employees from various industries, using a survey for the assessment of our research model. The results showed that both routine and innovative use of chatbots were positively related to internal and external agility. In particular, the innovative use of chatbots plays an important role in creating business agility. Moreover, internal and external agility are positively related to customer service performance. Through a close look at chatbots and their use, our study provides insight into the role of AI in creating business agility. Practically speaking, this study suggests that both the routine and the innovative use of chatbots should be encouraged to create agility and develop business sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agility; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Customer service; Dynamic capabilities; Innovative use; Routine use","Sales; Agility; Artificial intelligence tools; Business leaders; Chatbots; Customer-service; Dynamics capability; Information technology use; Innovative use; Routine use; Service performance; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131788486

This study used a discrete choice model (the panel-data mixed logit model) to evaluate 552 actual consumer choice data from Southwest China collected via an online questionnaire. Our results indicate that (1) 75% of respondents feel that electric vehicles enhance the environment and are eager to embrace them. However, the lack of strong recycling policies may hinder their adoption of electric vehicles. Specifically, the four battery recycling policies significantly impact electric vehicle adoption. (2) Consumers appreciate producer-oriented incentives more than consumer-oriented incentives to a lesser extent, such as mandated battery recycling policies and electric vehicle battery flow tracing policies. (3) Consumers place a larger willingness to pay on charging station density than vehicle attributes. (4) Regarding consumer heterogeneity, the usual young group in higher-rated cities prefers electric vehicles, while customers who own a car are more inclined to buy electric vehicles. Finally, more management insights and policy recommendations are provided based on these findings to help government and producer policymakers.

Traditionally, this process involves numerous clinical trials that may take up to several years, during which strict preventive measures must be in place to control the outbreak and reduce the deaths. Advanced data analytics techniques, however, can be leveraged to guide and speed up this process. In this study, we combine evolutionary search algorithms, deep learning, and advanced model interpretation methods to develop a holistic exploratory-predictive-explanatory machine learning framework that can assist clinical decision-makers in reacting to the challenges of a pandemic in a timely manner. The proposed framework is showcased in studying emergency department (ED) readmissions of COVID-19 patients using ED visits from a real-world electronic health records database. After an exploratory feature selection phase using genetic algorithm, we develop and train a deep artificial neural network to predict early (i.e., 7-day) readmissions (AUC = 0.883). Lastly, a SHAP model is formulated to estimate additive Shapley values (i.e., importance scores) of the features and to interpret the magnitude and direction of their effects.

Although studies have investigated this relationship, we still know little about the underlying theoretical mechanisms driving these findings. Using a unique Zambian Business Survey of 1971 entrepreneurs administered by the World Bank, we find an entrepreneur’s social capital facilitates small business productivity through the mediating channels of firm financing (i.e., credit from suppliers, credit to customers, loans from friends and family) and customer relationships (i.e., more customers). Our findings, thus, identify specific mechanisms that channel social capital toward an informal business’ productivity, which prior studies have overlooked. Plain English Summary: Small informal businesses are more productive when they build relationships with customers, extend credit to customers, and receive credit from suppliers and friends and family. Using a unique survey of 1,971 Zambian entrepreneurs administered by the World Bank, we observe that belonging to a business or social association enables these businesses to extend credit, receive credit, and build relationships. Our findings provide more specific mechanisms that channel social capital toward an informal business’ productivity, which prior studies have overlooked. Thus, our main policy recommendation is that entrepreneurs, especially from informal businesses and developing contexts, should focus on networking to foster customer and professional relationships and enhance access to capital, which can help foster firm productivity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","D24; D71; Entrepreneurship; Financing; G21; L26; M13; Productivity; Small business; Social capital",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117056955

It uses a passenger survey of GO rail transit of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area to investigate the factors that may affect the potential mode switching of the current GO rail users. It used a hybrid generalized extreme value with an endogenous latent variables model for jointly modelling the GO rail station access mode choice and the choice of switching from GO rail to alternative modes. The empirical results reveal that the influence of station access difficulty does not become an issue for relatively shorter access distance (e.g. station access distance is less than 5% of the total origin–destination distance). The traveller would rather switch access mode than switching away from GO rail for such a case. Competition of alternative modes, captured through the composite cost of using an alternative to GO rail, is also found to be critical in potential switching from GO rail. It is also clear that drive-alone is the most attractive alternative to switch to. Overall, the empirical investigations reveal that land-use policies that encourage higher residential density around a GO rail station would make a higher number of modes (including non-motorized modes) feasible as access to GO rail mode and thereby reduce the impact of access cost on mode switching behaviour from GO rail. Similarly, developing a high occupancy vehicle lane network and high occupancy tolled road network to serve along the corridors that are served by GO rail would encourage multimodality and help to tackle GO rail’s capacity constraints and their corresponding negative effect of in-train crowding. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Choice-based sample; Commuter rail; Commuting mode; Generalized extreme value model; Latent satisfaction; Mode-switching behaviour; Second-best choice","Land use; Motor transportation; Railroad stations; Surveys; Switching; Capacity constraints; Empirical investigation; Generalized extreme value; Land use policy; Latent variable; Non-motorized modes; Residential density; Transit passenger; High occupancy vehicle lanes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108811937

In recent decades, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries have been working together to improve road safety, considering it an important constituent and reflection of their economic development. However, no uniform road safety measurement framework is currently available across the APEC. To this end, the current study develops a practical and efficient methodology, namely, the entropy weight method (EWM) – grey relational analysis (GRA) – singular value decomposition (SVD) (EWM-GRA-SVD), providing government officials and policymakers with a replicable framework for reporting the road safety achievement of countries. The EWM is employed to obtain the weights of the set of indicators, as the weighting inputs of GRA, to form a composite score for ranking, where the SVD is embedded in the GRA for grouping by means of extracting singular values. Using the proposed model, best-performing and underperforming countries are distinguished, whereby each country could learn from others within their assigned group based on an overview of achievements and progress in road safety over the past decade.

Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the regional adoption of CE, by systematically reviewing and synthesises the current academic literature in this emerging field, unveiling research gaps and discussing a future research agenda. The review was conducted by identifying relevant academic papers from leading journals using the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Overall, 82 relevant papers were identified through the review, which proceeded to descriptive, bibliometric and content analysis. This study has found that generally, the adoption of the circular economy on the regional level is underexplored, which was supported by the dearth of relevant academic contributions detected at the beginning of the process. To the best of the researchers' knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide a holistic systematic literature review in the regional circular economy domain. Hence, the present study is considered as a crucial initial contribution in the direction of establishing robust conceptual frameworks which involve the constructs of regional circular economy and laying the groundwork for future studies in this field. © 2022 The Author(s)","Circular economy; Institutional pressures; Regional development; Regional policy; Smart specialisation; Systematic literature review","Economics; Academic literature; Circular economy; Development policies; Institutional pressures; Regional development; Regional policies; Research agenda; Smart specialization; Specialisation; Systematic literature review; Regional planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135308378

However, scant research has been conducted on energy-saving literacy amongst Ghanaian households. To substantiate the problem, this paper aims to examine energy conservation literacy and behaviours among Ghanaian households in the Greater Accra Region. Design/methodology/approach: The study assessed household electricity use and explored determinants of household energy conservation behaviours. Data was collected through a survey administered to households within the target region and analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearmen’s rank correlation. Findings: Results showed electricity conservation among households is greatly influenced by the number of household occupants, household income levels, and the quality and quantity of appliances. The study also found that conservation behaviours are positively correlated to the number of occupants, household income levels, the quantity of electrical appliances, age of household members, number of rooms and level of urbanization within the home’s geographical region. Cumulatively, the findings suggest households held positive attitudes towards efficient energy practices. Enigmatically, the use of energy-conserving alternative technologies was not widely used by households; hence, this factor does not significantly affect household energy conservation. Research limitations/implications: Although limited to Ghana’s capital region, the findings can be used to inform policy and regulations at the regional and national levels in designing an efficient and effective mechanism to reduce the country’s overall energy use. Practical implications: Premised upon the findings, the study recommends an intensification of education and awareness-creation on various energy-saving regulations and initiatives and thorough education on the usage of standardized (approved) refrigerators to promote the consistent adoption of energy conservation measures among households. Originality/value: This study pioneers investigations into the influence of household demographic variables on overall electricity conservation behaviours exhibited by Ghanaian households. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behaviours; Conservation; Correlation analysis; Descriptive statistics; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Ghana; Households; Industry 4.0; Literacy","Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Industry 4.0; Behavior; Correlation analysis; Descriptive statistics; Electricity conservation; Ghana; Household; Household energy; Household income; Income levels; Literacy; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125071192

This study integrated design and operational data into a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to study the profitability of a commercial-scale tilapia-lettuce aquaponics system in the U.S. Midwest. An operational pilot-scale plant was used to obtain the necessary data for the TEA modeling. A mid-size commercial system with a 5300 L fish tank and a 62–63 m2 plant grow bed space was considered for the analysis. The initial investment cost of the system was $69,230–69,600, with the greenhouse constituting 42% of the cost. The annual operating expense was $33,100 - $33,300, with labor being the major contributor (52%). Sensitivity analysis was performed on land, equipment, feed, utility costs and revenues from fish and lettuce, which identified the labor and greenhouse costs as prime factors controlling the profitability. The market value of the lettuce and its grow space used contributed to the profitability of the studied RAS from the revenue side. A cash flow analysis showed that the system can be profitable, offering a positive net present value (NPV) of $9000 - $12,220. Automated water quality monitoring further reduced labor costs, increasing NPV to $52,220 – $55,545. The TEA, augmented with process data and an uncertainty-based financial performance evaluation identifying key plant parameters, may serve as a framework for evaluating the economic viability of similar food production systems in different locations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cash flow analysis; Lettuce; Monte Carlo simulations; Recirculating aquaponics system; Tilapia; Uncertainty analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Fish; Greenhouses; Intelligent systems; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Wages; Water quality; Aquaponic system; Cash flow analysis; Health disparities; Health foods; Healthy foods; Monte Carlo's simulation; Recirculating aquaponic system; Techno-Economic analysis; The net present value (NPV); Tilapia; Lettuce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132946098

These high FDRs stem mostly from the high fraction of true null effects, about 70%, rather than from low power. Using our estimates, we also assess the potential of various A/B test designs to reduce the FDR. The two main implications are that decision makers should expect one in five interventions achieving significance at 5% confidence to be ineffective when deployed in the field and that analysts should consider using two-stage designs with multiple variations rather than basic A/B tests. © 2021 INFORMS.","A/B testing; decision analysis; design of experiments; false discovery rate; inference; statistics","Decision making; Design of experiments; Statistical tests; A/B testing; Decision makers; False discovery rate; Inference; Low Power; Test designs; Testing platforms; Two stage designs; Decision theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139074264

This study focuses on available technological knowledge in a firm's global supplier network and examines factors that accrue innovation benefits from such knowledge for a buyer firm. Using absorptive capacity as a theoretical lens, we specifically examine technological distance, technological breadth, and extent of global sourcing, and how these factors interrelate in influencing a firm's innovation performance. The panel data is drawn from various sources (Bloomberg SPLC, PATSTAT Global, and Compustat). Our sample spans four years from 2011 through 2014 and comprises an unbalanced panel of 878 firm-year observations derived from buyer–supplier relationship data of 246 unique buyer firms. Embedded in this data are 846 unique supplier firms and 9291 dyads (buyer–supplier pairs). The findings confirm the negative association between technological distance and innovation performance, and the positive association between technological breadth and innovation performance. Contrary to expectations, technological distance plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between technological breadth and innovation performance. The results also show that while the extent of a firm's global sourcing has a positive relationship with its innovation performance, the relationship changes with technological distance. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","buyer–supplier relationships; innovation; patents; technology management","Patents and inventions; Supply chain management; Buyer-supplier relationships; Critical challenges; Global sourcing; Innovation; Innovation performance; Patent; Supplier networks; Technological distance; Technological knowledge; Technology managements; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138491507

While incentives are often successful, there are also notable and surprising examples of their ineffectiveness. Why? We propose a contributing factor may be that they are not sufficiently conspicuous. In a large-scale field experiment (Experiment 1) and three online experiments (Experiments 2–4), we show that even when incentives are transparently provided, failing to make them conspicuous vastly undermines their ability to shift behavior. Online experiments indicate that conspicuous incentives work by increasing people's extrinsic motivation to earn an incentive (Experiment 2) and do not merely serve as reminders to act (Experiment 3). We also assess whether people intuit that incentive conspicuousness matters (Experiment 4); nearly half of participants reject a costless opportunity to make their own incentives conspicuous, which leads them to earn less than they otherwise would. Yet, our results also hint at some degree of sophistication: those who benefit most from making incentives conspicuous are particularly likely to choose to make their incentives conspicuous. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Field experiment; Inattentiveness; Incentives; Management; Salience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137846605

Various groups of passengers perceive service quality differently based on their demographic and trip characteristics. In addition to a naïve market segmentation which is based on pre-defined groups, this study proposes a cluster analysis to identify groups with combined characteristics. This paper utilizes a customer satisfaction survey (CSS) to better understand the impact of several attributes on satisfaction perceived by different groups of passengers. 1028 valid survey responses are utilized from a case study that is a mass transit rail in Tehran, a less focused context in the literature. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to identify the most effective attributes in each group. The results indicate that different groups do perceive certain aspects of the service quality differently which underscores the necessity of undertaking a market segmentation analysis by clustering. Despite differences among groups/clusters, passengers will be more satisfied with a secure and convenient transit system. The findings from this study can be used to develop strategies for specific customer groups and evaluate factors that influence customer satisfaction of such groups. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Customer satisfaction; Market segmentation; Public transit; Service quality; Structural equation model (SEM)","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Mass transportation; Quality control; Quality of service; Sales; Surveys; Customer perspectives; Customer-oriented services; Customers' satisfaction; Market segmentation; Modeling approach; Perceived service qualities; Public transit; Service Quality; Structural equation model; Structural equation models; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136173993

Using the Food and Drug Administration public health advisories as idiosyncratic negative shocks to approved drugs, we examine how drug makers react through investment decisions. Following these shocks, affected firms increase research and development (R&D) expenditures, driven by a higher likelihood of acquiring external innovations rather than developing novel projects internally. Such acquisition activities are concentrated in firms with weak research pipelines. We also find that competing developers move resources away from the affected therapeutic areas.

With customers constantly tracking the status of their orders, the effects of logistics processes on customers' evaluation of their online shopping experience are relatively unknown as academic literature provides little guidance. Drawing upon the expectation-disconfirmation theory and attribution theory, and using a unique dataset assembled in collaboration with an e-commerce firm, we empirically investigate the effects of order processing and delivery times on online customer ratings. We also estimate the impact of positive deviation (i.e., early delivery) and negative deviation (i.e., late delivery) from the promised delivery date on online customer ratings and whether the impact of delivery status (early or late) depends on order cost and freight cost. Our empirical findings demonstrate that longer order processing and delivery times are associated with lower ratings. Our results also highlight that the late delivery of an order is negatively associated with ratings and that the order cost amplifies this effect. Furthermore, freight cost reduces both the negative effect of late delivery and the positive effect of early delivery on online ratings. Our results also indicate that there exist curvilinear relationships between online ratings and the number of days an online order is late or early. Specifically, the negative effect of a late delivery follows a convex-shape curve such that its impact decreases as the number of days an online order is late increases. Likewise, the positive effect of an early delivery increases at a decreasing rate as the number of days an online order is early increases. Our supplementary analyses further account for potential endogeneity issues and corroborate our main results with additional empirical evidence obtained through alternative model specifications and estimation strategies. We present important theoretical implications and managerial takeaways from our findings. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","e-commerce firms; logistics tracking; online customer ratings; order processing times; shipment delays","Cost benefit analysis; Electronic commerce; Ships; Delivery time; E- commerces; E-commerce firm; Logistic tracking; Logistics process; Online customer rating; Online customers; Online orders; Order processing time; Shipment delay; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134801544

Absent innovation, the incumbent sells a superior product compared to the rivals’ ones. Yet, the gatekeeper of the open ecosystem can fill up this gap by engaging in product innovation. We investigate the impact of vertical integration on the gatekeeper's incentives to foreclose its non-integrated downstream unit and innovate its ecosystem to compete head-to-head with the incumbent. The vertically integrated gatekeeper raises the costs of the unintegrated competitor to relax intra-ecosystem competition but does not fully foreclose it as that would cause fiercer inter-ecosystem competition.

This study seeks to develop an integrated model of the critical role of trust and privacy concerns in influencing consumers purchase behaviour through social media. It also explored the moderating role of COVID-19 on these relationships. Quantitative data were collected using survey strategy through questionnaires to address different levels of the study. Our proposed model was tested with 1,200 consumers, 600 prior to COVID-19 and 600 during COVID-19. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling was conducted to assess the hypotheses. The findings revealed that purchase intention depends on trust and privacy concerns. Information quality, security concerns, ease of use, privacy/security assurance seal, and disposition to third party certification are the main drivers of trust and privacy concerns. Furthermore, our proposed model during COVID-19 period has higher explanator power (R2 = 0.741) than before COVID-19 period (R2 = 0.603 and consumers buying behaviour has been increased during COVID-19. The results offer important implications for retailers and are likely to stimulate further research in the area of purchase behaviour through social media. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19; Privacy concerns; Purchase intention; Social media; Trust","COVID-19; electronic commerce; integrated approach; least squares method; numerical model; quantitative analysis; retailing; social media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133162355

However, a vehicle-infrastructure cooperative approach, in which infrastructure and vehicles cooperate to perform the different driving tasks, may prevail in enabling automated driving. This paper conducts an economic analysis of vehicle infrastructure cooperation for automated driving. In doing so, we present a model that captures investment decisions in vehicle automation and infrastructure digitalization and their effect on travelers’ purchase and travel decisions. Our analysis shows that, under certain conditions, equipping both infrastructure and vehicles is socially optimal. However, by analyzing strategic interactions between infrastructure support service providers and automakers, we show that lack of coordination between these two actors results in suboptimal investment in vehicle automation and infrastructure digitalization. Especially, when these two technologies are complementary, service providers are reluctant to invest in digital infrastructure and vehicle manufacturers tend to over equip their vehicles so as to avoid relying on infrastructure technology. Thus, we conclude by showing that better coordination between automakers and service providers – under the form of profit sharing – is welfare-improving and could potentially yield the socially optimal levels of automation and digitalization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Automated vehicles; Digitalization; Driving automation; Infrastructure; Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation","Economic analysis; Investments; Profitability; Wages; 'current; Automated driving; Automated vehicles; Digitalization; Driving automation; Economics analysis; In-vehicle automation; Infrastructure; Service provider; Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation; Automation; automation; decision making; economic analysis; investment; service provision; strategic approach; transport vehicle; transportation infrastructure; transportation technology; welfare impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132876320

To mitigate such impacts, attention in the operations management literature has focused on how firms build resilience in their supply chains, in order to quickly respond to such events and also to return, as soon as possible, to a business-as-usual state. Prior studies have examined the process of building a supply chain (SC) in different countries, industries and in response to various disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst, at the same time, calling for further research in different contexts. We respond to these calls by exploring SC resilience ability in the South African mining industry under extreme weather events. We situated our study in the dynamic capability view (DCV) view of the firm. We examined the direct effect of big data and predictive analytics (BDPA) capabilities on SC visibility and the final effects on community and resource resilience. We adopted a sequential mixed methods research design, collecting data from interviews with 10 industry practitioners and from 219 respondents to an online survey. We built and tested our theoretical model using partial least squares structured equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Notable theoretical contributions of our study are that big data enables a more efficient supply chain monitoring system, which, in turn, improves SC visibility. BDPA capability improves a company's ability to make the best use of its available resources. It improves the South African mining industry's dynamic capability, allowing them to adjust their strategies in response to diverse adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, BDPA capability's ability to improve SC visibility is enhanced when there is strong alignment between BDPA strategy and initiatives. Finally, having a high level of SC visibility helps develop community and resource resilience, which are necessary to ensure that firms in the industry fulfil their responsibilities in relation to social sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Big data and predictive analytics; Extreme weather events; Mining operations; Resilience; South Africa; Supply chain visibility","Big data; Least squares approximations; Supply chains; Surveys; Visibility; Big data and predictive analytic; Business-as-usual; Dynamics capability; Extreme weather events; Mining operations; Operation management; Resilience; South Africa; Supply chain network; Supply chain visibility; Predictive analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132511076

In particular, the solar photovoltaic energy supply chain is used as a case study, encompassing the entire energy production process, from supply to disposal. An exhaustive literature review is conducted to identify the main criteria affecting social, economic and environmental sustainability in the photovoltaic energy supply chain, and to explore the potential impact of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. Subsequently, three Fuzzy Inference Systems combining quantitative and qualitative data are built to calculate the supply chain's social, economic and environmental sustainability. Experts' opinions are used to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on the three pillars of sustainability for each supply chain stage. Finally, a novel sustainability index, Sustainability Index 4.0, is formulated to compute the overall sustainability of the photovoltaic energy supply chain in seven countries.

The petroleum operations in these countries are also primarily in the hands of multinational corporations (MNCs). Motivated by their profit maximisation prospects (PMPs), the MNCs face significant corporate social responsibility (CSR) dilemmas with reference to their contribution to the socio-economic growth of these African economies. Even though there are few studies on CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) within the African context, little or no attention has been paid to how and the extent to which MNCs' PMPs, CSR and CFP interact to affect the socio-economic growth of OACs. Drawing from legitimacy, institutional, and agency theories we employ a panel data approach covering 14 years (2003–2017) to understand the drivers of these PMPs, how PMPs affect corporate ethical considerations, and CFP and their implications on OACs' socio-economic growth. We find that PMPs of MNCs within OACs impede their CSR commitment. There is a significant positive relationship between CSR and CFP; efficient CSR practices impact CFP positively, and MNCs' contribution to OACs' socio-economic growth is significantly constrained by weak institutional environments. We conclude that institutional reforms and strategic investment in CSR could foster rapid socio-economic growth and development within OACs.

We then demonstrate boundary conditions for ACAP based on characteristics of external knowledge affecting the ease of learning. Our results show that IT spillovers are not ""free""; the ability to derive the value of IT spillovers through informal channels - such as online communities - critically depends on both prior related IT investments by the recipient firm and the novelty of external knowledge.

Quickly becoming popular for upselling the premium rooms that may otherwise go unsold, standby upgrade—an availability-based, discounted premium room upgrade—is a prominent example. However, customers, in particular loyalty members, may become knowledgeable about standby upgrades through repeated interactions with this technology, and act strategically, that is, initially choose a standard room with the expectation of being offered a premium room discount through standby upgrades. Consequently, while enjoying the benefits of this program, hotels may face the potential cannibalization of premium sales due to such strategic behavior and need to adjust their pricing accordingly. Using a major hotel chain's 16-month booking and standby upgrades data, we empirically investigate the existence and extent of strategic customers in the context of standby upgrades. After showing preliminary evidence of potential strategic behavior, we develop a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the percentage of customers who are strategic. This estimator captures the sequential nature of customer decision-making for standby upgrades (booking decision, clicking the standby upgrades offer, and requesting an upgrade) through a Sequential Logit Model. We find evidence of strategic behavior in three (out of eight) hotels examined. Considering both a weak-form and a strong-form strategic behavior, our estimates suggest that 12%–42% of the loyalty customers act strategically in these three properties. We then propose a new pricing policy to help hoteliers maximize their premium room revenues from direct bookings and standby upgrade requests. This policy recommends a discounted full price, but also a higher standby upgrade price for loyalty customers, which can bring a revenue improvement of up to 19% over a policy ignoring the strategic behavior and 34% over a policy assuming that all customers are strategic—two reasonable benchmarks without an estimate of the fraction of strategic customers. Our research, thus, provides insights for technology managers on the potential customer behavioral challenges that a hotel may face with the adoption of a disruptive digital technology, and how existing policies may need to be adjusted for the technology to be successful. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","digital upgrades; hotel revenue management; loyalty programs; management of technology; strategic behavior","Costs; Decision making; Economics; Maximum likelihood estimation; Sales; Check-in; Customer decisions; Digital upgrades; Hotel revenue management; Loyalty program; Management of technology; Maximum likelihood estimator; Revenue management; Strategic Behavior; Upgrade programmes; Hotels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126925655

In this problem, a retailer makes periodic decisions on the prices and inventory levels of a product that she wishes to sell. The retailer’s objective is to maximize the expected profit over a finite horizon by matching the inventory level with a random demand, which depends on the price in each period. In reality, the demand functions or random noise distributions are usually difficult to know exactly, whereas past demand data are relatively easy to collect. We propose a data-driven approximation algorithm that uses precollected demand data to solve the joint pricing and inventory control problem. We assume that the retailer does not know the noise distributions or the true demand functions; instead, we assume either she has access to demand hypothesis sets and the true demand functions can be represented by nonnegative combinations of candidate functions in the demand hypothesis sets, or the true demand function is generalized linear. We prove the algorithm’s sample complexity bound: the number of data samples needed in each period to guarantee a near-optimal profit is O(T6ϵ−2log T), where T is the number of periods, and ϵ is the absolute difference between the expected profit of the data-driven policy and the expected optimal profit. In a numerical study, we demonstrate the construction of demand hypothesis sets from data and show that the proposed data-driven algorithm solves the dynamic problem effectively and significantly improves the optimality gaps over the baseline algorithms.

We find that some teleworkers earn a wage premium, but it varies by gender, parental status, and teleworking intensity. Fathers who telework earn more than fathers in office-based jobs, regardless of teleworking intensity. Women without children who telework occasionally earn more than their office counterparts. In industries and occupations where telework is more prevalent, mothers who work from home most days of the week pay a wage penalty compared to mothers in office-based jobs. Using time diaries, we find differences in work patterns and hours across worker groups that could drive these teleworker wage differentials. Most teleworkers work less on home days; however, those who earn wage premiums are working longer hours on weekdays, regardless of their work location. When teleworking, mothers experience more interruptions in their workdays than other workers, which could have negative effects on their productivity. We also find that teleworkers spend less time on commuting and grooming activities but more time on leisure activities and with family on work-at-home days than on office days, and female teleworkers spend more time sleeping and on household production activities. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Commuting; D13; J22; J31; Productivity; Remote work; Telework; Time use; Wages; Working from home",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125300991

While, in principle, discrete-time Markov chains—the most commonly used modelling approach—can be adapted to account for decay in effectiveness, this framework inherently lends itself to strong model simplifications. The application of formal and more appropriate modelling approaches has been supported, but limited progress has been made to date. The purpose of this paper is to encourage this shift by offering a practical guide on how to model decay in effectiveness using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)-based approach. Methods: A CTMC approach is demonstrated, with a contextualized tutorial being presented to facilitate learning and uptake. A worked example based on the stylized case study in physical activity promotion is illustrated with accompanying R code. Discussion: The proposed framework presents a relatively small incremental change from the current modelling practice. CTMC represents a technical solution which, in absence of relevant data, allows for formally testing the sensitivity of results to assumptions regarding the long-term sustainability of intervention effects and improving model transparency. Conclusions : The use of CTMC should be considered in evaluations where decay in effectiveness is likely to be a key factor to consider. This would enable more robust model-based evaluations of population-level programmes to promote behaviour change and reduce the uncertainty surrounding the decision to invest in these public health interventions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Decision-making; Effect decay; Mathematical modelling; Public health; Structural uncertainty","article; behavior change; decision making; economist; human; learning; Markov chain; physical activity; public health; uncertainty; cost benefit analysis; uncertainty; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Markov Chains; Public Health; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121391089

The analysis here first considers the characteristics of a good crowd-sourced value then turns to an empirical analysis which applies those characteristics and their implications to assess the quality of the commonly used crowd-sourced values from Transfermarkt. Our empirical results show systematic influences from some obvious factors indicating that the crowd-sourced transfer fees are biased as predictors of the true market determined fees. The findings are useful because they address the question of whether these values can reasonably be used as proxies for unknown salary in academic research. Additionally, because Transfermarkt values are often used in negotiations between clubs and players, it is useful to both parties to know the accuracy and the bias of the crowd-sourced values. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support; FIFA video game; Football; Forecasting; Transfermarkt; Wisdom of crowds","Commerce; Crowdsourcing; Quality control; Sports; Academic research; Crowd sourcing; Decision supports; Empirical analysis; FIFA video game; Market values; Transfermarkt; Video-games; Wisdom of crowds; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119624929

This research aimed to generate the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) information of topsoil from soil class and terrain attributes (elevation, roughness, slope, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), topographic position index (TPI), and flow direction) using multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR) techniques to develop a spatial distribution map of Ks for an agricultural landscape. Sixty-five cores of soil sample (diameter 5 cm and length 10 cm) were collected from the topsoil layer (0–10 cm) from the agricultural field in different locations (Upazilas) of the Sylhet region (3452 km2) in Bangladesh and conducted laboratory tests following Darcy’s constant head method. The topsoil was clay or silt clay, having very low Ks values. The mean of Ks for the agricultural soils is 1.70 × 10–06 cm/s and varied significantly (p &lt; 0.01) among different Upazilas (sub-district). To generate the topsoil layer’s Ks values, the developed MLR model (with R2 = 0.598 and RMSE = 1.12 × 10–06 cm/s) and SVR model (with training Rtrain2=0.64, RMSE = 1.22 × 10–06 cm/s and NSE = 0.58 and testing Rtest2=0.73, RMSE = 8.19 × 10–07 cm/s, NSE = 0.71) were found suitable compared to simple interpolation methods. The SVR model performed better in the modeling process than the MLR based on the goodness of fits parameter. However, the SVR model underestimates the higher Ks values in both training and testing stages. In contrast, the MLR model was found to be more balanced. Finally, the spatial variability map of Ks for the topsoil layer can be generated from soil texture information and terrain attributes for facilitating agro-hydrological model development in a data-limited area. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hydraulic property; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Spatial map; Terrain attribute; Topsoil","digital mapping; hydraulic conductivity; hydraulic property; numerical model; permeability; porosity; soil mechanics; support vector machine; terrain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117766880

Design/methodology/approach: A critical approach is adopted to interrogate the prevailing cisnormative and binary approach adopted by management and gender scholars. Findings: The key finding is the persistence of cisnormativity and normative gender and sex binarism in academic knowledge production and in society more widely, which appear to have hindered how management and gender scholars have routinely failed to conceptualise and foreground the array of diverse genders and sexes. Originality/value: This paper foregrounds the workplace experiences of trans* and intersex people, which have been neglected by management researchers. By positioning intersexuality as an important topic of management research, this paper breaks the silence that has enwrapped intersex issues in gender and management scholarship.

In conventional metafrontier analyzes, either radial or nonradial DEA models are used in two separate DEA efficiency analyzes. The results of a metafrontier analysis may be biased if this approach is adopted in a nonradial DEA model. One possible problem is that the value of the technology gap ratio is greater than one because the technology gaps to be estimated for decision-making units (DMUs) under different technology groups relative to the metatechnology have no connection between group frontiers and metafrontiers. Furthermore, the direction of projection of each DMU onto the metafrontier is totally independent of the direction to the efficiency frontier of the respective group frontier. Our proposed integration of group technology and metatechnology constraints into a union model offers a possible solution to the existing metafrontier problem and provides more robust metafrontier results regardless of whether radial or nonradial DEA models are used. Four numerical examples and one empirical application are demonstrated, and the results appear to support the use of our proposed model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Metafrontier analysis; Metatechnology ratio; Nonradial","Decision making; Efficiency; Data envelopment analysis models; Decision making unit; Directional distance function; Group frontiers; Metafrontier; Metafrontier analyse; Metatechnology ratio; Nonradial; Production units; Technology gap; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124574214

The net-zero pledges announced to date across many countries and private industries are insufficient to achieve carbon neutrality, which requires implementation of far-reaching and significantly scaled-up climate-positive actions. All technology options that pertain to deep decarbonization and carbon removal must be part of the mitigation portfolio. Transformative action plans must be established in which every individual/organization around the globe is an actor of changes in relation to net-zero goals. Such plans must involve governmental policy support but also encourage voluntary efforts to boost innovations, investments, initiatives, and behavioral changes. Recognition of these efforts is made quantifiable with the concepts of carbon handprint and net positivity. This paper presents a carbon handprint perspective on characterizing the environmental benefits of hybrid energy systems (HESs)—a widely applicable solution to cleaner production leveraging the capabilities of a portfolio of low-carbon energy sources—that provide heat and electricity to industrial processes. First, the carbon handprint and net positivity concepts and their calculation approach are introduced. The state of the art of HES-enabled industrial cogeneration is then surveyed, and the greenhouse gas emission intensities of different energy sources that power HESs are compared. Next, drawing on a case study about a US chemical facility's voluntary initiative to explore replacing its fossil fuel–based cogeneration infrastructure with a clean energy–generated HES, several technically viable scenarios are evaluated—especially those with small modular nuclear reactors—to illustrate how the positive-thinking handprint approach helps encourage and inform the search for widespread influence pathways in pursuit of net-positive sustainability. Finally, current knowledge gaps in the case study are identified, and opportunities to scale up the proposed handprint-based analysis are outlined with consideration of an expanded role of HESs in fulfilling climate objectives. It is envisioned that like-minded decision makers in the industry sector and beyond will adopt this perspective and act synergistically to enhance their environmental stewardship through voluntary actions and make greater contributions to the planet's climate future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon handprint; Hybrid energy system; Industrial decarbonization; Net positivity; Nuclear energy; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Decision making; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Investments; Carbon handprint; Carbon neutralities; Case-studies; Climate targets; Decarbonisation; Hybrid energy system; Industrial decarbonization; Net positivity; Private industries; Renewable energies; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131372248

Demand is random and price dependent, and unsatisfied demand is backlogged. With complete demand information, the celebrated (s, S, p) policy is proved to be optimal, where s and S are the reorder point and order-up-to level for ordering strategy, and p, a function of on-hand inventory level, characterizes the pricing strategy. In this paper, we consider incomplete demand information and develop online learning algorithms whose average profit approaches that of the optimal (s, S, p) with a tight Õ(√T) regret rate. A number of salient features differentiate our work from the existing online learning researches in the operations management (OM) literature. First, computing the optimal (s, S, p) policy requires solving a dynamic programming (DP) over multiple periods involving unknown quantities, which is different from the majority of learning problems in OM that only require solving single-period optimization questions. It is hence challenging to establish stability results through DP recursions, which we accomplish by proving uniform convergence of the profit-to-go function. The necessity of analyzing action-dependent state transition over multiple periods resembles the reinforcement learning question, considerably more difficult than existing bandit learning algorithms. Second, the pricing function p is of infinite dimension, and approaching it is much more challenging than approaching a finite number of parameters as seen in existing researches. The demand-price relationship is estimated based on upper confidence bound, but the confidence interval cannot be explicitly calculated due to the complexity of the DP recursion. Finally, because of the multiperiod nature of (s, S, p) policies the actual distribution of the randomness in demand plays an important role in determining the optimal pricing strategy p, which is unknown to the learner a priori. In this paper, the demand randomness is approximated by an empirical distribution constructed using dependent samples, and a novel Wasserstein metric-based argument is employed to prove convergence of the empirical distribution.

Within the body of knowledge, previous studies have paid less attention to predicting the cost overruns to assist contingency cost planning. Particularly, in thermal power plant projects (TPPPs), the enormous risks involved in their delivery undermine the accuracy of cost overrun prediction. To prevent cost overrun in thermal power plant projects, these risks need to be accounted for by employing sophisticated cost overrun prediction techniques. This study aims to develop a hybrid predictive-probabilistic-based model (HPPM) that integrates a genetic programming technique with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The HPPM was proposed based on the data collected from TPPPs in Bangladesh. Also, the sensitivity of the HPPM was examined to identify the critical risks in cost overruns simulation. The simulation outcomes show that 40.48% of a project's initial estimated budget was the most probable to cost overrun, while the maximum cost overrun will not exceed 75% with 90% confidence. Practically, the analysis will sensitize project managers to emphasize thermal plants' budget accuracy not only at the initial project delivery phase but throughout the project life cycle. Theoretically, the HPPM could be employed for cost overrun prediction in other types of power plant projects. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cost overruns; Infrastructure; Machine learning; Monte Carlo simulation (MCS); Thermal power plant","Budget control; Costs; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Machine learning; Project management; Thermoelectric power plants; Cost overrun projects; Cost-overruns; Infrastructure; Monte carlo simulation; Monte Carlo's simulation; Power plant projects; Power programs; Probabilistics; Simulation-based models; Thermal-power plants; Monte Carlo methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131834775

Carbon prices and technological development are essential to deliver such reductions. Changes in preferences, however, are rarely considered, even though other major socioeconomic transitions – such as those from reducing smoking and drink-driving – have succeeded partly because preferences have changed. This article examines the impact of climate policy-induced changes in consumers’ preferences. We show that low-carbon policies could be better designed if it is recognised that preferences can be endogenous to such policies. For instance, carbon taxes must be adjusted, if they crowd-in or -out social preferences, to achieve a given target. Further, when the urban built environment changes mobility preferences, the value of low-carbon infrastructure investments can be underestimated if such effects are ignored. Third, policy-induced changes in preferences for active travel and plant-based diets could increase the net benefits of the transition to zero emissions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pricing; Climate change; Crowding-in; Endogenous preferences; Health co-benefits; Transport infrastructure","Carbon; Costs; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Carbon price; Carbon pricing; Crowding-in; Endogenous preference; Greenhouse gas emissions; Health co-benefits; Policy-induced change; Price development; Technological development; Transport infrastructure; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; endogenous growth; energy policy; greenhouse gas; policy implementation; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131229229

We find that turnover is negatively associated with future financial performance (one-quarter ahead return on assets and sales growth). The negative association between turnover and future performance is stronger for small firms, for young firms, for firms with low labor intensity, when the local labor market is tight, and when the firm is trying to replace departing employees. The negative association disappears when turnover is very low, suggesting that a certain amount of turnover can be beneficial. Consistent with the concern that turnover increases operational uncertainty, we find a positive association between turnover and the uncertainty of future financial performance.

This study presents a theoretical framework linking uncertainty, capital, and innovation to analyse how bed-and-breakfast small and medium-sized enterprises have innovatively responded to unprecedented obstacles during COVID-19 recovery. Three-stage longitudinal interviews were conducted with more than 30 entrepreneurs between April and November 2020 to unpack their ongoing responses to the pandemic. The recovery process was found to be non-linear due to the shifting nature of sources of uncertainty and changes in entrepreneurs' capital. These alterations shaped interviewees’ responses, especially in terms of product and marketing innovations, which ultimately generated new uncertainty. © 2022","Bed and breakfast; Capital; Crisis management; Innovation; Longitudinal study; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Uncertainty","COVID-19; crisis management; entrepreneur; epidemic; innovation; numerical model; tourism management; tourism market; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127347916

However, what mechanisms enable these investments to improve firm performance? The literature suggests two such channels: the production frontier of upgrading the input factors and the technical efficiency of exploiting the input factors in a more efficient way. We study these channels for increasing firms' value added in a stochastic frontier model. Notably, we find that investments in IT and skilled labor improve firms’ value added, but they do so through different channels. Multi-purpose hardware investments mainly improve efficiency in concert with other input factors, while investments in application-oriented software and skilled labor generally work by raising the production frontier itself. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","IT investments; Production frontier; Skilled labor; Stochastic frontier model; Technical efficiency","Application programs; Efficiency; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Firm Performance; Firm value; Information technology investments; Input factors; Multi-purpose; Performance; Production frontier; Skilled labor; Stochastic frontier models; Technical efficiency; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124286751

Design/methodology/approach: Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 330 full-time managerial employees in established businesses. The relationships depicted in the proposed conceptual model were tested through six hypotheses. IBM SPSS Statistics and SEM-AMOS were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results supported proposed relationships in the model, except the one between organizational culture and green practices. The findings indicate that the more employees are aware of companies’ green practices, the more likely they are going to feel positive about the sustainability performance of the organization. Additionally, a strong organizational culture that supports the green movement and quality improvement practices lead to positive sustainability outcomes. Research limitations/implications: A larger sample size in several major industries would allow the development of industry-specific sustainability strategies and best practices. In addition, a study based in a different geographical location in the USA or in a different country is recommended to see if the findings can be generalized across different industries, geographical locations or countries. Practical implications: Sustainability has undoubtedly become a major concern for many companies today. The findings of this study provide important guidelines for practitioners to balance the implementation of green practices, organizational culture, quality improvement practices and sustainability performance dimensions. Profitability and sustainability can be achieved together when companies are willing to continuously pay attention to environmental issues and strategically invest in initiatives that are cost-efficient and eco-friendly. Originality/value: This study is one of the first that explores how organizational culture and quality improvement practices affect directly and indirectly the relationship between green practices and sustainability performance. The results imply that organizational culture and quality improvement practices significantly affect the relationship between green practices and the sustainability performance dimensions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Green practices; Organizational culture; Quality management; Sustainability performance","Environmental protection; Human resource management; Quality management; Surveys; Geographical locations; Green practice; Indirect effects; Modeling approach; Organizational cultures; Organizational qualities; Performance dimensions; Quality improvement; Structural equation models; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123931884

Under these models, the company installs solar panels for a customer, who purchases the electricity generated from the panels. Under leasing, a customer pays a fixed fee, whereas under PPA, a customer pays a per-unit price for the electricity generated. The adoption of solar panels is also promoted by investment and generation subsidies, which are received by customers under sales, but by the solar power company under non-ownership models. In addition, some states currently have restrictions on non-ownership model(s) to protect utility firms' profits. Motivated by this context, we analyze the economic and environmental implications of such subsidies and restrictions. Academic/practical relevance: The share of non-ownership business models of the residential solar installations is approximately 40%, and we contribute to the operations management literature by being the first to endogenize a solar power company's business model decisions to inform policymakers regarding the ongoing discussion on subsidies and restrictions. Methodology: We develop a sequential game between a profit-maximizing solar power company and utility-maximizing residential customers to characterize a solar power company's optimal business model decisions. Results: We find that a higher investment subsidy makes it more attractive for the company to offer sales, whereas a higher generation subsidy makes it more attractive to offer non-ownership models. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that restricting the solar power company from offering leasing can actually lead to higher total adoption and generation of renewable energy. Managerial implications: We show that, although a higher generation subsidy leads to higher total adoption and generation of renewable energy, interestingly, a higher investment subsidy can backfire by leading to lower total adoption and generation. Consequently, a higher investment subsidy can actually lead to a higher profit for the utility firm. Finally, we find that restricting leasing can be detrimental for the utility firm and beneficial for the environment.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Problem definition: Novel life-improving products, such as solar lanterns and energy-efficient cookstoves address essential needs of consumers in the base of the pyramid (BOP). However, their profitable distribution is often difficult because BOP customers are risk-averse, their ability to pay (ATP) is lower than their willingness to pay, and they face uncertainty regarding these products' value. Academic/practical relevance: We examine two practical strategies from distributors in the BOP: (1) improving the product's affordability through a discount and (2) increasing awareness of the product's value. Our results identify BOP-specific operational trade-offs in implementing these strategies. We also propose strategies to manage these trade-offs that can increase consumer surplus in the BOP. Methodology: We introduce a supply chain model for the BOP and analyze the distributor's pricing problem with refunds as well as the distributor's optimal budget allocation between strategies (1) and (2). Results: We find that, in the BOP, the distributor's profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers' ATP is high. Moreover, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns and commits to a maximum retail price. We confirm the robustness of our results through numerical simulations. Managerial implications: Best operations strategy practices in the BOP can differ significantly from developed markets. Furthermore, BOP customers' limited ATP and high risk aversion generate a BOP-specific misalignment between profits and consumer surplus. Operational commitments, such as free returns, reduce this misalignment and can serve as a signal to investors of a social enterprise's focus on consumer surplus.

It offers search features distinct from conventional personal computer (PC)-based e-commerce channels. Its easy accessibility extends the time available for customers to search, although its shopping environment constraints (e.g., small screen size, single-tab browsing) may inflate search costs. Collectively, these competing features cause ambiguity about the mobile channel's true effect on sales concentration-a key criterion in managing retail operations. The focus of this study is to understand the net impact of the mobile channel on driving sales concentration. Academic/practical relevance: Our study extends the empirical literature focusing on online retailers' channel strategies and their implication on operations practice. It examines differences in primary online channels-mobile and PC-on shaping sales concentration across products and the cost of ignoring such a difference on inventory management, a core decision for operations managers. Methodology: We collaborate with a large online apparel retailer to access customer-level transactional data. We identify the mobile channel's effect on sales concentration using a difference-in-differences strategy that leverages a quasi-experiment stemming from the retailer's decision to discontinue its PC sales channel. Results: We find that the mobile channel increases the share of popular products by 6.4% compared with the PC channel. We also identify scenarios where ignoring this significant sales concentration difference will yield suboptimal inventory stocking by 4.2%-12.9%. Managerial implications: Our paper highlights that the mobile and PC channels have different sales concentrations because of different search features. Ignoring this difference affects inventory decisions, such as safety and cycle inventory levels. Therefore, it is imperative for managers to revise their status quo strategies, such as on inventory procurement, assortment planning, and product display, when integrating m-commerce with e-commerce.

These devices appear useful, yet little is known about their broader impact on worker productivity and behavior. Academic/practical relevance: Efficient production ramp-ups are particularly important when product life cycles are short. An ongoing debate among academics and practitioners pertains to how Industry 4.0, and AR devices in particular, can accelerate the ramp-up. The current study provides empirical evidence related to AR in the production ramp-up context, examines the strengths and weaknesses of AR, and tests four hypotheses, leading to a more nuanced view of AR use in the manufacturing ramp-up. Methodology: A framed field experiment in a manufacturing plant provides a test of how quickly workers can perform new tasks with and without AR support and how the use of AR affects their ability to suggest process improvements. Results: When faced with a new task, workers instructed by AR smart glasses use 43.8% less time to complete the task compared with a control group that relies on paper-based instructions. However, workers that use AR glasses consistently use 23% more time than the control group when both groups repeat the task without either AR or paper-based instructions. Task difficulty moderates this relationship; workers assigned to a more difficult task benefit the most from AR instructions. After the devices are removed, workers instructed based on paper improve their productivity faster through learning than those instructed by AR. In addition, the former group suggests better process improvements than the latter one. Managerial implications: Although these results indicate substantially higher productivity resulting from AR devices, they also support the view that, once instructed through AR devices, workers come to rely on this new technology without fully internalizing the task. This failure to internalize their task then leads workers to suggest less useful process improvements.

I empirically evaluate the extent to which the dual-distribution center (dual-DC) distribution channel and the factory-direct distribution channel contribute to fulfilling orders from retail stores compared with the traditional single-distribution center (single-DC) channel. Academic/practical relevance: Many manufacturing companies develop their distribution omnichannel to fulfill retail orders. To make proper decisions on various channels, they need to understand the trade-offs between different order-fulfillment measures and costs in different distribution channels. Methodology: I exploit two switches in distribution channels of a manufacturing company to its retail customers: one from single-DC to dual-DC distribution and the other from single-DC to factory-direct distribution. To account for the trade-offs between order fulfillment and the costs associated with each distribution channel, I develop three equations for fill rate, lead time, and production and distribution costs in a difference-in-difference framework and then estimate the equations using proprietary data of retail orders and delivery records. Results: The results quantify the contributions of distribution channels to order fulfillment. Compared with the single-DC distribution channel, the dual-DC distribution channel raises the fill rate by 0.4% and reduces the lead time by 9.7% without incurring additional costs, whereas the factory-direct distribution channel increases the fill rate by 0.5% and provides a 5.2% cost savings but extends the lead time by 12.5%. I further analyze these contributions to order fulfillment across demand variability and order quantity. Managerial implications: The findings provide manufacturing companies with valuable knowledge of their distribution channel choices and means to find a cost-effective distribution channel to improve order fulfillment for various customers and products.

When using personalized information, the question of how to protect the privacy of such information becomes a critical issue in practice. In this paper, we consider a dynamic pricing problem over T time periods with an unknown demand function of posted price and personalized information. At each time t, the retailer observes an arriving customer's personal information and offers a price. The customer then makes the purchase decision, which will be utilized by the retailer to learn the underlying demand function. There is potentially a serious privacy concern during this process: a third-party agent might infer the personalized information and purchase decisions from price changes in the pricing system. Using the fundamental framework of differential privacy from computer science, we develop a privacy-preserving dynamic pricing policy, which tries to maximize the retailer revenue while avoiding information leakage of individual customer's information and purchasing decisions. To this end, we first introduce a notion of anticipating (ε, δ)-differential privacy that is tailored to the dynamic pricing problem. Our policy achieves both the privacy guarantee and the performance guarantee in terms of regret. Roughly speaking, for d-dimensional personalized information, our algorithm achieves the expected regret at the order of Õ(ε−1√ d3T) when the customers' information is adversarially chosen. For stochastic personalized information, the regret bound can be further improved to Õ(√d2T + ε−2d2).

To improve merchandise circulation in rural areas, the Chinese government embarked on the large-scale “Thousands of Villages” (ToV) program in 2005. One of its key components was the implementation of an information technology (IT) procurement system to facilitate transactions between rural nanostores and the ToV program's certified consumer packaged goods (CPG) suppliers. The nanostores' adoption of the ToV procurement system was encouraged yet voluntary. We study how this system was used initially and how it evolved over time. If effective, this program has the potential to address the growing social disparity between rural and developed areas in China. We first embarked on an exploratory analysis (March 2012) to understand the ToV program from the perspectives of nanostore owners, the ToV's CPG suppliers, and the government. We then collected interview data. In Period 1 (2013–2014), when the technology was still nascent, we found that nanostore owner's trust in the ToV's CPG suppliers, and system value, played key roles for nanostore owners to use the ToV procurement system. In Period 2 (2018–2019), three contextual factors emerged—population demographic shift, improved technology infrastructure, and trust in new [non-ToV] purchasing platforms—each hindering the ToV procurement system's use. We observed strong government support during the early phases of ToV, but that support evolved from subsidizing the ToV platform and offering associated training (Period 1), to also providing credibility to competing non-ToV procurement platforms (Period 2). Collectively, the findings identify idiosyncratic challenges that arise when public policies attempt to address developing region problems by reengineering supply chains via IT. We provide implications for IT research about technology management in rural developing areas and for managers to recognize potential pitfalls of managing IT projects in supply bases unfamiliar with advanced IT. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","developing world; procurement; retail operations; supplier trust; supply chain transformation; technology use","Developing countries; Sales; Supply chain management; Consumer packaged goods; Developing regions; Developing world; Procurement; Retail operations; Supplier trust; Supply chain transformation; Technology managements; Technology use; Transformation managements; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134041456

We argue that a directionally opposite effect, which diffuses from waiting time to her own service time, also exists in co-productive service contexts where a significant fraction of the service time is contributed by the customer. Multiple underlying customer behavioral mechanisms lead us to hypothesize that waiting's impact is dependent on the service stage and magnifies as the service process approaches completion. Our empirical analysis uses a unique operational data set that combines server log information with instant-messaging transcripts collected from a live-chat contact center. We show that pre-service waiting accelerates customer engagement—one dimension of customer instigated service time—only at the beginning of the conversation and then exhibits a slowdown effect as the conversation proceeds. In contrast, in-service waiting consistently slows down customer responses—another dimension of customer instigated service time, the magnitude of which is higher in later episodes of the agent-customer message exchanges. We discuss the practical implications of our findings on operational policies employed in contact centers. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","contact center; instant messaging; live-chat; people operations; service co-production; service time; waiting time","Message passing; Co-production; Contact centers; Customer experience; Instant messaging; Live-chat; People operation; Service co-production; Service time; Time fields; Waiting time; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132714282

The rating data Matrix Factorization based methods have been widely used in item rating predictions in e-commerce recommendation systems. However, “cold start” and “data sparsity” have seriously restricted the accuracy of such methods. In addition to the rating data, as side information, the massive reviews posted by users rich in semantic and emotional information express user preferences and item characteristics, and will certainly improve the accuracy of the rating prediction. Accordingly, this paper combines the deep learning for the review text and the matrix factorization method for rating data to predict the rating of the recommended items accurately. Firstly, based on the Deep Learning methods, self-attention mechanism and bi-directional RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with the core of GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), the deep nonlinear features of users and items are learned from review texts. Then, these features are introduced as a prior mean into the classical rating-based probability matrix factorization model to obtain the latent factor vectors of users and items with the rating of the recommended item accurately predicted. Finally, adopting MSE and MAE as the indicators, the extensive experiments conducted on four real datasets verify that the proposed model TFRMF (Topical Features Regularized Matrix Factorization) performs better than other classical counterparts. The achievements of this work will provide powerful methods and decision supports for accurate and personalized e-commerce recommendation practices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bi-directional GRU network; Deep learning; Precise recommendation; Probability matrix factorization; Ratings and reviews; Self-attention mechanism","Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Bi-directional; Bi-directional gated recurrent unit network; Deep learning; Matrix factorizations; Precise recommendation; Probability matrix factorization; Probability matrixes; Rating and review; Self-attention mechanism; Matrix factorization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132387203

To this end, this paper aims to quantify the state of practice of offsite construction in terms of current trends and future prospects for the overall industry as well as the following main sectors: industrial, building and commercial, and infrastructure. First, a questionnaire was formed, pilot-tested, distributed, and completed by 100 construction practitioners. Second, the questionnaire's internal and external validity and reliability were examined using statistical analysis. Third, the research findings were validated. The results showed that the future offsite construction operations will be different from the current operations by shifting from single-trade fabrication to modularization, shifting from customized offsite construction components to standardized offsite construction components, shifting from permanent offsite construction structures to relocatable or portable offsite construction structures, and shifting the reliance on single-skilled labor to multiskilled labor. In addition, 87% of industry practitioners perceive that the future offsite construction growth rate in the coming decade will be higher than that of the previous decade. This research also showed that offsite construction will become the norm rather than the exception because (1) the current average offsite construction percentage of 33.64% will substantially grow to reach an average of 54.9% in the future, (2) the offsite construction industry will grow 4.33 times, on average, in the coming decade, (3) companies are planning to increase their offsite construction utilization rate by an average of 5.03-fold, and (4) the offsite construction automation percentage will increase by 7% in the future.

Uncertainty emanates from drivers' competing interests, or opportunity costs. Rather than increase remuneration, some platforms have designed the technology to allow customers to tip, but the subsequent effects on driver behavior and last mile performance have not yet been studied. We explore this feature of on-demand delivery technology design—customer tipping—and its implications for crowdsourced delivery performance. Using netnography and secondary data sources, we empirically ground an adaptive, multi-agent hybrid simulation to propose how customer tipping impacts service performance through context-contingent driver behavior. Our results generally indicate that tipping as a technology design feature mitigates uncertainty in the crowdsourced delivery fleet and reduces fulfillment times and unit delivery costs. We also find evidence suggesting that the impact of tipping on driver behavior is geography-contingent, with tipping having unexpectedly detrimental effects in high population density areas relative to low-density areas. We conclude by making a series of theoretical propositions and managerial implications about designing technology to facilitate crowdsourced delivery. © 2022 The Authors.

The study integrates time series of land use and land cover (LULC), statistical modeling, and qualitative analytical framework to provide a comprehensive assessment of livelihood response to iron ore mining induced land change over an 8-year period (2010–2018). Results of the study demonstrated that the establishment of industrial iron ore mines in 2011 resulted in gradual urban land expansion (average of 7.5%) and exponential population growth (600%) in search of employment through 2018. Due to the inability of the iron ore mining companies to absorb the excess influx of labor, residents resorted to alternative livelihood activities of which artisanal gold mining became prominent. Growth in industrial iron ore mining footprint reduced farming livelihood (- 48%) within the mining concession area, generated several lakes and ponds which polluted fertile swamplands outside the mining area with negative implications for farming, the dominant livelihood activity in the study area. Between 2011 and 2018, the iron ore mining industry directly provided jobs for some people and enhanced livelihoods in its ancillary industries. Notwithstanding, the negative livelihood impacts of iron ore mining on agricultural productivity and forest products was far higher than the positive impacts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Iron ore mining; Land change; Livelihood; Sierra Leone; Tonkolili","analytical framework; iron ore; land cover; land use change; livelihood; mining; numerical model; time series analysis; Sierra Leone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130113295

In this research, we have contributed to the CE literature in three ways. Firstly, we have developed a comprehensive decision-making model that makes a trade-off between different recovery alternatives while considering a wide range of significant criteria to determine the most optimal recovery option. Secondly, we propose a two-phase mathematical model combining the Interval 2-Tuple Linguistic (ITL) model and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to overcome issues related to uncertainty and incomplete information in decision-making. Thirdly, it is one of the first studies to investigate and compare the implementation of product recovery in CE for short life cycle (SLC) vs. long life cycle (LLC) electronic returns. We validate the industrial applicability of the proposed model using real-world data collected from the Indian electronics industry.

The low-carbon energy transition in the electricity industry is a case in point. Following market liberalization, the electricity industry in many countries is now characterized by a co-existence of state-owned and private utilities. We bring together the economic literatures on innovation and ownership to derive hypotheses of how ownership could affect renewable energy adoption by utilities. Focusing on data from incumbent utilities in the European Union (EU) during 2005–2016, we test these hypotheses using regression analyses and qualitative analysis of investment rationales for ten utilities. Results suggest that in the EU, state-owned utilities have a higher tendency to invest in renewables. We find evidence that state ownership interacts with the existence of pro-adoption policies and state enforcement capabilities.

However, prior research has focused mainly on determining the sources of work stress, with a paucity of studies related to measures to improve mental health. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the mix of measures within an integrated approach that can be adopted to promote good mental health. Surveys were collected from 62 construction experts based in 4 countries. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, structural equation modeling (SEM), and a post-survey interview. SEM showed that secondary intervention measures such as those focused on healthy coping and individual resilience do not necessarily mitigate mental health stressors; it also signals the importance of including primary intervention measures in a workplace mental health intervention. These findings highlight intervention measures that could be implemented to create a psychologically healthy workplace. These measures can guide policy-making to boost job satisfaction, mental health, safety, and performance. Furthermore, these results provide a compass for building construction organizations to determine which measures are yet to be implemented in their workplaces and need to be explored. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction industry; Health and safety; Interventions; Mental health promotion","Accident prevention; Health; Job satisfaction; Occupational risks; Office buildings; Surveys; Construction personnel; Expert opinion; Health and safety; Health promotion; Integral part; Intervention; Intervention measures; Mental health; Mental health promotion; Structural equation models; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127360704

In this study, we propose a field-aware attentive neural factorization machine (FAFM) model for large-scale data-driven company investment valuation. The proposed FAFM model utilizes the advantage of factorization machine (FM) to efficiently capture nonlinear feature interactions in a sparse dataset. We additionally consider field heterogeneity among features with fuzzy mutual information and develop an attention neural network to learn predictive strengths of pair-wise feature interactions. FAFM contributes to the literature by overcoming the limitation of FM that ignores field heterogeneity by factorizing pair-wise feature interactions with same weight. Further more, FAFM learns the prediction strengths in a stratified manner by using the attention deep learning mechanism, which demonstrates more structured control ability and allows for more leverage in tweaking the interactions in the feature-wise level. Experiments are conducted on a unique real dataset set consisting of 3,500 listed companies in the Chinese market with features from eight fields: demographics, annual reports, stock financial disclosure, land use, intellectual property, tax, bond financing, and certification. Results showed the superiority of FAFM on prediction accuracy and model interpretability over existing baselines.

A key component in its determination is the estimation of the variance of the forecast error over lead time. Given the multitude of demand processes that lack analytical expressions of the variance of forecast error, an approximation is needed. It is common to resort to finding the one-step ahead forecast errors variance and scaling it by the lead time. However, this approximation is flawed for many processes as it overlooks the autocorrelations that arise between forecasts made at different lead times. This research addresses the issue of these correlations first by demonstrating their existence for some fundamental demand processes, and second by showing through an inventory simulation the inadequacy of the approximation. We propose to monitor the empirical variance of the lead time errors, instead of estimating the point forecast error variance and extending it over the lead time interval. The simulation findings indicate that this approach provides superior results to other approximations in terms of cycle-service level. Given its lack of assumptions and computational simplicity, it can be easily implemented in any software, making it appealing to both practitioners and academics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Demand uncertainty; Forecast errors correlations; Forecasting; Lead time demand variance; Safety stock",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125853141

Thus, reliable demand predictions can be imperative in planning voluntary blood donation campaigns and improving blood availability within Ghana hospitals. However, most historical datasets on blood demand in Ghana are predominantly contaminated with missing values and outliers due to improper database management systems. Consequently, time-series prediction can be challenging since data cleaning can affect models’ predictive power. Also, machine learning (ML) models’ predictive power for backcasting past years’ lost data is understudied compared to their forecasting abilities. This study thus aims to compare K-Nearest Neighbour regression (KNN), Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Neural Network Auto-regressive (NNAR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models via a rolling-origin strategy, for forecasting and backcasting a blood demand data with missing values and outliers from a government hospital in Ghana. KNN performed well in forecasting blood demand (12.55% error); whereas, ELM achieved the highest backcasting power (19.36% error).

Using Institutional Entrepreneurship as a theoretical framework, this paper considers three different levels of institutional pressures (coercive, normative, and mimetic) to examine the effect of each pressure and their interactions on the development of CE. Seeking to clarify the debate on the effect of institutional pressures, this paper considers that the main limitation arises from the fact that previous research has analysed the relationship between institutional pressures without considering the interaction between them and the non-linearity of the processes. Deviating from previous papers, our analysis combines regression methods with Machine learning (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks), and employs data from the EU survey on Public Consultation on the Circular Economy. This research finds that while coercive pressures have a compulsory effect on the development of CE, mimetic and normative pressures do not have an effect by themselves, but only in interaction with coercive pressures. Moreover, this paper shows that the application of machine learning tools has an important contribution in solving interaction problems. From the perspective of environmental policy, this means that a comprehensive policy is required, which implies the coexistence or interaction of the three types of pressures. © 2022 The Authors","ANN Model.; Circular economy; Institutional pressures; Machine learning","Economics; Machine learning; Neural networks; Regression analysis; ANN model.; Circular economy; Coercive pressures; Institutional pressures; Machine learning approaches; Mimetic pressures; Mimetics; Public consultation; Regression method; Theoretical framework; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129295410

Declining demand for firms' output has caused significant financial stress for all kinds of firms worldwide. Production that requires environmental measures usually gets constrained when firms, especially small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), have difficulty in accessing credit. Firms thus face the dilemma of whether to continue environmental behaviors or to fulfill financial commitments to suppliers, employees, and so on. As such, an empirical question is whether the economic consequences of COVID-19 vary by firms’ types and their environmental behaviors. Using 4,888 sample firms from 14 EU member states, this study finds evidence that the severity of damage caused by COVID-19 depends on firm size and whether firms invested in pollution abatement techniques. Specifically, eco-friendly firms perform better during the COVID-19 pandemic, and SMEs are less vulnerable than large firms. In particular, eco-friendly SMEs are less affected by the pandemic than conventional SMEs and large firms. These findings are probably related to the efficacy of government relief programs targeted to eco-friendly SMEs and/or the healthy financial status of these firms prior to the pandemic. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19; Environment; Environmental disclosure; EU; Pollution prevention measures; SMEs","Economics; Environmental protection; Finance; COVID-19; Eco-friendly; Environment; Environmental behavior; Environmental disclosure; EU; Pollution prevention; Pollution prevention measure; Prevention measures; Small and medium sized firms; Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129235387

Thus, the IEs will gain a better understanding and vision of their decision-making processes in this era. Design/methodology/approach: To do this, the authors first created a list of barriers to entry for IEs into Iran's rising economy's agrifood industry. Following that, a multi-layer decision-making approach was developed and implemented to accomplish the research objectives. The first stage utilized a hybrid of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) to depict the level-based conceptual model and classification of the IEs’ obstacles to entry into the agrifood sector. Following that, a hybrid decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and analytic network process (ANP) called DANP was utilized to present a causal relationship between the barriers, identify their causes and effects, and also quantify the relevance of each barrier. Findings: After employing the multi-layer decision-making approach, the results demonstrated that fundamental limitations, including infrastructure and technology limitations, are the most critical barriers alongside policy factors encompassing governmental support and access to global or regional economy/market. According to the results, innovation and economic sustainability of the agrifood supply chain also matter. All of these critical barriers are intertwined and should be planned and solved simultaneously. Furthermore, based on DANP results, the sustainability pillars (economy, environment, society), besides the low efficiency of the agrifood sector in Iran, should be investigated further for future policy makings. Originality/value: A hybrid multi-layer decision-making approach has been used for analysing the barriers of investment in the agrifood sector of the emerging economy of Iran for the international entrepreneurs. Moreover, the authors provide implications and insights for IEs and officials for decision-making in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agrifood sector; DANP; Emerging economy; International entrepreneurs investments; ISM-MICMAC; Multi-layer decision-making","article; conceptual model; decision making; investment; Iran; quantitative analysis; vision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117940184

ACOs represent groups of healthcare providers that are responsible for coordinating patient care with the goal of improving health outcomes for their patient population. To develop a better understanding of the role of health information technology (IT) in a value-based care environment, we study (a) whether there are potential trade-offs between ACO efficiency and quality and (b) whether effective use of health IT enables ACOs to balance competing efficiency and quality objectives. We test our models with a nationwide sample of ACO data using a two-stage approach based on data envelopment analysis and econometric estimation. We observe that efficient ACOs do not make trade-offs with respect to healthcare quality, compared with inefficient ACOs. Furthermore, we observe that hospitals that participated in ACOs, and used IT effectively for care coordination with other providers, exhibited a positive association between efficiency and quality. ACOs with higher levels of meaningful use achievement of health IT demonstrate better patient health outcomes because of greater information integration with other care providers. Our findings imply that value-based incentives alone are not sufficient to resolve trade-offs between healthcare quality and efficiency, and healthcare policy needs to incorporate appropriate incentives to foster effective IT use for health information sharing and care coordination between healthcare providers. © 2021 INFORMS","accountable care organization; data envelopment analysis; efficiency; health information technology; meaningful use; quality","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data envelopment analysis; Economic and social effects; Health care; Information use; Quality control; Accountable care organization; Health care providers; Health information technology; Health informations; Health outcomes; Healthcare quality; Meaningful use; Quality; Trade off; Value-based; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134652572

Technical communication scholars have attended to the increasing use of social media personally, pedagogically, and professionally. Our stream of research focuses on YouTube videos for educational purposes within the various research avenues. Literature review: YouTube has become a viable platform for learning. YouTube educational videos have been studied from many different perspectives, yet research on engagement with YouTube educational videos is scarce, despite the importance of engagement in both learning and social media. Following extant research on YouTube educational video features, we probe the effects of visual cueing on social media engagement. Research question: How does visual cueing (anchors and intrinsic visual features) affect social media engagement with YouTube educational videos? Methodology: We sampled 196 YouTube educational videos on 28 physics and astronomy topics, and extracted visual cueing from the videos and social media engagement information from YouTube. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Results: Our analyses show that intrinsic visual features (color contrast and visual complexity) are significantly related to social media engagement (involvement, intimacy, and interaction), while anchors (math equations and models) are not. Conclusion: Our study supports the empirical knowledge on social media engagement with YouTube educational videos and expands on the technical communication research for YouTube educational videos. In addition, this research contributes to the literature on engagement by extending its relevance to the social media learning environment. Finally, our study provides content creators with new video design insights that can be used to enhance social media engagement with YouTube educational videos. © 2022 IEEE.","Educational videos; informal learning; social media; social media engagement; visual cueing; YouTube","Anchors; Computer aided instruction; Contrast media; Economic and social effects; Linear regression; Complexity theory; Educational videos; Image color analysis; Informal learning; Medium; Professional communication; Social media; Social medium engagement; Social networking (online); Video; Visual cueing; YouTube; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128648562

Although agile operations have been adopted across numerous industries, neither the benefits nor the factors explaining when firms choose to become agile are validated and understood. We study these questions using data on the development of mobile apps, which occurs through the dynamic release of new versions into the mobile app marketplace, and the apps’ customer ratings. We develop a structural model estimating the dependence of product versioning on (a) market feedback in the form of customer ratings against (b) project and work-based considerations, such as development timelines, scale economies, and operational constraints. In contrast to when they actually benefit from operational agility, firms become agile when launching riskier products (in terms of uncertainty in initial customer reception) and less agile when they are able to exploit scale economies from coordinating development over a portfolio of apps. Agile operations increase firm payoffs by margins of 20% to 80%, and interestingly, partial agility is often sufficient to capture the bulk of these returns. Finally, turning to a question of marketplace design, we study how the mobile app marketplace should design the display of ratings to incentivize quality (increasing app categories’ average user satisfaction rates by as much as 22%).

This paper aims to identify the causes of failure for different types of garments and discusses solutions through which to increase their durability. Recent literature has highlighted the need for companies in the clothing industry to progress to a circular fashion model and the important role of consumer attitudes and expectations in determining clothing lifetimes. Garment failure due to inadequate technical durability is acknowledged but has not attracted significant attention from academic researchers. This paper reports on a survey which identified different types of garment failure by assessing discarded items at end of life, explains the causes of such failure and reveals potential solutions, drawing upon data from a series of research projects commissioned by WRAP and Defra. The survey revealed that the most common causes of garment failure are pilling and colour fading. Other causes included fabric breakdown, accidental damage, loss of dimensional stability, logo failure, discolouration, and holes in seams. Increased garment durability is achievable by following best practice technical guidance but also requires effective management of product development and manufacturing processes. Implementation of technical solutions requires appropriate testing, improved technical skills and knowledge, collaboration to promote better design practices, and new business models that support garment longevity. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Clothing lifetimes; Garment failure; Performance quality; Sustainable fashion; Textile waste stream","Failure (mechanical); Surveys; Textiles; Circular economy; Clothing industry; Clothing lifetime; Fashion models; Garment failure; Performance quality; Post consumer wastes; Sustainable fashion; Textile waste stream; Waste stream; Durability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127950499

The Internet of Things (IoT) enables new business opportunities for data-driven transformation in organisations. The emergence of the IoT concept has resulted in numerous definitions, with earlier references primarily focussed on the technological aspects. This has hindered the broader diffusion of the term IoT as, arguably, the definitions do not integrate other non-technological elements of IoT and focus more on business and service provisions. To resolve this, our research identifies the most significant building blocks required in designing an IoT system. This is accomplished through a methodological review of 122 definitions and their consolidation into a novel definitional framework. The definitional framework unifies the traditional technology focus of the earlier definitions and integrates additional elements that are likely to increase the adoption of a comprehensive definition to support the development of future business applications. Furthermore, the framework serves as a reference set for scholarly societies and standards organisations who, in the future, can be tasked with formulating a definition of IoT, as has been the case with the NIST definition of Cloud Computing, which was preceded by several academic studies on defining the term. © 2022 The Author(s)","Category; Definition; Framework; Internet of things; IoT; Literature review","Metadata; Building blockes; Business applications; Business opportunities; Category; Data driven; Definition; Framework; Literature reviews; Service provisions; Technological aspects; Internet of things; academic research; information and communication technology; Internet; literature review; numerical model; organizational framework",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127231096

Whether and how it affects the sales of physical media, which was previously the industry's largest revenue source for decades, is still not well understood. We answer this question using a natural experiment that occurred on October 1, 2015, when the content owner Epix switched its streaming partner from Netflix to Hulu. This event created an exogenous shock that significantly reduced the streaming availability of Epix's content because of the difference in the market shares of the two streaming service providers at the time. This occurrence allows us to investigate the causal effect of subscription streaming on physical DVD sales. Our difference-in-differences analysis shows that the decline in the streaming availability of Epix's content caused an increase of 36.07% in its monthly DVD sales during the 15 months after the event. We also find that the cannibalization between these two channels is much stronger for movies with higher level of content stickiness (e.g., more recent titles, and titles with a general audience (G) or parental guidance (PG) rating or belonging to the children/family genre). Our findings provide important implications for content owners on how to balance physical sales with revenues from streaming licenses. © 2022","Difference-in-differences; DVD sales; Motion picture industry; Natural experiment; Subscription streaming","Competition; Sales; Video streaming; Videodisks; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; DVD sale; Entertainment industry; Home entertainment; Natural experiment; Netflix; Physical medium; Subscription streaming; Video-streaming; Motion pictures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126559019

This study uses innovation efficiency as the proxy of digitalization to examine the contribution of the CEO networks to firm-level innovation efficiency in Chinese listed firms. Using 13,516 firm-year observations in Chinese listed high-tech firms between 2007 and 2017, we apply a frontier analysis approach (e.g., DEA and SFA) and measure innovation efficiency based on the scale ratio of innovation output (i.e., patent counts) and input (R&D investment and R&D personnel). First, we find that innovation is more efficient when CEO has more outside directorships. Second, a significant and positive relationship exists between a well-connected CEO and innovation efficiency when the newly appointed CEO has larger networks than the predecessor. Third, the positive relationship between a well-connected CEO and innovation efficiency disappears when the number of outside directorships is above the yearly median level. This empirical study provides evidence for the network effects of a CEO for improving innovation efficiency. The findings emphasize the contingent value of the CEO's external social capital on agility, especially the multiple directorships in a transitional economy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Agile Leadership; CEO networks; CEO Transition; Digitalization; Innovation Efficiency; Social Capital","Economics; Efficiency; Agile leadership; CEO network; CEO transition; Corporate leaders; Digitalization; Frontier analysis; High-tech firms; Innovation efficiency; Network effects; Social capitals; Patents and inventions; digital image; innovation; leadership; social capital; technological change; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126285123

Hospital readmission causes $26 billion preventable expenses to the U.S. health systems annually and often indicates suboptimal patient care. To alleviate those severe financial and health consequences, it is crucial to proactively predict patients' readmission risk. Such prediction is challenging because the evolution of patients' medical history is dynamic and complex. The state-of-the-art studies apply statistical models which use static predictors in a period, failing to consider patients' heterogeneous medical history. Our approach-Trajectory-BAsed DEep Learning (TADEL)-is motivated to tackle the deficiencies of the existing approaches by capturing dynamic medical history. We evaluate TADEL on a five-year national Medicare claims dataset including 3.6 million patients per year over all hospitals in the United States, reaching an F1 score of 87.3% and an AUC of 88.4%. Our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that health status factors and insurance coverage are important predictors for readmission. This study contributes to IS literature and analytical methodology by formulating the trajectory-based readmission prediction problem and developing a novel deep-learning-based readmission risk prediction framework. From a health IT perspective, this research delivers implementable methods to assess patients' readmission risk and take early interventions to avoid potential negative consequences. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","computational design science; deep learning; Hospital readmission; predictive analytics","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Health insurance; Health risks; Hospitals; Patient treatment; Risk assessment; Trajectories; Computational design; Computational design science; Deep learning; Design science; Hospital readmission; Learning approach; Medical history; Specific time; Time interval; Trajectory-based; Predictive analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125422458

With the explosion of information sources on the web and emergence of predictive analytics, many investors moved beyond traditional financial measures, as key predictors of firm performance, to textual content from analysts’ reports. Empirical research suggests that these information sources complement each other by providing a clear picture of firm performance, but remains silent on the role of additional textual content that continues to emerge and reach more potential investors on the web. We build on this line of research to examine the effect of textual content from business journals in conjunction with summary measures on cumulative abnormal returns. We use sentiment analysis with machine learning and econometrics methods to examine content extracted from textual articles about S&P 500 index companies that are published in the Wall Street Journal (years 2013–2016). Textual analysis of business journals in conjunction with quantitative measures revealed direct and interaction effects on abnormal returns over time. We also tested for robustness by replicating the analysis with different variable operationalization and observe consistent patterns. Relative to positive sentiments, negative sentiments have more profound effects on cumulative abnormal returns. The effect of positive sentiments becomes weaker when past quantitative measures are high. As information sources continue to emerge on the web, this work makes key contributions to the practice of sentiment analysis in financial markets. © 2022 The Authors","Abnormal returns; Econometrics; Machine learning; Sentiments","Economics; Investments; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Sentiment analysis; Abnormal returns; Cumulative abnormal returns; Firm Performance; Information sources; Mixed-methods research; News articles; Quantitative measures; Sentiment; Sentiment analysis; Textual content; Statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125387183

A framework is then used to analyze this data in terms of consistent, predictable delays (systematic delays) and random variation on a segment-by-segment basis (stochastic delays). All methods and datasets used are generalizable to transit systems which report vehicle locations in terms of GTFS-RT parameters. This provides a network-wide screening tool that can be used to determine locations where reactive treatments (e.g., schedule padding) or proactive infrastructural changes (e.g., bus-only lanes, transit signal priority) may be effective at improving efficiency and reliability. To demonstrate this framework, a case study is performed regarding one year of GTFS-RT data retrieved from the King County Metro bus network in Seattle, Washington. Stochastic and systematic delays were calculated and assigned to segments in the network, providing insight to spatial trends in reliability and efficiency. Findings for the study network suggest that high-pace segments create an opportunity for large, stochastic speedups, while the network as a whole may carry excessive schedule padding. In addition to the static analysis discussed in this paper, an online interactive visualization tool was developed to display ongoing performance measures in the case study region.

Referred to as IT consumerization, employees use their smartphones, notebooks and tablets in the workplace, accompanied by a growing toolbox of applications. Google Apps and Dropbox are just a few consumer tools that employees use to get their work done, and in doing so, often bypass the authority of the IT department and the organization. While some organizations discourage, or even prohibit, employees from using their personal IT, others embrace the phenomenon. Employees’ investment in consumer IT and its accompanying applications has been suggested as related to innovation and productivity gains, but there has been no empirical validation of such a beneficial relationship. With this paper we propose a theoretical root cause for the perceived positive outcomes of employees using their personal technologies in the workplace. Specifically, we explore the role of IT empowerment—a concept that captures the level of authority an employee assumes in utilizing IT in order to control or improve aspects of their job. Surveying 147 employees, we find support for increased levels of IT empowerment and higher levels of perceived performance among those that actively use consumer IT versus those that do not; we also find a close relationship between IT empowerment and perceived innovative work behaviors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer IT; IT consumerization; IT empowerment; Perceived innovative work behaviors; Perceived productivity","Consumer behavior; Personnel; Consumer IT; Consumerisation; Gaining momentum; IT consumerization; IT empowerment; Organizational transformation; Perceived innovative work behavior; Perceived productivity; Smart phones; Work behavior; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123739147

Firms often employ various signals to secure higher levels of foreign direct investment in R&D. However, the majority of research on this topic focuses on the role of positive rather than negative signals. Firms are often conservative about communicating negative information regarding their innovation projects due to concerns around competition and managerial performance appraisal. Drawing on signaling theory, this study investigates the impact of a negatively valenced signal – the experience of abandoning innovation projects – on attracting foreign direct investment in R&D. Moreover, although firms are known to send multiple signals simultaneously, little is known about how the interactions between oppositely valenced signals (specifically, the experience of abandoning innovation projects, which is a negative signal, and the filing of patent applications, which is a positive signal) affect foreign direct investment in R&D. A study of 11,354 Spanish firms from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel during the period 2008–2015 found that the experience of abandoning innovation projects has a positive effect on foreign direct investment in R&D. However, this positive effect is weakened by patent applications due to the signaling of conflicting messages. These results have important theoretical and practical implications for the advancement of signaling theory and the management of innovation setbacks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Abandoned innovation; Foreign direct investment in R&D; Multiple signals; Negative signals; Patent applications; Signaling theory","Competition; Investments; Patents and inventions; Abandoned innovation; Foreign direct investment in R&D; Foreign direct investments; Innovation programs; Market intelligence; Multiple signal; Negative information; Negative signal; Patent applications; Signaling theory; Signaling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121105443

In our research, we build on early insights and pivot from considering whether TMTs can engage indecision-making that balances these tensions to focus instead on when certain types of TMTs are able to achieve such balance. We employ a novel configurational analytical approach and a theoretical framework built from role theory to examine the CEO-TMT interface in a new way. In so doing, we are able to identify specific CEO-TMT constellations that support decision-making that is both fast and rigorous. Using a unique primary dataset and an abductive, configurational approach grounded in fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we identify six specific leader-team configurations that each facilitate decision processes characterized by rigorous intra-team debate, meaningful reconciliation of divergent ideas, and fast decision speed (which we describe as strategic decision-making balance).

As social media use expands in terms of the number of users and functionality; it is important to understand social media user privacy-protection behaviors and the users’ psychological underpinnings driving those behaviors. Among these, perceptions are the users’ evaluation of their privacy concerns and data sharing benefits inherent in social media use which influence the users’ behaviors to protect their privacy. Design/methodology/approach: To research these issues, a theoretical model and hypotheses were developed, based on self-efficacy theory. The theoretical model was empirically tested using 193 questionnaire responses collected from students enrolled in business courses at a medium-sized university in the western USA. All the respondents reported that they routinely use social media. The empirical analysis was performed using structural equations modeling in PC SAS version 9.4, procedure Calis. Findings: The estimation of the paths in the structural model indicates that privacy concerns positively influence social media users’ protection behaviors while the perceived benefits of data sharing negatively influence protection behaviors. Privacy experience positively influences privacy concerns. Alternatively, social media use positively influences social media self-efficacy and perceived usefulness, which, in turn, have meaningful influences on data sharing benefits. Originality/value: Previous findings about the effect of self-efficacy on protection behaviors has been inconclusive. This study adds some clarity. Specifically, the findings suggest that the effect depends upon the foci of self-efficacy. While higher self-efficacy with respect to using privacy-related features of a specific technology tends to lead to greater privacy concerns, higher self-efficacy with respect to the more general technology (e.g. social media, computer) seems to affect protection behaviors through perceived benefits. Further, the results of this study offer conclusions about the roles that privacy experiences, social media use and perceived social media benefits play in affecting protection behaviors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Computer privacy; Privacy benefits; Privacy concerns; Privacy experience; Privacy protection behaviors; Privacy protection behaviors; Self-efficacy","Behavioral research; Computer privacy; Data privacy; Economic and social effects; User profile; Media use; Privacy benefit; Privacy concerns; Privacy experience; Privacy protection; Privacy protection behavior; Self efficacy; Social media; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119348698

In this regard, this study aims to explore the issue of biomass energy consumption and its related emission effects on the economic and environmental well-being of the economy of Cyprus. Design/methodology/approach: This study sources time series data on specific variables from the Global Material Flow and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI, 2020) between 1990 and 2016. The Robust least square (ROB-L2) in conjunction with Pesaran autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methodology analysis techniques was used in addition to the Granger causality tests to examine the direction of causality flow between the variables under consideration. Findings: The results indicate that biomass energy usage in the long run reduces pollution and negatively correlates with CO2 emissions level. Also, the decline of emission is influenced by increased foreign direct investment (FDI), thus, activities of foreign investors contribute to combating emission in the country. According to empirical results, non-renewable energy consumption showed both positive and negative influences on increased emission level, whereas economic growth is increasing carbon dioxide emission for the case of Cyprus. Originality/value: This study applies current reliable data that offers renewed insights and sheds light on the state of affairs on biomass utilization from a developing country perspective. Additionally, it extends the discourse on the impact of biomass utilization on CO2 emissions by considering the impact of FDI, trade flow and energy consumption in a carbon-income function built on the liner version of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis.

Often these interactions are fraught with controversies over public safety protocols. The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of frontline workers' perceptions of workplace safety and customer misbehaviors on their stress and psychological distress to inform managing workplace health and safety during public health crises. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an online survey of 3,344 supermarket workers in the state of Arizona (US) during the state's first COVID-19 pandemic wave in July 2020. Measures included mental health distress, and perceptions of workplace safety and customer behaviors. The authors utilized a mixed-methods approach combining multiple regression analyses with qualitative analyses of open-ended comments. Findings: Workers reported high rates of stress and psychological distress. Increases in mental health morbidity were correlated with perceptions of being unsafe in the workplace and concerns about negative customer encounters. Qualitative analyses reveal frustration with management's efforts to reduce risks intertwined with feelings of being unsafe and vulnerable to threatening customer encounters. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need to provide and enforce clear safety guidelines, including how to manage potential hostile customer interactions, to promote positive health workplace management during a pandemic.

In response, numerous models have been advanced to predict and explain people’s choices between gambles. Although some of these models have had a great impact in the behavioral, social, and management sciences, there is little consensus about which model offers the best account of choice behavior. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale comparison of 58 prominent models of risky choice, using 19 existing behavioral data sets involving more than 800 participants. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate models in terms of individual-level predictive performance across a range of different choice settings. We also identify the psychological mechanisms that lead to superior predictive performance and the properties of choice stimuli that favor certain types of models over others. Moreover, drawing on research on the wisdom of crowds, we argue that each of the existing models can be seen as an expert that provides unique forecasts in choice predictions. Consistent with this claim, we find that crowds of risky choice models perform better than individual models and thus provide a performance bound for assessing the historical accumulation of knowledge in our field. Our results suggest that each model captures unique aspects of the decision process and that existing risky choice models offer complementary rather than competing accounts of behavior. We discuss the implications of our results on theories of risky decision making and the quantitative modeling of choice behavior.

Academic/practical relevance: As COVID-19 continues to disrupt offline retail, anecdotal evidence suggests a rapid growth of e-commerce. However, the pandemic may also significantly decrease offline logistics capacity, which in turn decreases e-commerce sales. Then, how does e-commerce respond to COVID-19, and what are the corresponding opportunities and challenges? Methodology: We leverage e-commerce sales data from Alibaba and construct a city-day panel across three years, representing sales for all buyers and sellers on the platform across 339 cities in mainland China. We develop three identification strategies to estimate the overall impact of COVID-19 (based on a year-on-year comparison), the impact of COVID-19 intensity (based on the different number of cases across cities), and the impact of corresponding containment measures (leveraging policy changes of checkpoint, partial shutdown, and complete shutdown measures across cities). Results: We provide two key findings. First, across different identification strategies, we observe a common drop and recovery pattern, which illustrates the digital resilience of e-commerce during the pandemic. For example, we estimate an overall decrease of 22% in e-commerce sales during the period of the Wuhan shutdown (January 23–April 7, 2020). However, it recovers in most cities within five weeks. Second, we identify a key operational driver—logistics capacity—that significantly explains the decline and recovery of e-commerce sales during and after the outbreak. Managerial implications: We provide important evidence on how e-commerce responds to and recovers from COVID-19, contrary to the common perception. The evidence in the recovery phase can also inform platforms and policymakers to design digital strategies and invest in logistics infrastructure. © 2022 INFORMS","containment measures; COVID-19; digital resilience; e-commerce; logistics","Electronic commerce; Recovery; Sales; Anecdotal evidences; Buyers and sellers; Containment measure; Digital resilience; E- commerces; E-commerce operations; Identification strategies; Offline; Problem definition; Rapid growth; COVID-19",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132240169

Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD  20742, United States","Problem definition: We explore consumer equilibrium and efficiency in group buying events, in which the unit price for a good or service decreases with higher number of consumer sign-ups. Specifically, we study the following questions: (i) How does the dynamic consumer sign-up equilibrium evolve during these events? (ii) Is there empirical evidence that employing group buying increases demand? If so, by how much? (iii) Are there profit gains from employing this mechanism and how can they be improved? Academic/practical relevance: Group buying events are becoming increasingly popular in certain markets, especially in China. Our study contributes to better understanding of this innovative pricing mechanism and its effects on demand and profits, and can help with more effective implementation in practice. Methodology: We build a continuous-time dynamic game theoretical model to study consumer behavior and solve for its equilibrium. We then apply it to data obtained from group buying events employed by a large retailer and use structural regression methods and data clustering to estimate and evaluate demand and profit effects. Results: We demonstrate that our theoretical equilibrium is a good fit for the observed consumer behavior. We empirically show that group buying discounts are not very effective in boosting demand for very low and very high base demand levels but can significantly improve demand for intermediate levels. We estimate that employing group buying improved the retailer’s product demand and profits by 16.6% and 11.1%, respectively, and with better price and discount selections, it can improve profits by more than 30% on average. Managerial implications: Our theoretical model provides insights into dynamic consumer behavior during group buying events and can be a basis for researchers and practitioners in studying and designing these events. Our findings provide concrete support for managers on benefits of employing the mechanism, and our data-based method and analysis provide guidance for improving performance. © 2022 INFORMS","dynamic equilibrium; empirical analysis; group buying","Clustering algorithms; Consumer behavior; Dynamics; Efficiency; Game theory; Managers; Regression analysis; Sales; Continuous-time dynamics; Dynamic equilibrium; Dynamic game; Empirical analysis; Group buying; On demands; Pricing mechanism; Problem definition; Profit-gains; Unit prices; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132227282

ACOs consist of providers from various stages of the care continuum (preacute, acute, and postacute) that voluntarily assume collective responsibility for the quality and cost of care for a defined patient population. Academic/practical relevance: ACOs’ unsatisfied outcomes are largely due to a lack of provider collaboration. There is a dearth of empirical studies on how to develop collaboration structures. Studies in the healthcare operations management primarily have focused on collaboration within a single organization, shedding little light on this problem. We address this issue by exploring two distinct dimensions of collaboration: partnership scope and scale. Partnership scope measures the presence of providers from the preacute, acute, and/or postacute care-continuum stages, whereas partnership scale measures the presence of providers within a single care-continuum stage. Methodology: We assemble a unique data set of provider types, collaboration structures, and system-level performance for 528 Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACOs from 2013–2016. To investigate the impact of partnership scope and scale on ACO performance, we then use econometric estimation approaches that account for endogeneity in collaboration structure decisions. ACO performance is measured by experiential quality and 30-day readmission rates. As additional tests, we also investigate our research questions by assembling data sets at both the hospital level (20,975 hospital-year panel data spanning 2009 to 2015) and patient level (859,145 Medicare patients admitted to 39 California hospitals over a four-year period from 2012 to 2015). Results: We find that synergies exist between partnership scope and scale with respect to ACO performance. Specifically, an average-sized ACO can realize 3.2% more improvement in experiential quality and a 6.6% greater reduction in 30-day readmission rates through partnership scope and scale synergies in the preacute care stage. We also show that the benefits of increasing partnership scope are consistent across providers and patient-level analysis. Further, we find that these benefits come at some cost, suggesting an initial cost-quality trade-off when developing collaboration structures. Managerial implications: Our results offer important insights into the healthcare operations management literature on designing effective healthcare delivery systems extending beyond a single organization. © 2022 INFORMS","accountable care organizations; collaboration structures; econometric analysis; empirical research; healthcare delivery; healthcare management","Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Health care; Health insurance; Accountable care organization; Collaboration structure; Data set; Delivery systems; Econometric analysis; Empirical research; Health-care managements; Healthcare delivery; Healthcare operations managements; Organization performance; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132214548

In each period, the retailer needs to decide how to “frame” (i.e., display, rank, price) each product on his or her website as well as how to fulfill a new demand. Academic/practical relevance: E-commerce retail is known to suffer from thin profit margins. Using the data from a major U.S. retailer, we show that jointly planning product framing and order fulfillment can have a significant impact on online retailers’ profitability. This is a technically challenging problem as it involves both inventory and cardinality constraints. In this paper, we make progress toward resolving this challenge. Methodology: We use techniques such as randomized algorithms and graph-based algorithms to provide a tractable solution heuristic that we analyze through asymptotic analysis. Results: Our proposed randomized heuristic policy is based on the solution of a deterministic approximation to the stochastic control problem. The key challenge is in constructing a randomization scheme that is easy to implement and that guarantees the resulting policy is asymptotically optimal. We propose a novel two-step randomization scheme based on the idea of matrix decomposition and a rescaling argument. Managerial implications: Our numerical tests show that the proposed policy is very close to optimal, can be applied to large-scale problems in practice, and highlights the value of jointly optimizing product framing and order fulfillment decisions. When inventory across the network is imbalanced, the widespread practice of planning product framing without considering its impact on fulfillment can result in high shipping costs, regardless of the fulfillment policy used. Our proposed policy significantly reduces shipping costs by using product framing to manage demand so that it occurs close to the location of the inventory. © 2021 INFORMS","asymptotic analysis; e-commerce retail; order fulfillment; product framing","Costs; Electronic commerce; Graphic methods; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Profitability; Random processes; Sales; Ships; Stochastic control systems; Cardinality constraints; E- commerces; E-commerce retail; Inventory constraints; Joint products; Multinomial logit model; Order fulfillment; Product framing; Randomisation; Shipping cost; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132212358

While this concept has been thoroughly studied with regard to single-stage systems, there is still a gap when it is extended to two-stage tandem structures, which better correspond to a real-world scenario. In this paper, we argue that in this context, a meaningful ranking of the DMUs is obtained; this outcome simultaneously considers the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints within the self-appraisal context, and the most favourable and unfavourable weight sets of each of the other DMUs in a peer-appraisal setting. We initially extend the optimistic-pessimistic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models to the specifications of such a two-stage structure. The two opposing self-efficiency measures are merged to a combined self-efficiency measure via the geometric average. Under this framework, the DMUs are further evaluated in a peer setting via the interval cross-efficiency (CE). This methodological tool is applied to evaluate the target DMU in relation to the most favourable and unfavourable weight profiles of each of the other DMUs, while maintaining the combined self-efficiency measure. We, thus, determine an interval individual CE score for each DMU and flow. By treating the interval CE matrix as a multi-criteria decision making problem and by utilising several well-established approaches from the literature, we delineate its remaining elements; we show how these lead us to a meaningful ultimate ranking of the DMUs. A numerical example about the efficiency evaluation of ten bank branches in China illustrates the applicability of our modelling approaches. © 2022 EDP Sciences.

Our text mining analysis identifies several terms in ToS that pose significant risks to consumers. We propose a prototype text mining process that scans ToS agreements on behalf of consumers and assigns an overall severity score based on the potential threats. We supplement this with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for topic modeling in our corpus of ToS documents, to identify user-unfriendly clauses from ToS documents. Next, our empirical analysis reveals three novel findings. First, the presence of hostile clauses in ToS negatively impacts customer satisfaction but is associated with higher survival of firms. Second, firms with higher market share prefer less consumer-unfriendly terms in their ToS. Third, the impact of market share on firm performance is partially mediated by ToS severity. Overall, this study analyzes the linkage between market share, ToS severity, and firm performance, and provides significant insights on ToS policies to IS scholars, legal experts, and firms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Business; Customer satisfaction; Firm survival; Mediation analysis; Terms of Service (ToS); Text mining; ToS strictness; User agreements","Customer satisfaction; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Risk assessment; Sales; Semantics; Customers' satisfaction; Firm survival; Market share; Mediation analysis; Service agreements; Term of service; Term of service strictness; Terms of services; User agreements; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129617277

Omnichannel fulfillment problems have two components: (1) accepting a certain number of online orders prior to seeing store demands and (2) satisfying (or filling) some of these accepted online demands as efficiently as possible with any leftover inventory after store demands have been met. Hence, there is a fundamental trade-off between store cancellations of accepted online orders and potentially increased profits because of more acceptances of online orders. We study this joint problem of online order acceptance and fulfillment (including cancellations) to minimize total costs, including shipping charges and cancellation penalties in single-period and limited multiperiod settings. Academic/practical relevance: Despite the growing importance of omnichannel fulfillment via online orders, our work provides the first study incorporating cancellation penalties along with fulfillment costs. Methodology: We build a two-stage stochastic model. In the first stage, the retailer sets a policy specifying which online orders it will accept. The second stage represents the process of fulfilling online orders after the uncertain quantities of in-store purchases are revealed. We analyze threshold policies that accept online orders as long as the inventories are above a global threshold, a local threshold per region, or a hybrid. Results: For a single period, total costs are unimodal as a function of the global threshold and unimodal as a function of a single local threshold holding all other local thresholds at constant values, motivating a gradient search algorithm. Reformulating as an appropriate linear program with network flow structure, we estimate the derivative (using infinitesimal perturbation analysis) of the total cost as a function of the thresholds. We validate the performance of the threshold policies empirically using data from a high-end North American retailer. Our two-location experiments demonstrate that local thresholds perform better than global thresholds in a wide variety of settings. Conversely, in a narrow region with negatively correlated online demand between locations and very low shipping costs, global threshold outperforms local thresholds. A hybrid policy only marginally improves on the better of the two. In multiple periods, we study one- and two-location models and provide insights into effective solution methods for the general case. Managerial implications: Our methods provide effective algorithms to manage fulfillment costs for online orders, demonstrating a significant reduction over policies that treat each location separately and reflecting the significant advantage of incorporating shipping in computing thresholds. Numerical studies provide insights as to why local thresholds perform well in a wide variety of situations. © 2021 INFORMS","dynamic programming; infinitesimal perturbation analysis; omnichannel retail; stochastic programming","Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Linear programming; Location; Sales; Ships; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Acceptance policies; Global threshold; Infinitesimal perturbation analysis; Local thresholds; Omnichannel retail; Online orders; Order acceptance; Single period; Threshold policies; Unimodal; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128988923

The integrated perspective that Agenda 2030 calls for is ever more important for understanding the vulnerability of our eco-socio-economic systems and for designing policies for enhanced resilience. Since the emergence of COVID-19, countries and international institutions have strengthened their monitoring systems to produce timely data on infections, fostering data-driven decision-making often without the support of systemic-based simulation models. Evidence from the initial phases of the pandemic indicates that countries that were able to implement effective policies before the number of cases grew large (e.g. Australia) managed to contain COVID-19 to a much greater extent than others. We argue that prior systemic knowledge of a phenomenon provides the essential information to correctly interpret data, develop a better understanding of the emerging behavioural patterns and potentially develop early qualitative awareness of how to react promptly in the early phases of destructive phenomena, eventually providing the ground for building more effective simulation models capable of better anticipating the effects of policies. This is even more important as, on its path to 2030, humanity will face other challenges of similar dynamic nature. Chief among these is Climate Change. In this paper, we show how a Systems Thinking and System Dynamics modelling approach is useful for developing a better understanding of these and other issues, and how systemic lessons learned from the COVID-19 case can help decision makers anticipate the destructive dynamics of Climate Change by improving perceptions of the potential impacts of reinforcing feedback and delays, ultimately leading to more timely interventions to achieve the SDGs and mitigate Climate Change risks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioural pattern awareness; Climate change; COVID-19; Misperception of feedback and delays; system dynamics; Systems thinking","climate change; COVID-19; decision making; future prospect; perception; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127962734

In this paper, we examine to what extent timely after-sales service—that is, faster resolution of repair tasks—impacts technology adoption. In particular, we empirically assess the impact of service wait times on the adoption of solar home systems by first-time users (i.e., adopters of the technology) in off-grid Uganda. Academic/practical relevance: Our study sheds light on a previously understudied driver of technology adoption—customers’ postpurchase experience related to after-sales service. We also provide evidence on how negative word-of-mouth stemming from long service wait times hampers customer acquisition. Methodology: We address our research question using detailed customer-level sales and service data from a leading assembler and distributor of solar home systems in Uganda. We develop a fixed-effects base specification and two instrumental variables specifications that leverage different sources of exogenous geospatial variation—in service-task locations, weather, and road quality. Results: We find that timely after-sales service experienced by existing customers is a strong driver of adoption by first-time users. A one-week increase in average wait time for service decreases adoption by up to 32.4%. The relationship between wait times and adoptions is heterogeneous and depends on the types of pending service cases. We also find that the number of customers acquired through referrals from an existing customer depends on the referring customer’s service wait time. This provides evidence of a strong word-of-mouth channel of information sharing. Managerial implications: Our findings have direct implications for the customer-acquisition strategies of technology firms and for technology investors in emerging markets. Our results are also relevant for policy makers who aim to harness technology to improve the socioeconomic lives of people living in these regions. Importantly, we provide empirical evidence of a direct link between after-sales service and technology adoption, which is of relevance to managers outside of emerging markets as well. © 2022 INFORMS","after-sales; emerging markets; instrumental variables; technology adoption; word-of-mouth","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Investments; Managers; Sales; Technology transfer; After-sales; After-sales services; Customer acquisition; Emerging markets; First-time user; Instrumental variables; Off-grid solar; Solar home system; Technology adoption; Wait time; Specifications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127671321

These operations are challenging due to low passenger volumes, competing transportation modes, and high operating costs. Nevertheless, the recent convergence of new technologies for electric propulsion and autonomy brings the promise of step-changes in both operating efficiency and sustainability. The next challenge is to define concepts of operations that best use these advanced aircraft. We develop a modeling and optimization environment to address this challenge by first estimating the passenger demand for regional air mobility, and then by concurrently optimizing the fleet assignment and scheduling of these operations. This helps identify the optimum fleet composition and the network of routes that best serve this demand. The contribution of this research is the formulation of the optimization as a half-leg half-itinerary mixed-integer linear program using a hierarchical multi-objective approach that provides insights about trade-offs between profitability and emissions. We demonstrate the ability of this environment to solve large fleet assignment and scheduling problems to near optimality by applying it to the United States Northeast Corridor using a fleet of electric and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. Results highlight that the transition to an electrified fleet allows serving twice the number of communities currently served, while reducing the carbon emissions per passenger by fifty percent.

The models capture the immediate and long-term costs of reconstruction activities under highly uncertain conditions using embedded stochastic components on projected materials, labor, and equipment flows. The model identifies possible hurdles in acquiring likely material and labor and prospective thresholds that might affect the housing recovery process.

Based on the equilibrium model, we formulate and solve the optimal pricing problem, in which the TNC seeks to optimize its profit or social welfare subject to regulatory costs and/or constraints. Three congestion mitigation policies are implemented in this study: (i) a trip-based policy that charges a congestion fee on each solo trip starting or ending in the city center; (ii) a cordon-based policy that charges TNC vehicles entering the city center with zero or one passenger; and (iii) a cruising cap policy that requires the TNC to maintain the fleet utilization ratio in the city center above a threshold. Based on a case study of Chicago, we find TNC operations may have a significant congestion effect. Failing to anticipate this effect in the pricing problem leads to sub-optimal decisions that worsen traffic congestion and hurt the TNC's profitability. Of the three policies, the trip-based policy delivers the best performance. It reduces traffic congestion modestly, keeps the TNC's level of service almost intact, and improves overall social welfare substantially. The cruising cap policy benefits private motorists, thanks to the extra congestion relief it brings about. However, because other stakeholders together suffer a much greater loss, its net impact on social welfare is negative. Paradoxically, the policy could worsen the very traffic conditions in the city center that it is designed to improve. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Congestion mitigation policy; e-hail; Pooling; Spatial equilibrium; Transportation network company","Automobile drivers; Costs; Fleet operations; Precipitation (meteorology); Profitability; City centers; Congestion mitigation; Congestion mitigation policy; E-hail; Mitigation policies; Network company; Pooling; Spatial equilibrium; Transportation network; Transportation network company; Traffic congestion; mitigation; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation planning; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126656600

I obtained data from a recruiting platform where individuals can self-report their computer programming skills and recruiters can message individuals they wish to contact about job opportunities. I augment this data set with measures of each individual’s previous programming experience based on analysis of actual computer source code they wrote and shared within the open-source software community. This novel data set reveals that candidates’ self-reported technical skills are quantitatively important predictors of recruiter interest. Consistent with social psychology and behavioral economics studies, I also find female programmers with previous experience in a programming language are 11.07% less likely than their male counterparts to self-report knowledge of that programming language on their resume. Despite public pronouncements, however, recruiters do not appear more inclined toward recruiting female candidates who self-report knowing programming languages. Indeed, recruiters are predicted to be 6.47% less likely to express interest in a female candidate than a male candidate with comparable observable qualifications even if those qualifications are very strong. Ultimately, a gender gap in the self-reporting of skills on resumes exists; but recruiters do not appear to be adjusting their response to such signals in ways that could increase the representation of women among software engineering recruits.

These consequences have led hospitals to attempt to identify high-risk patients with predictive models, but research has rarely focused on survival analysis techniques, model applications, and performance measures. This study establishes the uses of survival models to support managerial decision-making for readmissions. First, machine learning and statistical survival techniques are applied, ten of which have not been used in previous readmission research. Secondly, applications of survival models in a decision support capacity are proposed, relating to intervention targeting, follow-up care customisation, and demand forecasting. Thirdly, performance measures for the proposed applications are determined and used for empirical model assessment. These performance measures have not been applied in previous readmission research. The empirical assessment is based on adult admissions to the Emergency Department of Gold Coast University Hospital (n = 46,659) and Robina Hospital (n = 23,976) in Queensland, Australia. The relevant aspects of performance were determined to be discrimination and calibration, as measured by time-dependent concordance and D-Calibration respectively. A range of discrimination and calibration combinations can be achieved by different models, with the Recursively Imputed Survival Tree, Cox regression, and hybrid Cox-ANN techniques being most promising. Survival approaches linking techniques, proposed applications, and performance measurement should be given greater consideration in future healthcare research and in institutions aiming to manage readmissions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Hospital readmissions; Machine learning; Performance measurement; Predictive analytics; Survival analysis","Bioinformatics; Calibration; Decision making; Decision support systems; Health care; Hospitals; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Analysis techniques; Decisions makings; Financial costs; Healthcare resources; High-risk patients; Hospital readmission; Performance measure; Performance measurements; Survival analysis; Survival model; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124469799

Then, the joint OLS multiple regression (MR)-ANN model investigates the individual effect of these capabilities and further explores their relative influence and the synergistic interplay on ROS and Tobin's Q. At its core, this study not only proposes an innovative approach to quantifying capabilities, but also examines the complementary aspect of both capabilities. We found that both capabilities positively affect two temporal performance dimensions. In addition, the impact of the operations capabilities was larger for ROS, whereas R&D capabilities had a greater impact on Tobin's Q.

Each firm's information security investment and expected profit in Nash equilibrium (i.e., firms make decisions individually) and social optimum (i.e., firms make decisions jointly) are analyzed through rigorous theoretical analyses and numerical examples. We find that making decisions jointly will make the two firms as a whole obtain more profits than when they make decisions alone, whereas this does not mean that each firm will benefit from the joint decision-making process. Our results show that a firm yields a smaller expected profit in the joint decision game than the individual decision game under some conditions. In addition, the impacts of a higher insurance price and a higher investment efficiency on a firm's information security investment and expected profit are explored. The results indicate that, for a single firm, a higher insurance price does not necessarily result in smaller profit, and a higher investment efficiency does not always lead to larger profit. Then we design a compensation-based contract to coordinate the two firms’ information security investments when they make decisions individually. The contract will make the two firms achieve social optimum and ensure that each firm yields more profits than firms without the contract. Finally, we extend our research by setting the insurance amount as a decision variable to verify the above analyses. © 2021 The Authors.

Yet, the number of repair service providers as well as demand for repair have declined over the last decades, while more products than ever before were sold. Thus, for a successful transition from a linear to a circular economy the demand for repair services must be boosted to promote repair business. A starting point to achieve this goal is to increase knowledge about the end consumers’ intention whether to repair broken products or not. An extensive literature research revealed a comprehensive set of drivers of the repair intention covering aspects related to environmental protection, social acceptance, and economic considerations as well as socio-demographic variables, past behaviour, and perceived repair difficulty. Those factors are not only relevant for a specific product category but for repairs of consumer goods in general. The aim is to evaluate the relevance of those drivers for three different repair intentions: (1) to make use of repair service providers, (2) to self-repair broken items, and (3) to use repair service providers incorporated in a repair network. A quantitative online survey was designed, and distributed in Styria, Austria. By means of a structural equation model the acquired data of 900 respondents was analysed. The results emphasise the trade-off between acting environmentally-friendly and economic aspects like repair cost and time, but also highlight the effect of government intervention – in the form of setting up a network and financial support for repair – on shaping this trade-off. Furthermore, past behaviour is found to strongly drive repair intention.

Perishable foods have only a certain shelf-life and they need to be sold for consumption before a specific date. When a product is priced incorrectly, it is often disposed of directly or redistributed. Redistribution of surplus food also has an economic impact on food prices. Therefore, setting an optimal pricing strategy is crucial to reduce inventory and surplus food in an environment with volatile demands. In this context, big data analytics can help managers forecast customer behaviour and determine pricing strategies throughout the retail industry. This study focuses on food waste at the retailer stage of food supply chain (FSC). We present a dynamic pricing model that uses real-time Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data as a novel contribution to decide pricing at different stages of a sales season for retailers. The food waste problem at the retail stage of a FSC is investigated in a pilot project for bulk apple sales to address the research question. This study proposes a four-stage data-driven optimal dynamic pricing strategy for bulk produce to reduce food waste for retailers in low and middle-income countries. A multi-stage dynamic programming method is used to decide on a pricing strategy for bulk produce, with real-time IoT sensor data being retrieved to analyse and determine the length of freshness scores. The effect of the sale price, replenishment amount, discount rate, and freshness score on profit and food waste are evaluated. All these analyses assist managers in taking the best possible actions and remedies. Appropriate interventions boost sales, increase profits by reducing waste and determining competitive sales price, while improving customer loyalty and satisfaction by striking the right balance between food quality and price. Our results show the huge potential of using hyperspectral imaging sensors in the FSC of a retailer. The model is demonstrated empirically to test its practicability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data analytics; Dynamic pricing; Food supply chain; IoT sensor; Perishable products; Waste management","Costs; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Dynamic programming; Food supply; Hyperspectral imaging; Internet of things; Managers; Profitability; Spectroscopy; Supply chains; Waste management; Data analytics; Data driven; Dynamic pricing; Food supply chain; Food waste; Internet of thing sensor; Low income countries; Optimal dynamic pricing; Perishable product; Pricing strategy; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125225408

However, there has been a growing interest in the use of proactive service when a less urgent customer may become urgent while waiting. On one hand, providing service for customers when they are less urgent could mean that fewer resources are needed to fulfill their service requirement. On the other hand, using limited capacity for customers who may never need the service in the future takes the capacity away from other more urgent customers who need it now. To understand this tension, we propose a multiserver queueing model with two customer classes: moderate and urgent. We allow customers to transition classes while waiting. In this setting, we characterize how moderate and urgent customers should be prioritized for service when proactive service for moderate customers is an option. We identify an index, the modified cμ=θ-index, which plays an important role in determining the optimal scheduling policy. This index lends itself to an intuitive interpretation of how to balance holding costs, service times, abandonments, and transitions between customer classes.

The viability of robo-advisors crucially depends on their ability to offer personalized financial advice. We introduce a novel framework in which a robo-advisor interacts with a client to solve an adaptive mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. The risk-return tradeoff adapts to the client’s risk profile, which depends on idiosyncratic characteristics, market returns, and economic conditions. We show that the optimal investment strategy includes both myopic and intertemporal hedging terms that reflect the dynamic risk profile of the client. We characterize the optimal portfolio personalization via a tradeoff faced by the robo-advisor between receiving information from the client in a timely manner and mitigating behavioral biases in the communicated risk profile. We argue that the optimal portfolio’s Sharpe ratio and return distribution improve if the robo-advisor counters the client’s tendency to reduce market exposure during economic contractions when the market risk-return tradeoff is more favorable.

In this paper, we show how call centers can improve customer service by implementing personalized priority policies. Under personalized priority policies, managers use customer contact history to predict individual-level caller abandonment and redialing behavior and prioritize them based on these predictions to improve operational performance. We provide a framework for how companies can use individual-level customer history data to capture the idiosyncratic preferences and beliefs that impact caller abandonment and redialing behavior and quantify the improvements to operational performance of these policies by applying our framework using caller history data from a real-world call center. We achieve this by formulating a structural model that uses a Bayesian learning framework to capture how callers’ past waiting times and abandonment/redialing decisions affect their current abandonment and redialing behavior and use our data to impute the callers’ underlying primitives such as their rewards for service, waiting costs, and redialing costs. These primitives allow us to simulate caller behavior under a variety of personalized priority policies and hence, collect relevant operational performance measures. We find that, relative to the first-come, first-served policy, our proposed personalized priority policies have the potential to decrease average waiting times by up to 29% or increase system throughput by reducing the percentage of service requests lost to abandonment by up to 6.3%.

The authors question this conventional wisdom in a common consumer context: upgrade decisions (e.g., whether to upgrade a rental car or hotel room). Seven studies-including one field study-provide empirical evidence for a threshold-crossing effect. When a base product is priced at or just-Above a threshold, consumers are more likely to upgrade and spend more money (studies 1-3) because they perceive the upgrade option as less expensive (study 4), and they place less weight on price (study 5). Testing theoretically motivated and managerially relevant boundary conditions, studies find that the threshold-crossing effect is mitigated under sequential choice (study 6) and when an upgrade price crosses an upper threshold (study 7). These studies demonstrate that a small increase in price on a base product can decrease price perceptions of an upgrade option and, thus, increase consumers' likelihood to upgrade. Results suggest that just-below pricing, while sometimes advantageous at first, may not always be an optimal strategy for managers trying to encourage consumers to ultimately choose an upgrade option. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021","Decision making; Left-digit effect; Pricing; Upgrades",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128829053

When engaging with suppliers in different countries, buyers must manage relationships across various cultures. Prior empirical research has shown that inter-firm power affects opportunism in exchange relationships, and conceptual studies suggest that national culture is a location characteristic that could influence inter-firm power. However, no research has empirically examined the efficacy of inter-firm power in controlling opportunism, or other exchange outcomes, across different cultural contexts. To study this relevant issue, we investigate how a supplier's national culture influences the effectiveness of two bases of inter-firm power, coercive and expert power, on a form of opportunism that has been anecdotally observed in practice—supplier shirking. We utilize primary dyadic data on 109 outsourcing relationships and secondary data of supply chain location characteristics to examine this phenomenon. We find that the effects of inter-firm power on shirking vary across suppliers in different cultures and that, in certain cultures, coercive power may reduce the effectiveness of expert power. Our results show that manufacturers must explicitly consider suppliers' national culture when managing a globally dispersed supply base or risk encountering supplier shirking. © 2022 The Authors.

And how to effectively prioritize varied attributes to be renewed across scales is a challenging process for urban governance worldwide. This study aimed to fill the existing gaps by merging the prioritization capacity of importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the scalability potential of social media data. The study pioneered establishing a social-media-based improvement index (SMII) for urban renewal. Based on the framework of importance-performance analysis, SMII takes the most overkilled point (the lowest importance but the highest performance) as the origin and calculates the area between other points and the origin. SMII always has the highest value in the quadrant with high importance but low performance. We demonstrate the usage of SMII taking the landscape services of urban park systems as an example. We used SMII to understand the users' evaluation of parks' services across scales and then clarified the priority sequence for future renewal. Among selected parks, we identified three parks that need immediate renewal. Among all the services, we found that recreational activities and social interactions are in highest priority for renewal in Beijing's park systems. The findings suggest that the history and culture services of the Old Summer Place Park need to be improved first for a wide variety of reasons. The findings also reveal multiple temporal changes of varied services. Our study concludes that SMII can clarify problem prioritization and cost-effective guide decision-making for urban park renewal with high scalability both temporally and spatially. Meanwhile, SMII can extend its applications to analyzing various issues in the urban environment on multiple scales for the effective allocation of resources during urban renewal. © 2022 The Authors","Beijing parks; Importance-performance analysis (IPA); Landscape services; Social-media-based improvement index (SMII)","Cost effectiveness; Decision making; History; Scalability; Social networking (online); Beijing park; Importance-performance analyse; Importance-performance analysis; Landscape service; Performance; Prioritization; Social media; Social-medium-based improvement index; Urban parks; Urban renewal; Parks; decision making; index method; landscape; landscape change; social media; spatiotemporal analysis; urban renewal; urbanization; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126605540

Currently, how to promote sustainability has become an important priority for policymakers and has attracted great attention from researchers. To evaluate sustainability, this study proposes a new methodological framework. This framework consists of a new data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, concepts of natural and managerial disposability, strong complementary slackness conditions, efficiency Theil index and K-Means clustering method. With the use of this framework, this study obtains unified efficiency measures, technology-based measures, and efficiency inequality measures. These measures assist decision makers in promoting efficiency, mitigating environmental degradation and promoting sustainability. Empirically, this study considers the case of 198 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2016. Five main conclusions are presented. First, Chinese cities improved their unified efficiency scores under both natural and managerial disposability. Second, there is a significant number of occurrences of undesirable congestion, which means that most Chinese cities can save considerable resources during the production process. Third, there is a limited number of occurrences of desirable congestion, implying that only a small portion of Chinese cities have achieved a high level of sustainability. Fourth, efficiency inequality across Chinese cities has gradually decreased over time, where technology diffusion plays an important role.

To date, most studies have examined welfare outcomes at the household level, relying on a relatively narrow range of indicators. There is a need for a more diverse range of metrics to measure the social impacts of oil palm as well as more explicit accounting for study context and gendered effects. Here we demonstrate the utility of specialised time use methods used in combination with qualitative research to understand intra-household labour dynamics associated with oil palm adoption. We use a mixed-methods approach to investigate the role of smallholder oil palm plasma schemes on men and women's time use in Kapuas Hulu District, West Kalimantan. Time allocation is an important determinant of well-being as well as maternal and child nutrition and an indicator of women's empowerment and gender equality. We integrate the results from a fractional multinomial logistic regression of data from 603 individuals with qualitative findings on the subjective experience of time allocation, as well as, the causes, consequences and coping strategies to manage trade-offs in time allocation. We find that relative to non-oil-palm adopting swidden farmers, participation in oil palm plasma schemes is associated with more time spent in productive labour for both men and women, driven by off-farm labour on oil palm plantations. For women, increased time comes at the cost of reduced time spent in rest, leisure and sleep. Increased time spent in off-farm labour drives households to adapt agricultural production methods, changing cash crop production as well as accelerating swidden transitions. These changes alter gender dynamics and responsibilities within the household. Our results suggest that changes in time allocation may have significant consequences for women's well-being and gender equity. Women in the oil palm site experienced greater stress over time scarcity and employed coping strategies more frequently. Our findings indicate that time allocation could be used as an indicator of the effects of oil palm expansion and adoption on well-being and that potential effects of time scarcity on well-being, gender equity, and maternal and child nutrition should be considered by policy makers when making land use decisions. © 2022 The Authors","Forests; Gender; Indonesia; Palm oil; Swidden; Time use","Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Land use; Leisure; Nutrition; Forest; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Mixed method; Oil palm; Swidden; Time use; Time-allocation; Time-spent; Well being; Palm oil; Cultivation; Farm Crops; Indonesia; Land Use; Nutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126393995

By establishing CRO positions, firms can reduce firm risk and potential financial losses caused by operational disruptions. Yet, by inducing stringent control measures on risks, security, and compliance, CRO appointments might create unwieldy bureaucracies with operational hurdles and incur burdensome costs that offset efficiency. Using longitudinal secondary data collected from multiple sources, we analyze the impact of CRO appointments on firm risk and operational efficiency of 435 publicly listed firms in the United States from 2006 to 2016. Our results indicate that CRO appointments not only reduce risks, but also improve efficiency in operations. We delve into the power of CROs and find that more powerful CROs are more effective in enhancing the operational efficiency of firms. We further examine the contextual factors and reveal that firms operating under high industry litigation threats and industry dynamism improve operational efficiency to a greater extent after CRO appointments. Overall, CROs' appointments are more beneficial to firms when they have stronger power in the top management team and when the operating environments are uncertain and volatile. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","chief risk officers; firm risk; industry dynamism; industry litigation threat; operational efficiency; power","Compliance control; Efficiency; Human resource management; Laws and legislation; Risk assessment; Chief risk officer; Corporate level; Firm risk; Industry dynamism; Industry litigation threat; Litigation threats; Operational efficiencies; Power; Risks controls; Top management teams; Losses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126348091

The upstream petroleum sector in the UK shares in these goals, as evidenced by its North Sea Transition Deal and as set out in its sector ‘Roadmap 2035’ for emissions reduction. Participation in an emissions trading scheme as a mechanism for achieving these goals is a key strategy identified in the sector roadmap. Currently, only qualifying installations in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) are charged for their emissions. Notwithstanding, prudent non-qualifying operators are also now incorporating these charges in their financial models for asset valuation purposes. This paper uses a recently updated database of 21 new UKCS fields to examine the effects of carbon emission charges on upstream petroleum operations in the province. We find that emission charges increase operating expenditures, which results (1) an acceleration of the timing of the economic limit of fields, leading to significantly lower petroleum production and carbon emissions; and (2) a reduction in the economic value of petroleum fields hence diminishing the competitiveness of the UKCS. These outcomes advance the energy transition cause of the UK. However, they give rise to major implications for the UK, including energy security, jobs, risk of exposure to a carbon leakage situation, and so on. We advocate a ‘just transition’ approach to energy transition, where petroleum production in the UKCS progresses but with a carbon footprint that is reduced and consistent with an economic optimum. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Emissions; Energy transition; Net zero; Petroleum; UKCS","Binary alloys; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy security; Gasoline; A-carbon; Carbon emissions; Continental shelfs; Effect of carbons; Emission; Energy transitions; Net zero; Petroleum production; Roadmap; UK continental shelf; Emission control; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; energy resource; environmental economics; numerical model; petroleum; valuation; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126091791

Inferring such transitions, which are generally unobserved to the firm, can offer the firms opportunities to be more relevant to their customers. In this paper, we demonstrate how a social network platform can leverage its longitudinal user data to identify which of its users are likely to be job seekers. Identifying job seekers is at the heart of the business model of professional social network platforms. Our proposed approach builds on the hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to recover the latent state of job search from noisy signals obtained from social network activity data. Specifically, we use the latent states of the HMM to fuse cross-sectional survey responses to a job-seeking status question with longitudinal user activity data, resulting in a partially HMM. Thus, in some time periods, and for some users, we observe a direct measure of the true job-seeking status. We demonstrate that the proposed model can predict not only which users are likely to be job seeking at any point in time but also what activities on the platform are associated with job search and how long the users have been job seeking. Furthermore, we find that targeting job seekers based on our proposed approach can lead to a 29% increase in profits of a targeting campaign relative to the approach that was used by the social network platform.

We draw on the intertemporal production decisions of ventures that are quasi-fixed, costly to adjust, and endogenous. Using a modified version of the Bayesian Exponentially Tilted Empirical Likelihood (BETEL) method adjusted for the presence of dynamic latent variables, the proposed moment-based multiple-equation estimation system incorporates dynamic and static optimality conditions derived from a firm's expected intertemporal profit maximization. Using reliable tax information data from a sample of 72,035 Portuguese ventures founded between 2010 and 2017, we find that the most important inputs are labor, equity, and inventories. However, the technical change is small, as is productivity growth. Ventures have a high degree of labor input elasticity but much lower elasticities for equity, inventories, capital, and advertising. The findings provide an understanding of the intertemporal behavior of ventures in managing adjustment costs, input elasticities, and productivity growth where adjustments to efficiency are “cheaper” than adjustments to capital. Labor elasticity is the highest, and productivity growth is very small. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic efficiency; Firms; Intertemporal decision making","Efficiency; Elasticity; Productivity; Profitability; Adjustment costs; Bayesian; Decisions makings; Dynamic efficiency; Firm; Intertemporal decision making; Production decisions; Production models; Productivity growth; Profit maximization; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124398158

However, the characteristics of these novel technologies pose questions about how they can be integrated with existing airport infrastructure. Key considerations relate to the time needed to recharge electric aircraft whilst on the ground without adversely affecting operational capacities, and the requirement for airport operators to install electric charging capabilities. The paper applies queuing theory and simulation modelling techniques to help identify potential battery charging regimes for electric aircraft based on potential forecasts of the future electric aircraft fleet. An initial prototype discrete event simulation model was developed to simulate impacts of short-haul electric aircraft on airport capacity to help determine future infrastructural requirements. Computational optimisation techniques were used to determine optimal configurations of single purpose and converted dual purpose aircraft parking stands under different scenarios and charging regimes. The model demonstrated that a future increase in electric aircraft equating to 25% of the global aircraft fleet required the conversion of only 13% of existing parking stands, while maintaining airside capacity and operational efficiency. The findings have important implications for air transport planners and decision makers in the transition to zero emissions and flight. © 2022","Airport infrastructure; Discrete event simulation; Electric aircraft; Optimization methods; Sustainability; Zero emissions flight","Charging (batteries); Climate change; Decision making; Discrete event simulation; Electric vehicles; Flight simulators; Queueing theory; Sustainable development; Air transport; Aircraft fleets; Airport infrastructure; Airport operations; Discrete-event simulations; Electric aircrafts; Emission saving; Optimization method; Zero emission; Zero emission flight; Computation theory; aircraft; airport; electric vehicle; emission control; optimization; simulation; sustainability; theoretical study; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124328043

While inequality tended to increase during the 1980s and 1990s, it has tended to fall since the early 2000s. In this paper we analyse the correlates of declining income inequality among emerging and developing economies during the 2000s. We estimate country-specific trends in market and disposable income inequality for a large sample of over 100 countries, and then use econometric analysis to examine the correlates of those trends. We find that the tendency toward declining inequality in the 2000s was stronger in countries with higher initial levels of inequality and larger increases in relative agricultural productivity, country-specific primary commodity prices, and remittance inflows. We also find a role for increases in educational attainments, tax revenues and government social spending, and trade liberalisation, but only in Latin America. The results suggest that the challenge now facing many emerging and developing countries is how to sustain the reductions in inequality achieved since the early 2000s, given the decline in commodity prices since 2015, and the social and economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021","Commodity prices; Fiscal policy; Growth; Inequality; Structural change","commodity price; correlation; COVID-19; developing world; econometrics; economic growth; economic impact; fiscal policy; income distribution; structural change; trade liberalization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122428957

However, few studies have addressed this issue in the context of emerging economies. To fill this research gap, this paper explores the TTSs and modes of Chinese NRIs based on a case study of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). We clarify the institutional factors that influence the adoption of an academy-branch-institute-level TTS, reveal the policy-driven evolvement of this multi-level TTS, and elucidate the operational mechanisms of the TTS. We find that the effective collaboration between the actors within or across the three levels of the TTS could enhance the functions of integration management, science and technology (S&T) resource allocation, and public research and development. Through a thematic synthesis approach, we identify three technology transfer modes of the CAS. These three modes exhibit an evolutionary sequence from the CAS-region cooperation mode to the incubation ecosystem mode and then to the platform-driven mode, following the progress of the Chinese S&T system reform and the repositioning of the CAS mission. These modes have diverse demands for technological cognition and resource allocation capability that can be satisfied by the co-specialised interaction among the three levels of the TTS.

We investigated a popular online social game and studied how multiplex social influence jointly affects players' spending time and spending money in a digital freemium environment. We uncovered spending time has a more substantial effect on players' spending money than does spending money. The dependence between two different types of social influence provides evidence of multiplex social influence and its asymmetricity.

The distinctiveness of the study lies in the estimation of default using a framework where firm dynamics are linked to the bankruptcy process itself. The structure builds on theoretical relations among the constructs viewed from a perspective sufficiently wide to demonstrate value addition and dilution. The univariate-based estimation results indicate that the variables determined via the model successfully differentiate distressed firms from non-distressed and other firms, although the evidence from the multivariate analysis facilitate a 90%+ correct distressed/non-distressed classification rate for both 1- and 2-year periods. The findings provide a road map for selecting the most appropriate default prediction variables and identifying the role of each in the prediction process.

Twitter has become a real-time data source for forecasting civil unrest because millions of people use the platform as a social outlet. Daily word counts are used as model features, and predictive terms contextualize the reasons for the protest. To forecast civil unrest and infer the reasons for the protest, we consider the problem of Bayesian variable selection for the dynamic logistic regression model and propose using penalized credible regions to select parameters of the updated state vector. This method avoids the need for shrinkage priors, is scalable to high-dimensional dynamic data, and allows the importance of variables to vary in time as new information becomes available. A substantial improvement in both precision and F1-score using this approach is demonstrated through simulation. Finally, we apply the proposed model fitting and variable selection methodology to the problem of forecasting civil unrest in Latin America. Our dynamic logistic regression approach shows improved accuracy compared to the static approach currently used in event prediction and feature selection. © 2021 International Institute of Forecasters","Civil unrest; Dynamic logistic regression; Forecasting; Penalized credible regions; Pólya-Gamma latent variable",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114260036

A motivating example of such bundles includes the production and delivery of digital content, where variable costs are generally negligible. Specifically, we derive generic lower and upper bounds for the expected revenue function even when accounting for arbitrary, potentially complex, dependence structures among the bundle components. The expected revenue bounds in turn provide upper and lower bounds regarding the optimal pure bundle price. Our results reconcile the extant bundling literature involving expected revenue bounds, while sharpening some of these results even when relaxing the traditional assumption of independence among the valuations for the bundle components. We show how these bounds can be further tightened when the seller has additional information about the dependence relationship. Since these results effectively reduce the search space for the optimal bundle price, the pricing bounds provided by our framework have important managerial implications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","bounds; bundling; information goods; pricing; revenue management","Computer simulation; Ocean engineering; Dependence relationships; Dependence structures; Digital contents; Expected revenue; Information goods; Lower and upper bounds; Managerial implications; Upper and lower bounds; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112674705

Markov Chains are typically used in contexts where a system (e.g. staff profile in a large organisation) is at the start of the planning horizon in a given state, and the aim is to transform the system to a new state by the end of the horizon. The planning horizon can involve several steps and the system transits to a new state after each step. The transition probabilities from one step to the next are influenced by both organisational and external (non-organisational) factors. We develop our generic methodology using as a vehicle the homogeneous Markov manpower planning system. The paper recognizes a gap in existing Markovian manpower planning methods to handle stochasticity and optimization in a more tractable manner and puts forward an approach to harness the power of DEA to fill this gap. In this context, the Decision Maker (DM) can specify potential anticipated future outcomes (e.g. personnel flows) and then use DEA to identify additional feasible courses of action through convexity. These feasible strategies can be evaluated according to the DM's judgement over potential future states of nature and then employed to guide the organisation in making interventions that would affect transition probabilities to improve the probability of attaining the ultimate state desired for the system. The paper includes a numerical illustration of the suggested approach, including data from a manpower planning model previously addressed using classical Markov modelling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Goal programming; Markov manpower planning; Markov processes","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Decision support systems; Linear programming; Markov processes; Planning; Data envelopment; Decisions makings; Goal-programming; Integrated decision; Manpower planning; Markov manpower planning; Markovian; Modelling framework; Planning horizons; Transition probabilities; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111028057

The gaps in the revisionism regarding the relationship between finance and growth are critically teased out, not least neglect of the effects of speculative finance in developing countries where a positive nexus continues to hold sway in the threshold analysis. The paper argues that the literature has focused on pursuit of a positive nexus, with inadequate attention to institutional context, which is prerequisite for enhancing a positive relationship. It has also narrowed drastically the complexity of cause and effect and ignored broader analytical approaches to the relationship between finance and growth. The classical political economy debate on finance productiveness is drawn upon, in which positive contribution is based on real output, as a critical point of departure for why greater emphasis ought to be placed on institutional context to enhance the contribution of finance to growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","economic growth; finance productiveness; financial development; institutions","correlation; developing world; economic growth; financial market; institutional framework; political economy; productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110945057

The spatial allocation of land use constitutes a land-leasing policy operation of local officials, contributing to local economic development and fluctuation. Applying data from 283 prefectural units from 2003 to 2012, this paper explores the existence of land finance cycles, focussing on the changes of the amount (as in ‘area’) of land-leasing by negotiation or by auction. The empirical results suggest that land finance cycles synchronise with the PCCP (Provincial Congress of the Communist Party) cycles, in which a prefectural leader decreases the amount of land leased through negotiation and increases that of land leased through auction prior to the year of the PCCP. The findings of empirical results are consistent with the prediction of our theoretical model. Additionally, due to the existence of high uncertainty of prefectural leaders’ tenure and political turnover, the effect of prefectural leaders’ tenure on land finance cycles is more apparent in the early years of their tenure. The results indicate that Chinese leaders’ fiscal strategies are likely to be driven by career concerns for the purpose of maximising a measured economic performance and fiscal rents. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","fiscal incentives; land conveyance; land finance; land-leasing; prefectural governments","auction; empirical analysis; finance; fiscal policy; incentive; land market; local government; numerical model; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109322436

Drawing on the literature on signaling, we suggest that because a charismatic vision emits a positive signal about the company's future performance, it will affect market actors' reactions by either weakening or strengthening the influence of the signals emitted by other succession context contingencies, namely, CEO origin and succession type.

A time-trend analysis has been employed to identify trends of CB in the respective leagues followed by ANOVA and relevant post-hoc tests to identify difference in concentration measures. A multiple linear regression analysis has been conducted to identify the impact of external economic factors on CB. Findings: Some significant differences were detected in the levels of concentration between leagues. There was also some variation in terms of some leagues being dominated by a fewer number of teams. However, these two measures of competitive balance (concentration and dominance) were not necessarily correlated with each other. The paper also tries to find the optimum number of teams to maintain CB in the women's football leagues in Asia, but an exact figure could not be found.

Therefore, temperature control is a major challenge that cold chain logistics face. Design/methodology/approach: This research proposes a prediction model of refrigerated truck temperature and air conditioner status (air speed and air temperature) based on hybrid mayfly algorithm (MA) and extreme learning machine (ELM). To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, the mayfly algorithm–extreme learning machine (MA-ELM) is compared with the traditional ELM and the ELM optimized by classical biological-inspired algorithms, including the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The assessment is conducted through two experiments, including temperature prediction and air conditioner status prediction, based on a case study. Findings: The prediction method is evaluated by five evaluation indicators, including the mean relative error (MRE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). It can be concluded that the biological algorithm, especially the MA, can improve the prediction accuracy. This result clearly proves the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid prediction model in revealing the nonlinear patterns of the cold chain logistics temperature. Research limitations/implications: The case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed temperature prediction method, which helps to keep the product fresh. Even though the performance of MA is better than GA and PSO, the MA has the disadvantage of premature convergence. In the future, the modified MA can be designed to improve the performance of MA-ELM. Originality/value: In prior studies, many scholars have conducted related research on the subject of temperature monitoring. However, this monitoring method can only identify temperature deviations that have occurred that harmed fresh food. As a countermeasure, research on the temperature prediction of cold chain logistics that can actively identify temperature changes has become the focus. Once a temperature deviation is predicted, temperature control measures can be taken in time to resolve the risk. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cold chain logistics; Extreme learning machine; Mayfly algorithm; Temperature prediction","Air conditioning; Bioinformatics; Errors; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Risk assessment; Temperature; Temperature control; Air conditioner; Case-studies; Cold chain logistics; Fresh food; Genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimizations; Mayfly algorithm; Performance; Prediction methods; Temperature deviation; Temperature prediction; Mean square error",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126056046

Considering the contributing role of innovation systems in the development of new knowledge and technology, it can be stated that the institutional impulse achieved by the European Union through the research framework programmes creates a network of relations between entities and projects. This enables the exchange of information and expertise, which is considered a key element for innovation development. Previous studies have attempted to determine whether institutional impulse is an essential element in understanding the efficiency of innovation systems and their related research policies. However, their investigations have yielded inconclusive results. Using the CORDIS database of the European Commission, this study aims to fill this gap by assessing the European energy innovation system for two periods (2007–2013 and 2014–2020) through two of its research funding programmes—FP7 and H2020—thereby contributing to the literature in the innovation systems field. Social network analysis has been conducted to examine how changes in the institutional impulse, reflected in the new objectives in the research funding programmes, are associated with changes in the structural and topological properties of the innovation systems’ underlying networks. The first contribution indicates that the innovation system responds to changes in the goals of funding programmes, as the taxonomy, topology, and structural properties of their underlying networks underwent modifications due to the newly proposed objectives. The second contribution shows that network properties (cohesion and centrality metrics) can explain the efficiency and effectiveness of innovation systems, drawing useful conclusions for policymakers and individual entities. This last contribution also has important policymaking implications, as it provides the basis for understanding how innovation policy goals can be achieved by changing the institutional impulse to direct the innovation system towards these objectives. © 2022 The Authors","Energy policy; Innovation systems dynamics; Institutional impulse; Research policy; Seventh framework programme; Social network analysis","Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Finance; Social networking (online); Energy; European union; Framework program; Innovation system; Innovation system dynamics; Institutional impulse; Research funding; Research policies; Seventh framework program; Social Network Analysis; Topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123992594

Due to the fuzziness of loss magnitude and the randomness of disaster frequency, fuzzy random variables were employed to characterize economic losses. The model was applied to a case study in high-altitude rural mountainous areas of southwest China during 2016 to 2018. It was found that the impact of geological hazards on SRD was spatially heterogeneous; that is, the degree of impact depends on the socioeconomic development rather than risk magnitude. Assessing the sustainability of SRD required complete identification and classification of area types. In addition, geological hazards would seriously affect the sustainability of the rural areas, especially in areas with less developed transportation and remote terrain. Compared with the sustainable production (SP) stage, the sustainable consumption (SC) stage could generate more economic value. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis; Dual uncertainty; Geologic hazard impact; Sustainable consumption and production; Sustainable rural development","Data envelopment analysis; Disasters; Economic and social effects; Geology; Hazards; Regional planning; Risk assessment; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Dual uncertainty; Environmental damage; Geologic hazard impact; Geologic hazards; Geological hazards; Rural development; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable production; Sustainable rural development; Uncertainty; Losses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123900377

Typically, one seeks to identify individuals to strategically target in a social network so that the network is influenced at aminimal cost. Inmany practical settings, the effects of direct influence predominate, leading to the positive influence dominating set with partial payments (PIDS-PP) problem that we discuss in this paper. The PIDS-PP problem is NP-complete because it generalizes the dominating set problem.We discuss several mixed integer programming formulations for the PIDS-PP problem. First, we describe two compact formulations on the payment space. We then develop a stronger compact extended formulation.We show that when the underlying graph is a tree, this compact extended formulation provides integral solutions for the node selection variables. In conjunction,we describe a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for the PIDS-PP problem on trees.We project the compact extended formulation onto the payment space, providing an equivalently strong formulation that has exponentially many constraints. We present a polynomial time algorithm to solve the associated separation problem. Our computational experience on a test bed of 100 real-world graph instances (with up to approximately 465,000 nodes and 835,000 edges) demonstrates the efficacy of our strongest payment space formulation. It finds solutions that are on average 0.4% from optimality and solves 80 of the 100 instances to optimality. Summary of Contribution: The study of influence propagation is important in a number of applications including marketing, epidemiology, and healthcare. Typically, in these problems, one seeks to identify individuals to strategically target in a social network so that the entire network is influenced at aminimal cost.With the ease of tracking consumers in the smartapp economy, the scope and nature of these problems have become larger. Consequently, there is considerable interest across multiple research communities in computationally solving large-scale influence maximization problems, which thus represent significant opportunities for the development of operations research-based methods and analysis in this interface. This paper introduces the positive influence dominating set with partial payments (PIDS-PP) problem, an influence maximization problemwhere the effects of direct influence predominate, and it is possible to make partial payments to nodes that are not targeted. The paper focuses on model development to solve large-scale PIDS-PP problems. To this end, starting from an initial base optimization model, it uses several operations research model strengthening techniques to develop two equivalent models that have strong computational performance (and can be theoretically shown to be the best model for trees). Computational experiments on a test bed of 100 real-world graph instances (with up to approximately 465,000 nodes and 835,000 edges) attest to the efficacy of the best model, which finds solutions that are on average 0.4% from optimality and solves 80 of the 100 instances to optimality. © 2021 INFORMS.","influence maximization; latency constraints; mixed integer programming; Social networks; strong models","Commerce; Dynamic programming; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Integer programming; Marketing; Polynomial approximation; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Compact extended formulations; Dominating sets; Influence maximizations; Latency constraints; Mixed-Integer Programming; Optimality; Real-world graphs; Social network; Strong model; Test bed; Operations research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134432042

The source data include a history of purchases tagged by customer ID jointly with product availability and promotion data for a category of products. In each customer DAG, nodes represent products and directed edges represent the relative preference order between two products. Upon arrival to the store, a customer samples a full ranking of products within the category consistent with her DAG and purchases the most preferred option among the available ones. We describe the construction process to obtain the DAGs and explain how to mount a parametric, multinomial logit model (MNL) over them. We provide new bounds for the likelihood of a DAG and show how to conduct the MNL estimation. We test our model to predict purchases at the individual level on real retail data and characterize conditions under which it outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.

These observations can be attributed partly to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the growth of passive (systematic) investment strategies and partly to the increased trading intensity of such strategies toward the end of the trading session. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio execution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model that explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity providers trade only portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We find that because of cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a risk-neutral cost-minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a coupled manner, as opposed to the separable volume-weighted average price execution schedule that is often assumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution on the individual stocks so as to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity toward the end of the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from this optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as 15% for plausible model parameters. Finally, we discuss how to estimate cross-sectional price impact if one had a data set of realized portfolio transaction records by exploiting the low-rank structure of its coefficient matrix suggested by our analysis. © 2022 INFORMS","factor model; market impact; market microstructure; optimal execution; portfolio management","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Risk perception; Factor model; Investment strategy; Market impacts; Market microstructures; Optimal execution; Portfolio managements; Price impacts; Price portfolio; Trading intensity; Trading volumes; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133899144

Under these conditions, we examine how to make the most of newly scarce resources in the related problems of curriculum planning and course timetabling. Academic/practical relevance: We propose a unified model for university course scheduling problems under a two-stage framework and draw parallels between component problems while showing how to accommodate individual specifics. During the pandemic, our models were critical to measuring the impact of several innovative proposals, including expanding the academic calendar, teaching across multiple rooms, and rotating student attendance through the week and school year. Methodology: We use integer optimization combined with enrollment data from thousands of past students. Our models scale to thousands of individual students enrolled in hundreds of courses. Results: We projected that if Massachusetts Institute of Technology moved from its usual two-semester calendar to a three-semester calendar, with each student attending two semesters in person, more than 90% of student course demand could be satisfied on campus without increasing faculty workloads. For the Sloan School of Management, we produced a new schedule that was implemented in fall 2020. The schedule allowed half of Sloan courses to include an in-person component while adhering to safety guidelines. Despite a fourfold reduction in classroom capacity, it afforded two thirds of Sloan students the opportunity for in-person learning in at least half their courses. Managerial implications: Integer optimization can enable decision making at a large scale in a domain that is usually managed manually by university administrators. Our models, although inspired by the pandemic, are generic and could apply to any scheduling problem under severe capacity constraints. © 2021 INFORMS","education; optimization; policy modeling; scheduling","Curricula; Decision making; Education computing; Integer programming; Scheduling; Teaching; Condition; Course scheduling; Effective capacity; Integer optimization; Optimisations; Policy model; Problem definition; Scarce resources; Scheduling problem; University campus; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132218780

Academic/practical relevance: Motivated by the challenge of meeting the unpredictable demand surges in E-commerce, we study shipping contracts and supply chain coordination between online sellers and third party shippers in a novel model taking into account the unique features of the shipping industry. Methodology: We compare two shipping contracts: the risk penalty (proposed by UPS) and the flat rate (used by FedEx), and analyze their impact on the seller, the shipper, and the supply chain. Results: Under information symmetry, the sophisticated risk penalty contract is no better than the simple flat rate contract for the shipper, against common belief. Although both the risk penalty and the flat rate can coordinate the supply chain, the risk penalty does so only if the shipper makes zero profit, but the flat rate can provide a positive profit for both. These results represent a new form of double marginalization and risk-sharing, in sharp contrast to the well-known literature on the classic supplier-retailer supply chain, where risk-sharing contracts (similar to the risk penalty) can bring benefits to all parties, but the single wholesale price contract (similar to the flat rate) can achieve supply chain coordination only when the supplier makes zero profit. We also find that only the online seller, but not the shipper, has the motivation to vertically integrate the seller-shipper supply chain. Under information asymmetry, however, the risk penalty brings more benefit to the shipper than the flat rate, but hurts the seller and the supply chain. Managerial implications: Our results imply that information plays an important role in the shipper’s choices of shipping contracts. Under information symmetry, the risk penalty is unnecessarily complex because the simple flat rate is as good as the risk penalty for the shipper; moreover, it is better for the seller-shipper coordination. However, under information asymmetry, the shipper faces additional shipping risk that can be offset by the extra flexibility of the risk penalty. Our study also explains and supports the recent practice of online sellers (e.g., Amazon.com and JD.com), but not shippers, to vertically integrate the supply chain by consistently expanding their shipping capabilities. © 2021 INFORMS","E-Commerce; online retailing; risk-sharing; shipping contracts; supply chain coordination","Electronic commerce; Profitability; Risk management; Risks; Ships; Flat rate; Information asymmetry; Information symmetries; Online retailing; Online sellers; Risk-sharing; Shipping contract; Simple++; Supply chain coordination; Third parties; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127972752

State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy’s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Poor’s 500 Index data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art noninterpretable methods, based on simulation regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure. © 2020 INFORMS","approximate dynamic programming; decision trees; interpretability; optimal stopping; option pricing","Binary trees; Costs; Dynamic programming; Economics; Financial markets; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Application area; Approximate dynamic programming; Approximation problems; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Interpretability; Optimal stopping; Options pricing; Sample average approximation; State-of-the-art methods; Decision trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127891022

Despite the richness of mobile privacy research, the uniformed, rationality-based privacy model commonly employed in prior studies cannot fully explain users’ privacy decisions. Do users think of privacy differently when installing hedonic apps versus utilitarian apps? To answer the question, this paper examines different modes of privacy decision-making contingent on app categories. With a factorial experiment and two post hoc studies, we find that for utilitarian apps, users perform extensive and in-depth processing of both the obvious privacy cue and the subtle privacy cue. Users’ intention to install utilitarian apps is a tradeoff between privacy concerns and perceived app value. For hedonic apps, however, users deliberate on the obvious privacy cue but not the subtle cue. Users place little weight on privacy concerns and mainly consider perceived app value when deciding on hedonic apps. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Hedonic apps; Installation intention; Mode of information processing; Privacy concerns; Utilitarian apps","Behavioral research; Decisions makings; Hedonic app; Installation intention; Mobile app; Mobile users; Mode of information processing; Privacy concerns; Privacy invasions; User privacy; Utilitarian app; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124026981

There is limited research on the effect of health information exchange (HIE) on healthcare outcomes and cost. Analyzing data from the recent past provides us an excellent opportunity to determine EHR and HIE's impact on hospital operations. Purpose: To investigate association between HIT (EHR and HIE) and quality of care, hospital efficiency, and patient flow. Methodology: Multivariable regression models using panel data with year fixed effects and hospital individual effects were used. Outcome variables were readmission index and mortality index (quality of care), cost per inpatient day and cost per inpatient admission (hospital efficiency), and average length of stay (patient flow). We use two variables to measure HIT usage – proportion of functionalities owned/utilized under electronic health records (EHR) and HIE. We use four years of data (2014-17) on 115 acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania from five different data sources. Results: We find evidence for efficiency (lower costs) improvement associated with HIE and for EHR associated with reduced mortality. Also, HIE is adversely associated with mortality. Other effects were not significant. Conclusion: EHR and HIE usage in the hospitals may not be enough or optimal. The healthcare system may also suffer from integration issues. Diffusion of technology is a slow process and users may take time to understand and learn how to apply effectively. Managers and policy makers must be wary of the short- and long-term effect of technology investments on hospital efficiency and quality of care. © 2021 The Authors","EHR; Electronic health records; Health information exchange; Health information technology; HIE; Hospital efficiency; Quality of care","Health care; Hospitals; Information dissemination; Information use; Records management; Regression analysis; Health information exchange; Health information technology; Health informations; Hospital efficiency; Information exchanges; Quality of care; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121965802

Our approach is novel in that we explicitly model spatial variation in parameters in the production-function estimation. We accomplish this by allowing both the input-elasticity and productivity parameters to be unknown functions of the firm's geographic location and estimate them via local kernel methods. This allows the production technology to vary across space, thereby accommodating neighborhood influences on firm production. In doing so, we are also able to examine the role of cross-location differences in explaining the variation in operational productivity among firms. Our model is superior to the alternative spatial production-function formulations because it (i) explicitly estimates the cross-locational variation in production functions, (ii) is readily reconcilable with the conventional production axioms and, more importantly, (iii) can be identified from the data by building on the popular proxy-variable methods, which we extend to incorporate locational heterogeneity. Using our methodology, we study China's chemicals manufacturing industry and find that differences in technology (as opposed to in idiosyncratic firm heterogeneity) are the main source of the cross-location differential in total productivity in this industry. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","agglomeration; firm performance; location; operations efficiency; production function; productivity; proxy variable","Efficiency; Productivity; Cross locations; Firm Performance; Measurements of; Operation efficiencies; Production analysis; Production function; Production function estimations; Proxy variables; Semiparametric; Spatial variations; Location",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121299176

We investigate consumers’ attitudes towards compostable bio-based food packaging, in contrast to fossil-based plastic packaging, framing our study within analysis of implicit attitudes. We address a gap in knowledge about the moderating effects of consumers’ reported health consciousness on the relationship between implicit health associations with compostable packaging and subsequent purchase intentions. Specifically, across four studies employing Implicit Associations Tests (IATs), we analyse the relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes, relating packaging associations with consumers’ behavioural intentions. Our findings confirm positive implicit (and explicit) perceptions of compostable bio-based packaging (vs. fossil-based plastic) regardless of the healthiness of the food contained. This is reflected in consumers’ purchase intentions. We build on this to incorporate the effects of consumers’ self-reported health consciousness. We find that low health-conscious consumers are more likely to be guided in their compostable packaging decisions by their unconscious and automatic health-packaging associations, than consumers with high health consciousness. We contribute to policy discussion about effective ways of reducing fossil-based plastic packaging use and note that environmental claims for non-plastic alternatives aimed at consumers with low-health consciousness should make appeals based on health benefits, tapping into implicit attitudes to evoke automatic responses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Attitudes; Compostable bio-based; Food packaging; Healthiness; Implicit association test; Plastics","Health; Purchasing; Sales; Attitude; Bio-based; Compostable bio-based; Food packaging; Healthiness; Implicit association test; Implicit attitudes; Plastic packaging; Purchase decision; Purchase intention; Packaging; plastic; packaging waste; plastic waste; preference behavior; public attitude; adult; Article; attitude assessment; attitude to health; behavior assessment; composting; consumer attitude; eating habit; environmental impact; female; food packaging; health care policy; health status; human; male; pilot study; self report",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118777722

We apply the structural gravity model to examine GMO trade between the United States and the countries that comprise the rest of the world. Our econometric method includes the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator. We use panel data including measures of countries’ IPR regimes, plant patentability, plant variety rights, GMO regulations and asynchronous approvals of GMOs. Results show the United States tends to export fewer GMO crops to countries with strong IPR regimes, plant patentability and plant variety rights. These results are consistent with the market power effect, where the United States restricts exports to countries with strong protections to extract monopoly prices. Second, enforcement of IPRs strengthens the market power effect. Third, the market power effect is strong alongside with GMO regulations and asynchronous approvals. Fourth, the market power effect is larger for self-pollinating crops vs. hybrids. These findings are robust across a variety of specifications. However, we also find a price premium in countries with less ease of US market access, with more domestic production of GMOs, and with weak traceability requirements.

In doing so, loan originations become prone to closing delays, risking client dissatisfaction and consequent revenue losses. We collaborate with a large national mortgage firm to examine the extent to which these delays are predictable, using internal discussion threads to prioritize interventions for loans most at risk. Substantial work experience is required to predict delays, and we find that even highly trained employees have difficulty predicting delays by reviewing discussion threads. We develop an array of methods to predict loan delays. We apply four modern out-of-the-box sentiment analysis techniques, two dictionary-based and two rule-based, to predict delays. We contrast these approaches with domain-specific approaches, including firm-provided keyword searches and “smoke terms” derived using machine learning. Performance varies widely across sentiment approaches; while some sentiment approaches prioritize the top-ranking records well, performance quickly declines thereafter. The firm-provided keyword searches perform at the rate of random chance. We observe that the domain-specific smoke term approaches consistently outperform other approaches and offer better prediction than loan and borrower characteristics. We conclude that text mining solutions would greatly assist mortgage firms in delay prevention. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.",,"Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Sentiment analysis; Smoke; Analysis techniques; Domain specific; Keyword search; Mortgage loans; Rule based; Work experience; Text mining; article; employee; human; machine learning; mining; prediction; smoke; work experience",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111534921

At the feasibility stage, such analysis is difficult to perform quantitatively due to the substantial uncertainties associated with many of the key influencing criteria. Moreover, changing climate means the renewable energy mix most suited to many regions is also changing as local climates progressively change. A protocol is proposed and evaluated for conducting qualitative multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of multiple clean energy alternatives, suitable for specific regional conditions, using the TOPSIS method. This begins with linguistic assessments of a large number of pertinent criteria (50 or more) taking into account the diverse preferences of the many stakeholders involved. The linguistic assessments are inverted to integer number, fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy scoring (IFS) systems. The IFS method is shown to integrate uncertainty in a more flexible way. The fuzzy and IFS TOPSIS methods adjust their impact matrices with three weight factors: (1) objective weights derived from calculated entropy for each criteria, (2) subjective weights associated with preferences expressed by individual representative stakeholders; (3) subjective weights applied to balance the preferences among stakeholder groups. The three methods are applied using regionally specific case studies to illustrate and compare the clean energy rankings they select for the conditions associated with the specific region evaluated. Fuzzy and IFS scoring systems generate slightly different rankings as they capture uncertainty in different ways. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Entropy weights; Feasibility assessment protocol; Future energy mix; Fuzzy/intuitionistic TOPSIS; Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Policy-maker preferences; Subjective weights","alternative energy; decision analysis; decision making; energy planning; feasibility study; future prospect; fuzzy mathematics; multicriteria analysis; planning method; policy making; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102442360

Analysis of the transitions between these decision-making activities showed that there were marked between-group departures from normative models of decision-making, which predict an orderly transition from SA to PF and then from PF to PE. These departures appeared to reflect between-group differences in the tendency to explore information (evident in reciprocal transitions between SA and PF) or exploit information (apparent in transitions to and from SA and PF to PE).

Findings: The results indicate that the average forecast accuracy improves as a result of judgmental adjustments, but performance of individual forecasters varies considerably based on their personality. Specifically, the trait of openness to experience tends to improve forecast accuracy while extraversion and external locus of control have negative effects. Originality/value: Integration of human judgment with analytics algorithms is a major challenge for organizations. Documenting the impact of these traits on forecast accuracy opens the door for forecasting support system design, training, personnel selection and correction strategies that can be applied to judgmental adjustments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accuracy; Forecasting; Judgment; Locus of control; Personality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111095833

However, at the moment, many companies are collecting large amounts of data without knowing how to systematically exploit it. It is therefore important to find new ways of evaluating and quantifying the value of data. This paper addresses the value of data-based profitability of maintenance investments. Design/methodology/approach: An analytical wasted value of data model (WVD-model) is presented to quantify how the value of data can be increased through eliminating waste. The use of the model is demonstrated with a case example of a maintenance investment appraisal of an automotive parts manufacturer. Findings: The presented model contributes to the gap between the academic research and the solutions implemented in practice in the area of value optimization. The model provides a systematic way of evaluating if the benefits of investing in maintenance data exceed the additional costs incurred. Applying the model to a case study revealed that even though the case company would need to spend more time in analyzing and processing the increased data, the investment would be profitable if even a modest share of the current asset failures could be prevented through improved data analysis.

The key challenge for the UAE is how to encourage and enable organizations, public and private, to embrace innovation as the norm and create a positive environment for innovation. In this context, this study was carried out with the aim of examining the factors that can create innovation–conducive climate in construction and the measures that can be used to assess such a climate. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports research effort to develop and test a conceptual model that hypothesizes relationships amongst different constructs that make up the climate for innovation in UAE organizations, construction and non-construction. In verifying the conceptual model and testing the validity of the hypotheses, a quantitative study was conducted based on data collected via questionnaire survey. A total of 101 respondents participated in the study, majority of whom were employed in private international firms, semi-public firms and private local firms. Findings: The findings showed that, overall, the climate of innovation in the UAE organizations is moderately strong where construction firms performed slightly better than non-construction firms in demonstrating an innovation–conducive atmosphere. In this context, the results found a need for senior management to provide tangible support in terms of providing more resources for the skill base to develop further and seek better ways of developing creative solutions. The main conclusion provided evidence that leadership has positively influenced the climate for innovation and as a result delivered an improved business performance.

Using transaction level data for refrigerators, we first provide reduced-form evidence that prices are impacted by the quota: the negotiated discounts are approximately 3.8% higher if the salesperson is 10% closer to reaching the quota in the final week of the month. Guided by this result, we specify and estimate a demand model that identifies the impact of the quota through two forces: the effort salespeople expend in order to sell the product and their bargaining position. Results indicate that, as salespeople get closer to reaching their quota, their effort increases regardless of the week, and their bargaining position weakens (i.e., they offer lower prices), but only in the final week of the month. We use these results to analyze the impact of the quota and find that, holding salespeoples’ total compensation fixed, eliminating quotas results in 8% lower profit for the retailer. This decrease stems primarily from the reduction in effort that outweighs any benefit from strengthening the salespeoples’ bargaining position. The change in profit is economically meaningful because eliminating both price negotiation (i.e., moving to fixed pricing) and the quota results in an up to 36% reduction in profit. © 2021 INFORMS","bargaining; compensation structure; price delegation; pricing; revenue-based quota; salespeople","Profitability; Sales; % reductions; Bargaining; Compensation structure; Demand modelling; Lowest price; Price delegation; Price negotiations; Revenue-based quota; Salespeoples; Transaction level; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132690377

To alleviate the suspicions and convince consumers of their value, the firm may design its personalization scheme to include a list price in addition to the personalized prices. We find that only a separating equilibrium with list pricing survives the intuitive criterion. Specifically, when consumers underestimate their value, it is essential to use a binding list price to inform the consumers about the market’s price ceiling.

Existing studies, however, have reported mixed findings on whether Millennials differ from their predecessor generations, leading to contradictory conclusions drawn for transportation planning and policy recommendations. This study utilized eight U.S. national travel surveys to construct a panel data that covers a continuous range of ages for persons five years and older for Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. With this unique dataset, the study performed analyses on the trend of daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by an average person from each generation and its subgroups. The study found that Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials shared a three-phased trending pattern of VMT over the life course but exhibited varying levels of daily VMT in different life stages. During adulthood, Millennials have kept their daily VMT consistently lower than that of Generation X by about 3 VMT, or 8%, whereas the younger group of Baby Boomers outdrove the older Millennials at age 28 and after by about 3.5 VMT, or 9% daily. When each generation is considered over its life course, peak-level daily VMT tends to occur at earlier ages for each successive generation. From the multi-level modeling of daily VMT, the study identified generation-related group effects and estimated VMT elasticities with respect to person age, driving licensure, vehicle ownership, household size, and gasoline price-adjusted income. The study's findings on the direction and size of VMT influences associated with the five planning or policy variables did not support the speculation that Millennials would match or surpass Baby Boomers and Generation X in their future daily VMT trajectory. Public policies should be designed to nurture the shifting trend of reduced automobility from the older to the younger generations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Baby boomers; Generation X; Millennials; National Household Travel Survey (NHTS); Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS); Vehicle miles traveled (VMT)","Surveys; Baby boomer; Generation X; Millennials; National household travel survey; National household travel surveys; Nationwide personal transportation survey; Personal transportation; Transportation surveys; Vehicle mile traveled; Vehicle-miles traveled; Vehicles; adult; panel data; transportation planning; travel behavior; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121632225

Like elsewhere in different parts of the world, African countries have been exploring different approaches, institutional reforms, models and mechanisms towards more efficient and effective funding and financing of research and innovation to enhance their individual and collective economic development aspirations. This paper derives from a 2018 to 2019 study which used a combination of primary and secondary data sources to inform current debates and reviews on the re- organization of research and innovation funding in Africa. Attempts to copy experiences of high income economies in harnessing and deploying funding mechanisms into national research and innovation systems are not appropriate if not accompanied by adaptation to systemic and contextual aspects in receiving countries and sectors. This paper presents and analyses recent empirical evidence from 15 African countries to argue that successful adaptations are not just a matter of technological and innovation capabilities, timely and adequate resourcing, but are a function of decision-making and governance capabilities, which in turn arise from deliberate and interactive learning across the entire research and innovation system. This work contributes to some of the themes covered in this journal recently on the broad issue of resources for innovation, including financial and relational resources. © 2021","Africa; Funding; Governance capabilities; Innovation; Research","Decision making; Economics; Africa; Economic development; Fundings; Governance capability; Innovation; Innovation system; Institutional reforms; Primary data source; Research system; Science research; Finance; decision making; economic development; governance approach; innovation; research work; technology adoption; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121112965

Subsequently, this might have implications for the consumption of households and the investments of corporations. Therefore, trust could mitigate the negative impact of financial stress on economic growth. To test this hypothesis, we use a sample of EU countries over the period 2002–2020 and examine the interaction of trust with financial stress in shaping GDP growth. The interaction term enters the estimations with a positive and statistically significant coefficient, and it therefore mitigates the negative impact of financial stress on economic growth. Furthermore, by disaggregating the GDP into its four main components, we find that the moderating effect of trust flows through the two main components of GDP mentioned above, namely households’ consumption and firms’ investments. Additionally, we observe that the interaction effect becomes weaker in countries with a higher economic freedom and is strengthened in centre and left-wing governments compared to right-wing economically oriented ones. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"accessibility; economic growth; finance; Gross Domestic Product; household expenditure; investment; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120410849

Using ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) Ice Bucket Challenge as a case study, we explored the triggering factors for sharing content and donating money that resulted in the campaign's phenomenal success. The hybridity inherent across crowdfunding models has meant that there are diverse motivations and incentives for people to participate in a crowdfunding campaign. It is therefore important to understand what factors lead social media / online information to reach a wider audience in the shortest possible time. Following a literature review, a theoretical model of motivating factors was developed and tested through an online survey amongst 469 US participants. The results indicate significant relationships between those who participated / donated and the modelled factors. Personalization and message involvement are the strongest factors for sharing, whereas moral obligation to donate is strongest for donating.

There is a lack of generalizability in the current validity indexes (VI) for automatic clustering algorithms, as each considers a limited number of objectives and mostly ignores the other aspects of clustering validation. The proposed framework benefits from collaboration among selected evolutionary algorithms. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, and a framework is proposed for a six-step decision support system to solve it. The decision-maker (DM) selects the quantitative (primary) VIs and the evolutionary algorithms. Given DM's knowledge on the dataset and VIs, DM can incorporate qualitative (secondary) VIs. DM determines the quality threshold for each VI and runs the evolutionary algorithms separately. The DSS then saves the best obtained value of VIs in order to prepare the input necessary to construct the aggregated function. Based on the selected primary VIs, a new normalized aggregated function is developed and solved repeatedly using the randomly selected or predefined weights of importance. Eventually, DM employs a proper DEA model to define the final clustering output among all possible solutions. Given multiple efficient solutions, the best-worst method and a multi-criteria decision-making approach are applied to find the final output. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated on a synthetic and two secondary datasets, and the result at each step is discussed in detail. © 2021","Automatic clustering; BWM; DEA; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective","Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Decision support systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Automatic clustering; BWM; Clusterings; Collaborative decisions; DEA; Decision makers; Multi objective; Multi-criteria; Multi-Criterion; Validity index; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115756784

Socioeconomics is one of the drivers for disaster resilience since disaster events affect the social and economic growth of cities. Although many research studies addressed disaster preparedness, recovery, and other aspects of resilience, few have been dedicated to addressing socioeconomic resilience (SER) and even fewer addressed quantifying SER, presenting a problem that needs to be addressed. The objective of this research is focused on creating a standardized framework that quantifies and can compare, the SER of cities. The research efforts identify and establish the key performance indicators (KPI) through a content analysis followed by thematic analysis to create a final list of validated socioeconomic KPIs. The research results provide a threefold contribution to the research body of knowledge. Firstly, a standardized quantification mechanism, specific to the US, is created for assessing the SER of cities, which was further validated and piloted over three different cities as a case study. Secondly, the research introduces several improvement measures for each socioeconomic indicator which can help in restoring and improving these indicators and consequently the overall SER status. Finally, the research introduces an extensive list of different approaches for engaging and acquiring citizen buy-in to those improvement measures. The outcomes of this research can be used by city officials, policymakers, and community leaders among many other stakeholders to identify the weaknesses in their socioeconomic structure and implement measures to mitigate them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen engagement; Improvement; Key performance indicators (KPIs); Socioeconomic","economic growth; quantitative analysis; social development; socioeconomic indicator; stakeholder; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113373627

However, such social media information is not applicable to business-to-business (B2B) industries, as a result of a lack of end-consumer evaluations. This raises a few interesting questions, including whether there may be any external information that could be used to improve B2B demand forecasting, and whether practical approaches may be possible to collect and utilize useful external business information. In this study, we develop an innovative and intelligent demand forecasting approach and apply it to a B2B server company based in the United States. We first implemented time series and machine learning models based on sales data and selected the best-fitting model as a baseline, and then used a web crawler and Google Trends to collect related market signals as external information indices for the server industry, which were finally incorporated into the selected baseline model to adjust forecasting results to account for demand fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that the baseline model achieved an out‐of‐sample mean squared error (MSE) of 19.77 without considering the collected external information indices, and 11.87 when external information was incorporated. Therefore, our proposed approach significantly improved forecasting accuracy, demonstrating an improvement of 63.1% in terms of MSE, 44.1% in terms of mean absolute error, and 61.2% in terms of root mean square percentage error. Thus, this study sheds light on the value of external information in demand forecasting for B2B industries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand forecasting; External information; Google trends; Machine learning; Market signal; Time series","Errors; Mean square error; Social networking (online); Web crawler; Business information; Business to business; Business to customers; Demand fluctuations; External informations; Forecasting accuracy; Machine learning models; Social media informations; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112568620

In order to further improve the prediction performance while considering the data fluctuation, in this study, the wavelet de-noising is introduced to pre-processing the EC data as the input of a modified grey model, leading to an improved novel grey model WD-TBGM (1, 1). It is found that using a wavelet decomposition algorithm can denoise the data and then the data fluctuation is effectively reduced. After illustrating effectiveness by numerical simulation and case study, the prediction performance of this newly proposed hybrid model can be enhanced with approximately 5% compared with the classical grey models. Furthermore, this newly proposed hybrid model is used to address the issues of EC prediction in China which is one of the worldwide top ten energy consumers and in Shanghai city which is one of the top energy consumers in China. The forecasting results show that the total EC of China and Shanghai will slow down in the next few years, which is in line with their actual development situation.

Design/methodology/approach: Using actual operational data from 2014 to 2018, this paper measures the relative efficiencies of aircraft by data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. To analyze the efficiencies across different operational units and among aircraft with different attributes, non-parametric statistical techniques and tobit regression are employed. Findings: The overall management of maintenance man-hour turns out to be 63.2% efficient compared to the best practice. Operational unit possessing aircraft with different configurations shows the poorest performance implying efficiency depends on the complexity of job processes. Identification of aircraft on the best-practice frontier indicates the efficiency is closely related with the reliability of components and the age of aircraft. Practical implications: Performance of aircraft maintenance has a tremendous impact on military readiness, utilization of work force, and the quality and safety of flight operations. This study confirmed there exists plenty of room for performance enhancement and presents a reference to find a balance in the performances of maintenance practices across different installations as well as among different types of aircraft. Originality/value: Application of DEA to engineering systems has been limited in literature, especially in military operations.

Because of this, responsible management education and learning (RMEL) must integrate poverty as a threshold concept on which students’ cognitive frame is built. Design/methodology/approach: This paper advocates for poverty to be taught as a multidimensional threshold concept that encompasses a person’s freedoms and capabilities, in addition to their income (Sen, 1999). Further, this paper provides a framework for integration into all curricula grounded in RMEL’s unique domain of inquiry and study: the integration of ethics, responsibility and sustainability. Findings: Threshold concepts transform student learning in durable, immutable ways. When poverty is taught as such, students develop more elaborate poverty cognitive frames that they can apply across their entire course of study. This paper describes how to: (1) reframe poverty as a threshold concept; (2) apply Biggs’ (2003) framework of constructive alignment to assure the integrity of course learning objectives and the curriculum; (3) create poverty-related assignments that are emotionally engaging and relevant for students (Dart, 2008); and (4) use this proposed framework of including poverty in business classes. Research limitations/implications: Without an integrated multidimensional understanding of poverty, students will not emerge as managers competent in addressing these critical issues from within a business context (Grimm,2020). It will be imperative in future research to evaluate the outcomes of doing so and to determine whether this solution creates responsible managers more competent in addressing poverty-rooted issues. Originality/value: This paper brings together two elements of student learning central to understanding poverty: threshold concepts and cognitive frames. This paper also uses Biggs’ (2003) constructive alignment framework to assure that curricular and course changes have both internal coherence and explicit learning outcomes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cognitive frames; Economics; Marketing; Poverty; Threshold concept",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123214287

Central to the argument is the idea that on such complex projects, the client cannot outsource systems integration and thus needs to recognise they retain accountability, though roles and responsibilities can be assigned to the delivery partner, supply chain, chief engineer and/or contracted systems integration firm. A key question for the client at the outset is how to distribute interface management and systems integration responsibilities while retaining accountability and oversight. Rather than managing through contracts, budgets and schedules, the authors suggest a changed approach with priority given to managing integration, and contracts, budgets and schedules that support and incentivise this. © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","management; procurement; project management","Budget control; Integration; Integration testing; Commissioning phase; Complex infrastructures; Configuration control; Infrastructure project; Major project; Manage system integrations; Setting outs; System integration; System integration model; Testing phase; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120861568

Managers usually rely on surveys, intuition, and heuristics to forecast new products. Linear statistical tools used to predict demand for existing products are not suitable because there are not enough data to capture complex nonlinear relations in yet-to-be launched products. Other tools are appropriate for aggregate new categories but not for incremental company-specific products. Machine learning can capture complex nonlinear relations, but it usually requires significant amounts of data. Using an expert’s domain knowledge can circumvent the need for vast training datasets. To support product development activities, we propose a method that combines domain knowledge and machine learning to forecast market share of complex incremental new products. An experiment from the automobile industry shows the approach yields expressive results (82 percent forecast accuracy). © Copyright © 2022, Innovation Research Interchange.","Artificial neural network; Domain knowledge; Machine learning; New product forecasting; Product concept","Commerce; Competition; Complex networks; Domain Knowledge; Forecasting; Machine learning; Neural networks; Statistical mechanics; Complex nonlinear relation; Domain knowledge; Domain machines; Knowledge learning; Machine-learning; New product forecasting; Product concepts; Product demand; Product forecasting; S-domain; Automotive industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130762054

Recent research has examined the interaction between technology and the key job outcomes of employees. But this research stream has done so using a linear lens even though this interplay has been recognized to be dynamic and complex. We challenge here this linearity assumption. We theorized that enterprise system (ES) use influences post-implementation job scope, and the change from pre- to post-implementation job scope perceptions will have a complex effect on job outcomes that are best captured by a polynomial model. Drawing on the anchoring-and-adjustment perspective in decision-making research, our polynomial model highlights the dynamic nature of employee reactions to changes in job scope brought about by an ES implementation that cannot be captured by traditional linear models. We found support for our model using data collected in a longitudinal field study from 2,794 employees at a telecommunications firm over a period of 12 months. Our findings highlight the key role an ES implementation can have in changing the nature of jobs and how those changes can, in turn, drive job performance and job satisfaction. This research also extends classical job characteristics research by arguing for a more complex relationship between the scope and outcomes of technology-supported jobs. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","enterprise systems; Job outcomes; job performance; job satisfaction; longitudinal filed study; system post-implementation; technology-supported jobs","Behavioral research; Decision making; Digital storage; Enterprise resource planning; Enterprise system; Enterprise system implementation; Job outcome; Job performance; Longitudinal filed study; Polynomial models; Post-implementation; Recent researches; System post-implementation; Technology-supported job; Job satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128347659

This has generated a plethora of public policies aimed at creating and developing EEs, frequently without solid theoretical and empirical foundations for its design, with consequent policies risking being ineffective. To address this, we develop theory through a systematic synthesis of qualitative studies, exploring a set of EEs, from different countries, dimensions, and characteristics. Our evidence-based approach diverges from extant studies that frequently examine a single ecosystem. The results of the systematic synthesis led us to propose a typology of ideal-types of intervention, the ecologist, the creator, the promoter and the landscaper. These provide a path towards the development of a better understanding of the type of dominant policy intervention in EE, also enabling the study of policy evolution and its alternative trajectories regarding future development. By using an evidence-based analysis, we enhance coherence through incorporating diverse perspectives not as conflicting or contradictory, but as part of a structured set of policymaking options.

Reconciling these perspectives, we theorize that intermediate levels of domain experience are optimal for algorithm-augmented performance, due to the interplay between two countervailing forces-ability and aversion. Although domain experience can increase performance via increased ability to complement algorithmic advice (e.g., identifying inaccurate predictions), it can also decrease performance via increased aversion to accurate algorithmic advice. Because ability developed through learning by doing increases at a decreasing rate, and algorithmic aversion is more prevalent among experts, we theorize that algorithm-augmented performance will first rise with increasing domain experience, then fall. We test this by exploiting a within-subjects experiment in which corporate information technology support workers were assigned to resolve problems both manually and using an algorithmic tool. We confirm that the difference between performance with the algorithmic tool versus without the tool was characterized by an inverted U-shape over the range of domain experience. Only workers with moderate domain experience did significantly better using the algorithm than resolving tickets manually. These findings highlight that, even if greater domain experience increases workers' ability to complement algorithms, domain experience can also trigger other mechanisms that overcome the positive ability effect and inhibit performance. Additional analyses and participant interviews suggest that, even though the highest experience workers had the greatest ability to complement the algorithmic tool, they rejected its advice because they felt greater accountability for possible unintended consequences of accepting algorithmic advice. © 2021 INFORMS","Algorithmic aversion; Algorithms; Automation; Decision making; Domain experience; Experts; Future of work; Machine learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125590211

We empirically investigate the best way to help agents perform better. Academic/practical relevance: BOP customers represent one-third of the world's economy but make five United States dollars or less daily. Providing goods and services to these customers is difficult for traditional firms because most retail activity occurs at small-scale independent outlets. Improving agent performance can help firms reach customers in this environment. We enhance the literature on agent-based models in BOP settings, decision making, technology in developing economies, and field experiments. Methodology: In partnership with a Tanzanian mobile money operator, we perform a randomized, controlled trial with 4,771 agents to examine how differing types of guidance, and whether in-person training is offered, impact agents' inventory management. Mobile money is a platform whereby firms in developing economies provide financial services to customers via cell phones. Mobile money agents service customer withdrawals and deposits as branchless banking outlets. Every day, they decide how much money to stock to service customers' transactions, from which they earn commissions. Results: We find that those agents given only explicit recommendations (as opposed to summary statistics or both) who were invited to in-person training (as opposed to simply received an automated notification) improve their performance. Agents in other treatments showed no statistically significant change. The effect is concentrated in agents who never replenished their money at a bank and whose money inventory levels were low in the pretreatment period. Managerial implications: We show empirically how firms can better manage agents, thereby improving the value proposition of serving BOP customers. We show the utility of segmentation based on agent heterogeneity. This can improve firm performance, agent profits, and customer service.

Academic/practical relevance: In the class of random utility maximization choice models, consumers choose the alternative with the largest utility after resolving utility uncertainties for all options. However, in practice, consumers may not inspect all available alternatives due to bounded rationality or search cost. Methodology: This paper incorporates bounded rationality into consumer choice behavior: in the first stage, a representative consumer forms her consideration set by removing alternatives whose nominal utility is lower than the largest by a threshold; in the second stage, she examines all alternatives in her consideration set and chooses the one with the highest realized utility. Results: For the Gumbel-distributed random utilities, we derive the two-stage threshold multinomial logit model with a consideration set. For the pricing problem, we show the quasi-same-markup/same-utility policy is optimal: high-cost products charge the prices such that their profit markups are the same, and low-cost products charge prices such that their nominal utilities are the same. For the price competition, there may exist zero, one, two, or infinite Nash equilibria, depending on the magnitude of the threshold effects. Managerial implications: Our analysis shows that the consideration set and bounded rationality play an important role in consumer choice behavior, so they should be taken into account in firms’ decision making.

I shed light on these predictions by estimating the impact of public data from Landsat, a U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite mapping program, on the discovery rates of new deposits by incumbents (seniors) and entrants (juniors) in the gold exploration industry. I exploit idiosyncratic timing variation and cloud cover in Landsat coverage across regions to identify the causal effect of public data on the patterns of gold discovery.

Two distinct behavioral economics theories, the trust-embedded model and the level-k model, have emerged to explain how cheap talk works between human decision makers. The trust-embedded model considers that decision makers are motivated by nonpecuniary motives to be trusting and trustworthy. In contrast, the level-k model considers that decision makers are purely self-interested but limited in their ability to think strategically. Although both theories have been successful in explaining cheap-talk behaviors in separate contexts, they point to contrasting drivers for human behaviors. In this paper, we provide the first direct comparison of both theories within the same context. We show that, in a cheap-talk setting that well represents many practical situations, the two models make characteristically distinct and empirically distinguishable predictions.We leverage past experiment data from this setting to determine what aspects of cheap-talk behavior each model captures well and which model (or combination of models) has better explanatory power and predictive performance. We find that the trust-embeddedmodel emerges as the dominant explanation. Our results, thus, highlight the importance of investing in systems and processes to foster trusting and trustworthy relationships in order to facilitate more effective cheaptalk interactions. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

The sensors measure an important operating-condition state variable, but their measurements are noisy, so estimates are imperfect. Sensors can improve their own estimates by soliciting estimates from other sensors. The choice of which sensors to communicate with (target) is challenging because sensors (1) are constrained in the number of sensors they can target and (2) only have partial knowledge of how other sensors operate-that is, they do not know others' underlying inference algorithms/models. We study the targeting problem, examine the evolution of interfirm sensor communication patterns, and explore what drives the patterns. Academic/practical relevance: Many industries are increasingly using sensors to drive improvements in key performance metrics (e.g., asset uptime) through better information on operating conditions. Sensors will communicate among themselves to improve estimation. This IoT vision will have a major impact on operations management (OM), and OM scholars need to develop and examine models and frameworks to better understand sensor interactions. Methodology: Analytic modeling combining decision-making, estimation, optimization, and learning is used. Results: We show that when selecting its target(s), each sensor needs to consider both the measurement quality of the other sensors and its level of familiarity with their inference models. We establish that the state of the environment plays a key role in mediating quality and familiarity. When sensor qualities are public, we show that each sensor eventually settles on a constant target set, but this long-run target set is sample-path dependent (i.e., dependent on past states) and varies by sensor. The long-run network, however, can be fully defined at time zero as a random directed graph, and hence, one can probabilistically predict it. This prediction can be made perfect (i.e., the network can be identified in a deterministic way) after observing the state values for a limited number of periods. When sensor qualities are private, our results reveal that sensors may not settle on a constant target set but the subset among which it cycles can still be stochastically predicted. Managerial implications: Our work allows managers to predict (and influence) the set of other firms with which their sensors will form information links. Analogous to a manufacturer mapping its supplier base to help manage supply continuity, our work enables a firm to map its sensor-based-information suppliers to help manage information continuity.

Industrial experiments may include both quality and reliability characteristics with the goal to obtain a compromise optimization of the two responses. In many cases, such experiments do not use a completely randomized design. Instead, they involve a more complicated experimental protocol, for example, subsampling, blocking, and split-plot structure. This paper presents a framework for the simultaneous optimization of quality and reliability characteristics with random effects. The paper provides a linear mixed model for quality characteristic and a nonlinear mixed model for Type I censored lifetime to incorporate random effects in the analysis. Subsequently, the desirability function approach is used to obtain a trade-off between the quality and reliability characteristics. The mixed models in this paper can incorporate information from all censored test stands and random effects. The proposed framework provides engineers with an appropriate approach to simultaneously optimize the quality and reliability characteristics with random effects. The paper used a case study to illustrate the proposed framework.

Left unchecked, stresses and diseases can spread and propagate to nearby plants, causing even more damage, necessitating early detection. To address this challenge, the Agricultural Robotic System for Plant Stress Propagation Detection (ARS/PSPD) is developed. In this cyber-physical system, the robot agents are assigned scanning tasks to detect stresses in greenhouse plants. The problem of plant stress propagation detection is formulated with disruption propagation network modelling, which captures the plant stress occurrence and propagation mechanisms. The network modelling enables better situation awareness and augments the development of advanced collaborative scanning protocols. Five collaborative scanning protocols are designed and implemented in this research, with one protocol serving as a baseline, three protocols utilising disruption propagation network analysis, and one protocol utilising Bayesian network inference. The scanning protocols minimise errors and conflicts in scanning task allocation and enable better plant stress detection. The five ARS/PSPD collaborative scanning protocols are validated with numerical experiments, using agricultural greenhouses as experiment settings. The experiments show that the scanning protocol using Bayesian network inference outperforms all other protocols in all scenarios, with 16.92% fewer undetected plant stresses and 12.28% fewer redundant scans. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian methods; Bayesian network; cyber-physical systems; disruption propagation; plant stress","Agriculture; Bayesian networks; Cyber Physical System; Damage detection; Greenhouses; Internet protocols; Productivity; Scanning; Stresses; Agricultural robotics; Bayesia n networks; Bayesian methods; Bayesian Network inference; Disruption propagation; Model networks; Network models; Plant stress; Robotic systems; Stress propagation; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121432455

By focusing on the recurrent disruptions, we argue that imputed buyers' attributions of responsibility are characterized by disruptions' recurrent nature and locus of causality—whether the disruptions were repeatedly triggered by recurrent events internal or external to the supplier. Furthermore, while previous studies have identified either buyers' attributions of disruptions or suppliers' justice approaches (to resolve disruptions) as independent factors driving buyers' decisions, we integrate attribution and justice theories and investigate their combined effect—how responsibility attributions affect buyers' switching intentions given suppliers' justice approaches. Using three vignette-based studies of 705 purchasing managers (supplemented by three robustness check studies), we show that distributive justice attenuates the damaging impact of disruptions triggered by suppliers' internal incidents (internal locus) on buyers' switching intentions, whereas procedural and interactional justice are more instrumental in disruptions triggered by external events (external locus). We conclude by offering substantive guidance for suppliers regarding appropriate actions in preserving the relationship. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",,"Supply chain management; Causality; Combined effect; Justice; Locus of causality; Recurrent events; Responsibility attribution; Supply-induced disruption; Switching intentions; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120310709

As communities and their challenges become more complex, new sets of mixed research tools that critically investigate these issues as whole systems rather than isolated parts are crucial for future decision makings. In light of this, mixed research approaches offer the chance to overcome most of the limitations of individual methods and provide potential solutions to complicated problems that are more in-depth than a single form of research method. In this paper, by drawing on the complementary characteristics of Causal Layered Analysis and Participatory System Dynamics, a mixed approach for investigating the future behaviors of complex socio-economic systems and exploring the effectiveness of various policy interventions over time is proposed. Moreover, Iran's brain drain case study is presented for further assessment of the proposed approach. The implication of the proposed approach to skills mobility or the so-called brain drain phenomenon is the undisputable role of human capital efficiency in the future developments of the nation. Through this approach, in the first step, an issue is critically analyzed and unpacked into four layers, namely as litany, structure, worldview, and metaphor. In the second step, a participatory approach is implemented to systematically model the issue based on the results of the previous step via five stages. The utility of this approach is its ability to critically examine the future behaviors of complex systems under the effect of different policy interventions and scenarios. Therefore, the proposed approach will generate theoretical value for researchers in the field of futures studies and harbor practical value for policymakers who seek a better mechanism to critically investigate complex socio-economic systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Brain drain; Causal layered analysis; Mixed research approach; Participatory system dynamics modelling; Skills mobility","brain drain; decision making; human capital; participatory approach; research work; socioeconomic survey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118866978

The proliferation of platforms with distributed content production, such as Wikipedia, Zooniverse, and others, has led to scholarly interest in understanding why individuals contribute to them. One stream of research has investigated contributor motivations, while another growing stream, scattered across several disciplines, has explored the effect of platform design on contributions. One important design element is the extent to which incomplete, or partial, contributions are possible - a concept we refer to in this paper as “tolerance to incompleteness.” We explore the relationship between this design element and crowds’ willingness to contribute in the context of Zooniverse, the world's largest citizen science platform. Our quasi-experimental empirical approach exploits a format change that decreased tolerance to incompleteness in one Zooniverse project. The results of a difference-in-differences estimation show that after the format change, editors contributed fewer total edits, but more complete edits than predicted in the absence of a change. Users also spent less time contributing to the project post-change. Moreover, we find a trade-off between the quantity and quality of complete edits, with the quality of complete edits lower post-change. Our findings have implications for the design of a growing number of crowdsourcing platforms that involve simple, independent, and well-structured tasks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Citizen science; Crowdsourcing; Difference-in-differences; Natural experiment; Zooniverse","Economic and social effects; Citizen science; Content production; Design elements; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Distributed content; Format change; Natural experiment; Platform design; Zooniverse; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118849360

Markov Switching Regression, VAR Granger causality and variance decomposition analysis applied on the given dataset. The results show that the COVID-19 cases have a rebound effect on environmental quality. Economic activities started after a lifted lockdown, and unsustainable production and consumption led to a deteriorating natural environment. The U-shaped relationship is found between carbon pollution and per capita income. On the other hand, the inverted U-shaped relationship is found between coronavirus cases and carbon pollution. The foreign direct investment inflows and population density increases carbon pollution.

Prior empirical operations management studies generally treat product variety as a single-dimensional measure (e.g., the number of SKUs carried by the store, distribution center, or firm) and study its impact on aggregate sales (e.g., sales at the store, distribution center, or firm). As such, SKUs from different brands are assumed to contribute equally to total sales, which is not always the case. To address this, we need to conceptualize product variety within brands and investigate its impact on sales at a more granular level. In this study, we propose and theoretically articulate two product variety dimensions (within-brand variety [WV] and average WV of other brands [AWVO]) to investigate the mechanisms that connect product variety to SKU-level sales. Using a detailed transaction dataset from a local grocery retailer, we first show that product variety conceptualized within brands (i.e., the mean of WVs [MWV]) does have an impact on aggregate subcategory sales, as the literature suggests. At the SKU level, we find WV increases same-brand SKU sales, while AWVO reduces it. Our work provides an alternative explanation to the inverted U-shaped relationship between product variety and aggregate sales observed in the literature: Increasing variety only increases sales of SKUs belonging to the brand whose variety has increased, while it decreases sales of the other SKUs. We also find that variety effects vary significantly across different profitability levels and product categories. Product variety appears to have the strongest positive effect on high-margin products. The impact of product variety on specific product category sales varies from as high as 11% to negligible. We further discuss the practical value of our findings and show the robustness of our results through multiple tests while addressing endogeneity using the control function approach. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",,"Aggregates; Profitability; Warehouses; Category contingency; Differential effect; Distribution centres; Empirical operations managements; Grocery stores; Product categories; Product variety; Profitability contingency; Stock keeping unit; Stock-keeping unit-level analyse; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118175387

The results, based on an augmented Solow model and the system-generalized method of moments (GMM), reveal that the impact of tourism on city-level economic growth is indeed asymmetric and heterogeneous, depending on the presence of top-level attractions (TL), which are proxied by the World Heritage Sites or AAAAA (5A) scenic spots. The dynamic panel threshold model’s results also corroborate the asymmetric threshold effect of tourism on city-level economic growth. Tourism, in particular, has facilitated positive and significant economic growth in cities with TL but has had an uncertain and statistically insignificant impact on cities without it. The findings indicate that the validity of tourism-led growth depends on the availability and number of TL in each city, which serve as a moderator. As a result, we confirm tourism’s asymmetric effect and spatial heterogeneity on urban economic growth. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asymmetry effect; economic growth; spatial heterogeneity; threshold model; top-level attractions; tourism","asymmetry; economic growth; heterogeneity; panel data; tourism; tourist attraction; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117227633

Using a sample of Chinese listed commercial banks over the period 2005 − 2018, this research conducted pooled OLS and found evidence that economic uncertainty significantly increases bank risk and lowers profitability. Furthermore, we constructed a partial equilibrium model to explain how risk governance alters the risk-increasing effect and profit-decreasing effect of economic uncertainty on bank risk and profitability. Consistent with theory, empirical results suggested the effects of economic uncertainty on bank risk and performance tend to be considerably weaker when there exists a strong risk governance mechanism. These findings stand when subjected to several endogeneity and robustness checks. Risk governance plays a key role in weakening the detrimental consequences of economic uncertainty on banks and promoting a sustainable growth of the banking sector. A financial regulator entity should require banks to establish a sound risk governance system in order to mitigate financial systemic risk and safeguard overall financial stability. © 2021 The Author(s).

On the other hand, a higher unemployment rate leads the government to lower stringency of movement restrictions. Our findings provide evidence on the tradeoff between unemployment rates and infection cases under the government’s virus containment intervention policies. This allows the policymakers to find a balance between public health emergencies and the economy. We also find that the stringency is affected positively by infection cases, negatively by the number of hospital beds per capita and healthcare spending per capita; the number of infection cases is affected positively by urban population density and negatively by an individualism index; and the unemployment rate is affected negatively by GDP. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19 cases; movement restrictions; simultaneous equations models; stringency index; unemployment rate","COVID-19; disease control; disease spread; disease transmission; economic impact; governance approach; Gross Domestic Product; labor policy; movement; numerical model; policy making; public health; unemployment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115228377

For a more detailed analysis, we propose a multi-level framework, which is validated empirically. For this, we perform a robust regression, since various input variables at the firm-level as well as the residuals of exploratory OLS regressions are found to be heavy-tailed. We conclude that Fabricant’s laws and other regularities are primarily characteristics of the sectoral level which rely on aspects like infrastructure, technology level, innovation capabilities, and the knowledge base of the relevant labor force.

We argue this is because scholarship has not incorporated corporate-level factors that influence how corporate managers structure holistic capital allocation strategies. In this study, we build on the behavioral theory of the firm to focus on analyst performance projections for multidivisional corporations and how they inform corporate managers' allocation strategies. Specifically, we theorize corporate managers deviate from the winner-picking allocation approach owing to search-related behaviors stemming from projected performance below or above expectations.

This paper studies the interaction between peer-induced fairness and personalized pricing in a distribution channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. While consumers are fair-minded, the retailer can apply personalized prices. Using a game-theoretic approach, we find that consumer fairness concern compels the retailer to reduce prices. However, the retailer will reduce the price toward high-valued consumers by a larger amount than the price toward low-valued consumers. This drives the manufacturer to offer a much lower wholesale price. As a result, the retailer using personalized pricing is better off in the presence of consumer fairness concern. This finding still holds when the capability of personalized pricing is endogenous, when social comparison may increase a consumer’s utility, and when the degree of fairness concern depends on the size of population. These effects are unique to peer-induced fairness, while related emotions such as distributional fairness concern cannot improve the retailer’s profit. © Operational Research Society 2021.","behavioural economics; distribution channel; fairness; game theory; Personalized pricing","Game theory; Manufacture; Sales; Distribution channel; Fairness concerns; Game-theoretic; Personalized pricing; Whole sale prices; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111828536

While private firms rely on Government support to achieve timely the necessary green investment intensity, Governments rely on private firms to tackle financial constraints and technology transfer. This interaction is analysed in the real options literature only under risk neutrality, and, consequently, the implications of risk aversion due to the idiosyncratic risk that green technologies entail are overlooked. To analyse how this interaction impacts a firm’s investment policy and a Government’s subsidy design under uncertainty and risk aversion, we develop a real options framework, whereby: (i) we solve the firm’s investment problem assuming an exogenous subsidy; (ii) conditional on the firm’s optimal investment policy, we address the Government’s optimisation objective and derive the optimal subsidy level; (iii) we insert the optimal subsidy level in (i) to derive the firm’s endogenous investment policy. Contrary to existing literature, results indicate that greater risk aversion lowers the amount of installed capacity yet postpones investment. Also, although greater uncertainty raises the optimal subsidy under risk neutrality, the impact of uncertainty is reversed under high levels of risk aversion. © 2021 The Author(s).

Such analysis can be challenging because of the interconnected effect of technical product characteristics, marketing mix elements, and the environment (e.g. competition, consumers). Moreover, employees from different functions have different backgrounds and perceptions about the origins of patterns, which constrains mutual understanding and hampers decision-making. The group model building (GMB) approach can be an effective method to support teams in solving complex dynamic problems, such as a PLC analysis of product sales. This study uses a GMB approach and presents a system dynamics model, which supported cross-functional collaboration in analysing causes of stagnating product sales in the PLC of a healthy snack product in a food processing company. Through multiple GMB sessions with the company team, a system dynamics model was developed, and several strategies were analysed. The model has proven useful in explaining the reasons behind the sales stagnation and in studying possible interventions.

To further our understanding of the behavioural factors that operational researchers working in healthcare consider influence their work’s impact, we interviewed 24 OR practitioners working in academia and with experience of working with the UK National Health Service (NHS). The semi-structured interviews were consented, recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically using a framework approach. Five dominant themes emerged that highlighted: behavioural challenges concerning flexibility, pivoting and the abandonment of projects; the influence of the evolving ambitions, maturity and behaviours of a practitioner’s OR group; the hidden and changing motivations of host healthcare organisations; the reliance of practitioners on intuition and how their praxis is influenced by their agency within their group and its relationships with healthcare organisations; and how attributes of altruism, broader life experience and creative risk-taking influence an individuals’ praxis.

Based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper empirically examines the relationship between IT factors, intermediate performance metrics, and business outcomes. It also advances a new conceptual perspective to investigate the relationship between IT investment and performance. We propose a theoretical framework based on network DEA models, considering multiple periods, multiple inputs and outputs to study and understand the influence of IT on performance. Using a sample of 86 firms from Asia, Europe, and the US, we measure information technology performance with network DEA models, advance an explanation of the relationship between IT and performance and compare this relationship by regions and industries. By integrating DEA and a configurational analysis, we also develop a set of configurations of IT performance to understand the differences by regions and industries. Our results show that: IT performance shows little regional difference, but significant industrial diversity. We found four configurations to capture industrial differences in IT performance, and found that the efficiency of IT operations rather than IT investments, was the main reason leading to an increase in business performance. © Operational Research Society 2021.","configurational approach; Data envelopment analysis; information systems; information technology and performance","Commerce; Investments; Business outcomes; Business performance; IT investments; Multiple inputs and outputs; Network DEA model; Performance metrics; Regional differences; Theoretical framework; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107868689

While conventional models of expert intuition often link intuitive competence to pattern recognition skills, the current paper advances prior knowledge by demonstrating that intuitive expertise is inextricably linked to actors’ ability to discriminate between subtle informational cues through the process of information filtering. Drawing on data from a phenomenological study involving thirty (30) fireground commanders (UK = 15, Nigeria = 15), the study utilised the critical decision method (CDM) to explore the cognitive strategies utilised by these expert fire-fighters. The method entailed that each expert participant shared a retrospective non-routine fire incident that particularly challenged their expertise, allowing the resulting qualitative data to be coded and analysed using a combination of emergent themes analysis (ETA) and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Specifically, the paper develops and discusses: (i) a theoretical model of intuition that emerged directly from the expert incident accounts (ii) an inventory of forty-two critical cues that aided expert decision-making on the fireground, alongside a cue classification framework. Competence on the fireground was found to be a function of experts’ cue discriminatory and information filtering abilities that subsequently allowed information from multiple sources to be processed and utilised efficiently. Although the firefighting domain formed the central focus of this study, findings are deemed generalisable across other high-risk organisations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","critical decision method; firefighters; informational cues; Intuitive expertise; naturalistic decision-making","Decision making; Fire extinguishers; Pattern recognition; Classification framework; Cognitive Strategy; Conventional models; Naturalistic decision makings; Phenomenological analysis; Prior knowledge; Qualitative data; Theoretical modeling; Information filtering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107474400

ISG consists of the processes, organizational structures, and most importantly, the corporate leadership involved in the safeguarding of organization’s information assets. Hence, the purpose of ISG is to bring information security to the attention of the executives such as CEOs and Boards, so that the executives can address the issues of information security and take security-related decisions that lead to outcomes that better align with organizational goals such as value delivery, better performance measurement, business process assurance, and risk management. In order for the corporate leadership to make data-driven decisions, data related to various security metrics are collected and presented in the form of dashboards. The goal of this article is to identify those security metrics that are particularly important from an ISG standpoint. A survey was performed on security literature to identify and categorize ISG metrics. An ISG metrics taxonomy was developed as a result of this study. Security teams can benefit from the ISG metrics taxonomy as, when creating security dashboards, the taxonomy can focus their attention on those specific security metrics that are of most value to the corporate leadership. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cybersecurity; Information security governance; literature review; metrics; taxonomy","Risk assessment; Risk management; Surveys; Taxonomies; Business Process; Data driven decision; Information assets; Information security governance; Organizational goals; Organizational structures; Performance measurements; Security metrics; Security of data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106320747

Warehousing facilities have the greatest potential for reducing socio-environmental impact. Yet, both research and practice have given relatively less attention to considering all aspects of sustainability in warehouses. In order to address this gap, this study proposes combining both input from professionals and from a literature survey of triple-bottom-line theory in order to develop a sustainable warehouse criteria framework, thus contributing to sustainable organisational warehouse evaluation. The method supporting the evaluation of this framework is based on the integration of a multicriteria AHPSort traffic light visualisation technique and novel post-optimal analysis. Furthermore, the authors deployed this framework and integrated methodology in an Indian manufacturing company to evaluate and classify seven of their warehouses for decision making. The traffic light visualisation technique presents and conveys the results better than numbers. Finally, the new post-optimal analysis provides recommendations for cost efficient improvements. The findings of this study present valuable insights and guidelines for industrial managers and practitioners, especially those from the Indian manufacturing industry, for sustainable warehouse decision-making, and for improving their overall corporate sustainability performance. © Operational Research Society 2020.","AHPSort; Decision analysis; multi-criteria; post-optimal analysis; supply chain; sustainability","Decision making; Environmental impact; Manufacture; Supply chains; Visualization; Warehouses; Corporate-sustainability; Industrial managers; Integrated methodology; Literature survey; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing industries; Optimal analysis; Triple Bottom Line; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106242351

We use amateur and expert investors' expectations about financial asset prices to study this question. Three experiments contrast the rational expectations assumption from neoclassical economics (investors forecast according to neoclassical financial theory) against two psychological theories of expectation formation—behaviorally informed expectations (investors understand empirical market anomalies and expect these anomalies to occur) and narrative expectations (investors use narrative thinking to predict future prices). Whereas neoclassical financial theory maintains that past public information cannot be used to predict future prices, participants used company performance information revealed before a base price quotation to project future price trends after that quotation (Experiment 1), contradicting rational expectations. Importantly, these projections were stronger when information concerned predictions about a company's future performance rather than actual data about its past performance, suggesting that people not only rely on financially irrelevant (but narratively relevant) information for making predictions but erroneously impose temporal order on that information. These biased predictions had downstream consequences for asset allocation choices (Experiment 2), and these choices were driven in part by affective reactions to the company performance news (Experiment 3). There were some mild effects of expertise, but overall the effects of narrative appear to be consistent across all levels of expertise studied, including professional financial analysts. We conclude by discussing the prospects for a narrative theory of choice that provide new microfoundational insights about economic behavior. © 2021 The Authors.

An accurate demand forecast is required at several different levels of a supply chain network to support the planning and decision-making process in various departments. In this paper, we investigate the performance of bottom-up, top-down and optimal combination forecasting approaches in a supply chain. We first evaluate their forecast performance by means of a simulation study and an empirical investigation in a multi-echelon distribution network from a major European brewery company. For the latter, the grouped time series forecasting structure is designed to support managers’ decisions in manufacturing, marketing, finance and logistics. Then, we examine the forecast accuracy of combining forecasts of these approaches. Results reveal that forecast combinations produce forecasts that are more accurate and less biased than individual approaches. Moreover, we develop a model to analyse the association between time series characteristics and the effectiveness of each approach. Results provide insights into the interaction among time series characteristics and the performance of these approaches at the bottom level of the hierarchy. Valuable insights are offered to practitioners and the paper closes with final remarks and agenda for further research in this area. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","forecast combination; grouped time series forecasting; hierarchical forecasting; Supply chain forecasting; time series characteristics","Decision making; Supply chain management; Time series; Decision making process; Empirical investigation; Forecast combinations; Forecast performance; Fundamental component; Supply chain network; Time series characteristic; Time series forecasting; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102941119

With increasing concerns of large pollution emissions from coal-fired power plants and world-wide commitment to environmental change, clean and renewable energy has begun to surge. However, while the installation of renewable energy technology such as solar photovoltaic (PV) panels has risen globally, there has been a sharp reduction in the price of solar PV panels, which has created a challenge for manufacturers and retailers due to a rapidly changing market. This unique characteristic of renewable energy technology supply chains creates inefficiencies by incentivizing manufacturers and retailers to maintain stock levels that are too low prior to a price reduction. To address this challenge, this research models a renewable energy technology supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer (who acts as an installer) that faces stochastic consumer demand. Applying inventory models with stochastic demand, this research aims to (1) demonstrate the negative impact of a price reduction on the supply chain by comparing to a model without a price reduction; (2) characterize the renewable energy technology manufacturer’s and retailer’s optimal stock and production policies with and without a compensation fee contract when a price reduction is present; (3) conduct sensitivity analysis by simulating supply chain performance with different parameter settings; and, (4) provide guidance on supply chain contract design to enhance the efficiency of a renewable energy technology supply chain. © 2021 Operational Research Society.","compensation fee contract design; inventory management; price reduction; renewable energy; Supply chain","Coal; Fossil fuel power plants; Manufacture; Photovoltaic cells; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Coal-fired power plant; Electricity generation; Environmental change; Pollution emissions; Renewable energy technologies; Solar photovoltaics; Supply chain contracts; Supply chain performance; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101264074

This study finds that operational challenges exist for these companies because the reciprocity norm is not obeyed by some customers, who immorally damage or displace the bikes; the government, who does not provide subsidies; and investors, who pursue their own agenda; or because there is a lack of coordination between the company’s online and offline operations arising from a lack of technology and expertise. To overcome the operational challenges of bike-sharing platforms, the study identifies two antecedents (i.e. social capital and technology application) that facilitate the operations process of bike-sharing, and in turn affect operational efficiency. Moreover, three types of social exchange (i.e. exchange between the platform and its customers, government and capital organizations) are identified as moderators of the relationship between bike-sharing operations process and operational efficiency. The proposed theoretical model provides an overall framework to assist bike-sharing platform companies to design and operate their business so that they can overcome operational challenges and achieve expected outcomes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bike-sharing; operational challenges; operations process; social exchange","Bicycles; Bike-sharing; Displacers; Offline; Operation process; Operational challenges; Operational efficiencies; Sharing platforms; Social capitals; Social exchange; Social technologies; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101234580

Therefore, the sustainability return of the single firm is a function of the other firms’ sustainability decisions.

We estimate the parameters of the discrete choice model using the social performance ratings from MSCI KLD 400 Social Index as proxy for sustainability decisions and financial information from Wharton Research Data Services’ COMPUSTAT dataset. When strategic interaction is not accounted for, we find that an increase in the number of competitors increases the likelihood of sustainability investments, seemingly shows the spillover effect dominates the competition. When we apply the multi-stage approach, which incorporates competitive interaction, we provide empirical evidence that the effect of competition on the likelihood of entry into the sustainability market dominates the effect of spillover.

As a result, it is often not possible for customers to go through each review before making purchase decisions. One way to address this problem is to build a system for automatically addressing the helpfulness of reviews and present only those reviews that are determined to be helpful by the system to an end user. The vast majority of existing approaches to the task of review helpfulness prediction are based on hand-crafted features, thus making system performance heavily dependent on the quality of these features. In light of this weakness, we propose a new model of review helpfulness prediction using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and TransE wherein hand-crafted features can also be incorporated to improve the output. Specifically, CNN enables us to learn the semantic information from a review and TransE is used to capture the relationship between different entities mentioned in the review. Experiments on the Amazon product review datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art. © 2022 IEEE.","Hybrid system; machine learning; semantics; text mining","Convolutional neural networks; Semantics; End users; Hybrid method; Online reviews; Product review helpfulness; Product reviews; Purchase decision; Semantic information; State of the art; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097401116

Although strategic consensus is considered a major factor for the success of any manufacturing strategy, the topic has been widely neglected in the operations management literature. Moreover, the limited existing literature typically focusses on large firms in developed economies. In response, this study explores strategic consensus in 38 small companies in Brazil. Multiple company visits were combined with surveys and interviews. Responses from all operational managers (55 responses) and 117 operational-level employees (operators) were obtained. Using cluster analysis this study tests 10 research propositions regarding drivers of strategic consensus that where obtained through a systematic literature review. Results suggest that a high degree of formalisation in planning activities supports strategic consensus, that professional and decentralised decision making may be a better alternative for small firms and that the formalisation of communication channels may not be mandatory for strategic consensus, if there is, for example, a close relationship and collaboration between managers and employees. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Manufacturing strategy; operations strategy; production and operations management; SMEs; strategic alignment","Cluster analysis; Decision making; Managers; Manufacture; Decentralised decision makings; Developed economies; Manufacturing strategy; Operational level; Operations management; Research propositions; Small companies; Systematic literature review; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094858979

We draw from the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) that accounts for intrapersonal factors that increase one's understanding of their threat and coping mechanisms and, subsequently, their motivation to protect such investments. We integrate size of investment – the amount of time, effort, and other personal resources that an individual has put into their online account. Based on PMT's framework, we develop a research model that examines the influence of investment size as an information source that initiates and builds threat and coping appraisals. The model is tested with a survey of 263 responses, and the result shows that investment size influences threat and coping appraisals, which in turn increases MFA protection motivation and use. These results highlight the importance of eliciting individuals’ personal investments in order to improve their protective security behaviors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Investment size; Multi-factor authentication; Online account threat; Personal investment; Protection motivation theory; Secure behaviors","Authentication; E-learning; Motivation; Authentication protections; Coping mechanisms; Information sources; Investment size; Multi-factor authentication; Online account threat; Personal investment; Protection motivation theory; Research models; Secure behavior; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139033409

This study examines the key determinants of professionals’ attitude and intentions to use VC apps in the backdrop of this conflicting duality. A conceptual research model is proposed based on theoretical foundations of privacy calculus and extended with conceptualizations of mobile users’ information privacy concerns (MUIPC), trust, technicality, ubiquity, as well as theoretical underpinnings of social presence theory. Structural equation modeling is used to empirically test the model using data collected from 484 professionals. The study offers insights regarding the trade-offs that professionals are willing to make in the face of information privacy concerns associated with VC apps. Based on the findings, the study emphasizes the promotion of privacy protection at the organizational level, control mechanisms that motivate employees to actively engage in privacy protection behavior, and a multi-faceted approach for data transparency within the VC app platforms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Mobile users’ information privacy concerns; Privacy calculus; Social presence; Technicality; Trust; Ubiquity; Video conferencing applications","Calculations; Economic and social effects; Mobile telecommunication systems; Information privacy concerns; Mobile users; Mobile user’ information privacy concern; Privacy calculus; Social presence; Technicality; Trust; Ubiquity; User information; Video conferencing application; Video-conferencing; Video conferencing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138039532

Yet the broader idea of travel-induced shaming, conceptualized as ethics-based evaluations in this paper, has not drawn much attention as consequence-based assessments in travel-related risk research. This paper presents two studies revealing a) how ethics- and consequence-based risk evaluations influence individuals' travel attitudes/intentions and b) how message framing about responsible travel affects travel shame and individuals' intentions to travel responsibly. Using structural equation modeling, Study 1 suggests that consequence- and ethics-based evaluations play key roles in predicting travelers’ attitudes/intentions to travel. Moreover, social trust and self-efficacy significantly affect both types of risk evaluations. Study 2 adopts an experimental design and shows that, compared with loss-framed and controlled message conditions, gain-framed messaging can reduce travel shame and encourage tourists to travel responsibly.

This study develops a two-stage game model for the decision-making of an OEM from an exporting country showing that the optimal remanufacturing model is significantly affected by the tax and tariff regulations of the importing country and more particularly, the difference between sales tax on remanufactured products and the unit product import tariffs on new products. The model selections for the OEM and the importing country align when this difference is close to zero. This paper is one of the few examining the impact of tax and tariff regulations on outsourcing decisions in remanufacturing contexts, which is largely neglected in the extant literature but has become increasingly important, especially with recent development trends of deglobalization (e.g., Brexit, the US–China trade war, and various sanctions). The significance of this study is threefold: the work makes novel theoretical contributions to the decision-making game model with tax and tariff constructs taken into consideration, has practical implementations for optimizing the strategic business deployment of OEMs, and has implications for consideration of policy and social welfare by policy makers of the destination country. © 2022 The Author(s)","Decision analysis; Global supply chain; Outsourcing; Remanufacturing; Tax and tariff","Decision making; Outsourcing; Sales; Supply chains; Decisions makings; Game models; Global supply chain; Original equipment manufacturers; Outsourcing decisions; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing supply chains; Tariff regulation; Tax and tariff; Third parties; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131363797

The determination of super-efficiency has been a way of solving this problem by providing a method to differentiate between the performance of observations. Despite the existence of some approaches dealing with the notion of super-efficiency in the literature, there have been few attempts to address this problem from the standpoint of machine learning techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap by adapting Random Forest to determine super-efficiency in the context of the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) technique. The new super-efficiency approach is robust to resampling on inputs and data. Additionally, we show how the new approach could be a possible solution for dealing with the curse of dimensionality problem; typically associated with FDH. Furthermore, exploiting the adaptation of Random Forest, a new method for assessing the importance of input variables is introduced. Finally, the advantages of the proposed approach are illustrated through a real example. © 2022 The Author(s)","Data envelopment analysis; Free disposal hull; Machine Learning; Super-efficiency","Decision trees; Efficiency; Machine learning; Random forests; Efficiency evaluation; Free disposal hulls; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Measurements of; Performance; Random forests; Resampling; Super-efficiency; Technical efficiency; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132665028

Industry 4.0 readiness models are worthy methods to aid manufacturing organizations in tracking the development of their businesses and operations. Nevertheless, there are different Industry 4.0 readiness models; no work has yet analyzed Industry 4.0 readiness degree and causal effects relationships using fuzzy cognitive maps. This paper proposes an Industry 4.0 readiness model that consists of readiness requirements obtained from the literature and validated through a mixed-method approach, including literature reviews and questionnaires. To validate the proposed Industry 4.0 readiness model, the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis methods are used. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is utilized to assess readiness, identify relevant concepts to improve readiness degree, implement Industry 4.0, and analyze causal relationships among concepts and dimensions. Through this model and the FCM method, managers can recognize relevant concepts and predict complicated cause-effect relationships among concepts in two states of static and dynamic analyses to increase readiness degree. The paper concludes by emphasizing managerial implications for successful applications in practice as well as future research suggestions on developing the Industry 4.0 readiness model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM); Industry 4.0; Readiness model","Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Fuzzy rules; Managers; Multivariant analysis; Surveys; Confirmatory factor analysis; Factor analysis method; Factors analysis; Fuzzy cognitive map; Industrial revolutions; Literature reviews; Manufacturing organizations; MAP approach; Mixed method; Readiness models; Industry 4.0",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139286881

The literature establishes that investors and financial services clients can exhibit cognitive biases. However, it is not evident whether the financial planners understand and detect cognitive biases among the clients and if they at all 'attempt' to address the biases whilst providing financial planning services. Utilizing the attribution theory, our paper contributes by exploring the gap in research related on cognitive biases among financial planners and provides a future research agenda for addressing the gap, through a qualitative investigation. Our study was designed over two stages, wherein we conducted in-depth interviews in both stages. The first stage included in depth interviews with 21 financial planners and a repeat 10 interviewers with select financial planners, with scenarios in the second stage. In total, we conducted 31 interviews to investigate cognitive biases among financial planners and how Artificial Intelligence can assist. Our findings suggest that cognitive biases exist among financial planners while providing services for the people in need, which is a major challenge for them. Our findings further suggest that digital transformation by using the Artificial Intelligence technologies might help overcome this existing biases, albeit, AI technologies ought to be combined with human intelligence. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no existing research on the association between cognitive biases and artificial intelligence among financial planners. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence, Financial planners; Cognitive biases; Decision making",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138114320

This paper characterizes two common constrained policies from the practices of pharmaceutical markets. The first (policy P) controls the ratios of the LPD's purchasing quantity and fee. The second (policy S) controls the ratios of the LPD's selling quantity and revenue. Considering a pharmaceutical supply chain consisting of two independent manufacturers and a hospital, we investigate the impacts of two policies on the LPD's availability and the whole industry gains. Our results show that policy P dominates policy S in two aspects: (a) policy P provides a higher product availability of the LPD and (b) policy P reduces less profits for the pharmaceutical supply chain. Specifically, policy P could incur a win-win outcome for the patient and the supply chain. We further show that the demand allocation of the LPD, the substitution degree, and the profit margins' difference can significantly affect the performances of the policies. © 2020 The Authors.

This resulted in a semiparametric smooth-coefficient (SPSC) production function. The novelty of the SPSC approach is that it can explain the direct and indirect channels through which risk can affect productivity. The study uses several measures of risk, including attitudes toward risk, perceptions of risk, and risk management skills of farmers. It then shows how these risk-related variables affect productivity both directly and indirectly via the inputs. Using 2015 farm-level data from organic basmati rice (OBR) smallholders in India, the study finds that OBR farmers with high degrees of risk aversion had lower productivity than less risk-averse or risk-neutral OBR farmers. Additionally, OBR farmers who were most concerned about production risks (i.e., weather and pest risks) had higher productivity than their counterparts. Finally, the study reveals that OBR farmers can reduce production costs by increasing farm size. © 2022 The Author(s)","OR in agriculture; Organic rice; Production risk; Productivity; Semiparametric model","Agriculture; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Basmati rice; OR in agriculture; Organic rice; Organics; Production function; Production risks; Rice farmers; Risks management; Semi-parametric modeling; Semiparametric; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129805346

Our choice model captures the increasing customer frustration of finding multiple products unavailable as a factor affecting purchasing decisions. To model the highly uncertain order in which a customer explores the products to buy, we present a bi-level optimization approach to maximize the expected revenue assuming that the customer visits a sequence of unavailable products that minimizes the likelihood of staying in the store. We show that the resulting problem is NP-hard and develop exact and greedy solution approaches that can solve different instances efficiently in terms of both solution time and optimality gap. We develop a model extension that includes multiple customer categories and also show a special case of the problem that can be solved in polynomial time.

However, they are likely to accept longer payback period in CSS programs with higher participation rate because of the potential benefit from interpersonal communication.

The aim of this study is to investigate the degree of importance of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) on sustainable mining using a rough sets based decision making approach. This novel approach consists of three consecutive stages, namely a questionnaire (survey), data analyses, and SDGs classification. Firstly, a survey is conducted to receive a response from internationally experts across different countries. Each participant is asked to evaluate the importance of each SDG. Secondly, the analyses are carried out to make a distinction among groups of participants who respond similarly and discover viewpoints from the industry, academia, and non-governmental organizations. Finally, the degree of importance of each SDG for sustainable mining is found using a novel decision making approach including Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) based on rough sets. The survey of the results indicated that for all the participants of the survey, independently of their background, the most important SDG for sustainable mining was “SDG8: Decent work and economic growth”, while the one perceived as the least important was “SDG14: Life below water”. The main objective of SDG8 is to promote economic growth through job opportunities and decent work for all. This in turn leads to a more sustainable, long-term economic growth. While all SDGs play an important role, the proposed rough sets based decision making method provided a rational and objective evaluation performance of their perceived priority in the mining sector. © The Authors","Decision support system; Multi-criteria decision making; Rough sets; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable mining","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Economics; Planning; Rough set theory; Surveys; Sustainable development; Decisions makings; Economic growths; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Priority approach; Rough set; Rough-set based; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable mining; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140140697

This study examines the relevance of climate technologies, financialization (financial market efficiency and financial institutions' access), and sustainable finance in G10 countries. The initial findings confirm a long-run cointegrating relationship between model variables and highlight the issues of cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity. Therefore, we employ the Cross-Sectional Augmented ARDL model and find that climate technologies, financial institutions' access, and green bonds (financial market efficiency) significantly decrease (increase) carbon emissions. Manifestly, the marginal contribution of climate technologies is higher towards emissions reduction, followed by green financing. Similar outcomes are observed in the short run; nevertheless, the coefficient magnitudes are relatively lower. The stability of the model is also confirmed through significant and negative error correction terms, implying a substantial convergence towards steady-state equilibrium in case of any deviation. These results are also validated by alternative estimators and offer valuable policy recommendations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emission; Climate technologies; Financial development; Green finance","Carbon; Climate models; Commerce; Efficiency; Emission control; Environmental technology; Error correction; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Climate technology; Environmental challenges; Financial development; Financial institution; Green finance; Green growths; Longest run; Market efficiency; Model variables; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140139368

This study explores the impact of climate change on SMEs' innovation from a resource-based view (RBV) standpoint. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 443 SMEs from 14 developing countries during the period 2007–2016, we found that climate change has a significant positive impact on SMEs' innovation performance. In economic terms, climate change of one standard deviation variation resulted in a 6.6 % increase in innovation investment. Interesting results emerged when the sample was divided into firms with high and low growth, high and low profit, and high and low slack resources, and industries with high and low vulnerability. The results show that SMEs' innovation response to climate change may vary substantially across firms and industries. In high-growth, high-slack-resources firms, and in highly profitable and non-vulnerable industries, SMEs' innovation responds positively to climate change. Our study contributes to the SME and climate change literature by being the first to examine the impact of climate change on SMEs' innovation.

Extending the existing literature, the proposed model views organizational socialization as a cumulative process that allows the impact of pre-entry variables on accommodation and outcomes. Longitudinal design is used to measure the impact of key socialization factors on newcomers' productivity and commitment by controlling for entry-level perceptions. The virtual setting chosen for this study is the academic units at a premium Business school with multiple campuses in India. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) hierarchical linear regression modeling is used to analyze time-lagged study data of 373 Master of Business Administration (MBA) students. The study reports some unique aspects of newcomers' socialization in a virtual environment, and explains how and why some influential socialization factors might show varying effects if traditional physical settings are missing. Contesting the findings of previous studies, results of this study reveal that in virtual socialization process, pre-entry experience emerges as a strong predictor of accommodation for newcomers.

We propose a new model for evaluating consumers' green purchase intentions (GPI) through social media (SM) by expanding the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with additional variables, namely green thinking, social media usage, and social media marketing. 785 usable responses were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, and PLS-SEM was applied to perform the analysis. Findings suggest that attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, green thinking, and social media marketing have a strong and positive association with the intention to purchase green products on social media. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical research to explore the moderating-mediating impact of social media usage interaction on the proposed TPB model, bridging research gaps by investigating the effect of consumers' green purchase intentions.

In consequence, privacy is now the combined responsibility of first and third parties. We introduce the concept of privacy contract to investigate the effect of first versus third party privacy handling on customer reactions, including privacy contract fulfilment versus privacy contract breach. An online experiment with 296 participants confirmed that differences in privacy contract handling affects continuance intentions. This link is mediated through perceived contract fulfilment and feelings of violation. Although first party actions led to somewhat stronger reactions, both first and third party privacy contract (mis)handling affected continuance intentions and cognitive and affective reactions. Our findings demonstrate that individuals make little distinction between first and third party responsibilities, indicating that privacy contracts extend beyond the original relationship between customer and online retailer. It further demonstrates that privacy contracts offer a strong theoretical framework to understand customer reactions across different privacy situations. Conceptually, our study shifts privacy from a dualistic towards a network perspective of subjectively held privacy obligations, offering important pointers to guide organizations’ privacy management. © 2022 The Author(s)","Continuance intentions; e-commerce; Information privacy; Privacy contract; Psychological contract; Third party","Electronic commerce; Sales; Affective reactions; Continuance intentions; Customer data; Customer privacy; E- commerces; Information privacy; On-line experiments; Privacy contracts; Psychological contracts; Third parties; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139593344

They defined reserves to be “economically producible” based on a lagging measure, “current prices,” which converted a geophysical measure of fossil fuel formations into a price index of oil and gas prices.

However, little is known as to how well the ACC technology has served the off-site manufacturing (OSM) industry from the end users' perspective. This paper aims to measure the New Zealand (NZ) OSM industry's awareness and readiness for ACC and explore a pathway toward wider ACC adoption. It first reports on a survey study in NZ with 44 valid survey responses. It then proposes a high-level roadmap with key actions that can facilitate wider ACC adoption through 16 interviews with international ACC experts and a focus group with nine local OSM stakeholders. The results show that although there is a high demand for automating compliance processes, the OSM industry, especially small and medium enterprises, are not ready to adopt the ACC technology. Suggestions to address this include (1) establish the foundation for broad ACC adoption; (2) boost the development of the ACC technology to expedite its maturity, (3) test the ACC technology under different scenarios and customize it for the NZ context; (4) encourage the government to provide funding and policy support; and (5) promote education and training of both building information modeling (BIM) and ACC to OSM stakeholders. The results can provide software vendors with valuable information about user expectations and requirements to develop ACC products that can better serve NZ OSM projects, and help OSM stakeholders in NZ and countries with similar economic and regulatory structures to understand the technological and nontechnological gaps to better prepare for the ACC technology adoption. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.","Automated compliance checking (ACC); Building information modeling (BIM); Off-site manufacturing (OSM); Technology adoption","Architectural design; Automation; Compliance control; Engineering education; Information theory; Manufacture; Automated compliance checking; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Manufacturing industries; New zealand; Off-site manufacturing; Technology adoption; Twentieth century; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139422732

The volatility of natural resource pricing has become more important since natural resource prices and media economy play a critical role in economic development, which is comparatively understudied. Researchers and scholars see new tendencies in the natural resources price volatility, media economy and productivity growth nexus. Natural resource volatility might negatively influence a country's or region's economic growth and media economy is positively correlated with development of green economic recovery. As a result, the present research tries to determine the link between natural resources, media economy while evaluating the importance of green innovation in European Union economies between 1990 and 2021. CS-ARDL findings showed that natural resource volatility, oil rents, gas rents, media economy (entertainment, advertising, social media, music, games, internet media, theatre and art) and green innovation had a favorable impact on economic efficiency in both the short and long term. According to the long-run estimator enhanced mean group, these findings are well supported (AMG). In addition, the Granger panel causality heterogeneity test conducted by Dumitrescu and Hurlin reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between the variables under consideration and economic growth. As a result of the results, it is suggested that green marketing, price caps, and hedging of natural resources might all be effective ways to enhance financial efficiency and decrease the unpredictability of natural resource prices in the area. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth; Green innovation; Hedging; Media economy; Natural resource; Volatility of price","Commerce; Costs; Economic efficiency; Marketing; Natural resources; Productivity; Social networking (online); Economic development; Economic growths; Economic recovery; Green innovations; Hedging; Medium economy; Resource development; Resource price; Social media; Volatility of price; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139340193

Green total factor productivity (GTFP) is a sine qua non for an environmental-friendly and sustainable economy. Therefore, this study investigates the causal relationship between the High-Speed Rail (HSR) and GTFP in a panel of 277 Chinese prefecture-level cities observed from 2003 to 2016. Using the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, we demonstrate that the HSR opening has significantly increased urban GTFP. Furthermore, we explore the channels of the observed positive relationship between the HSR opening and urban GTFP. Specifically, we shed light on the mediating role of climatic conditions, air pollution, and factor agglomeration in the relationship between the HSR opening and GTFP. The results show that climatic conditions significantly mediate this relationship. HSR opening leads to lower pollution and more favourable climatic conditions. Improved climatic conditions drive talent gathering, investment gathering, and green technology concentration, which translate into higher GTFP. Government policies that create favourable climatic conditions to attract green investments in human and physical capital and stimulate green innovations can translate into higher GTFP. © 2022","Air pollution; China; Climatic conditions; Factor agglomeration; High-speed rail; Urban green Total factor productivity","Air pollution; Climate change; Economics; Productivity; Railroad transportation; China; Climatic conditions; Economy and society; Factor agglomeration; Global challenges; High speed rail; Mediating roles; Policy intervention; Total factor productivity; Urban green total factor productivity; Agglomeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139213775

Since customers would not buy unsatisfactory goods, managers have to decide whether to reuse or recycle them. Proposing a framework in which consumers involve in supply chain managerial decisions leads to customer-centric reverse logistics by introducing a Decentralized consensus decision-making concept. Moreover, an industry benchmark would aid managers and policymakers. Based on Logistics 4.0, this study developed a framework and used social media data to improve reverse logistics decision-making using artificial intelligence - a deep learning hybrid method that combines convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks. Furthermore, this study shows how to use sentiment analysis algorithms to analyze positive and negative feedback from customers and develop high-efficiency decentralized disposition decision-making techniques for reverse logistic managers. Without the need for human intervention, corporations may use the framework to smart scrutinize their customers' feedback and sentiments to make strategic reverse logistics decisions for reducing returned goods, waste, inventory levels, and costs while increasing productivity, benefits, supply chain sustainability, and customer loyalty, resulting in a more effective movement towards green logistics, a competitive advantage, and increased profits for the corporation.

Given the preference to preserve socio-emotional wealth, servitization in family firms presents a double-edged sword. That is to say, a preference to preserve socio-emotional wealth facilitates the development of relationships with service-related stakeholders, but it may also prevent family firms from diluting their socio-emotional wealth through greater service-related collaboration with outsiders. In a sample of 35,329 manufacturing firms (13,755 family firms and 21,574 non-family firms from 2010 to 2018) in Portugal, we find that family firms have lower levels of servitization, and they achieve lower performance through servitization.

We address a lack of research on the factors influencing post-adoption decisions of discontinuance for this important class of innovations. We conducted a repeat survey with UK consumers (n = 995) in 2019 and 2020 to investigate 16 digital products and services across mobility, food, homes, and energy domains. Our survey captured temporal changes in adoption, personal and contextual characteristics, social influences, innovation experiences and perceived attributes. We also provide a unique contribution by assessing the impacts of Covid-19 on post-adoption processes. Our results indicate that discontinuance is associated with: 1) services more than products; 2) perceived functional attributes not met by experienced attributes; 3) a lack of positive social influence, including word-of-mouth; 4) a lack of social network connections to other adopters; and 5) a decline in an individual's financial situation.

Cross-sectional data were collected from 567 mobile money payment users in Ghana to test twelve hypotheses using structural equation modelling (SEM). The study showed a positive and significant relationship between the gamified mobile money payment (Gmmp) and the social impact theory constructs, and consequently with the customer value propositions. The Gmmp was found to have a significantly positive relationship with all three social impact constructs of internalisation, compliance, and identification. However, compliance was significantly predictive of all the customer value constructs (customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty); identification was significantly predictive of satisfaction and loyalty; and internalisation was not significantly predictive of any of the customer value outcomes. The results show that Gmmp could create a substantial social impact on users to generate value for the customer and all service providers within the mobile money ecosystem.

Traditional methods of understanding customer needs rely on costly marketing surveys and have difficulties accurately capturing new customer requirements in a fast-evolving market. Online reviews with positive and negative sentiments are commonly used as effective sources for mining customer requirements. Previous studies related to product design strategies often overlook neutral sentiment when analyzing online reviews for product design improvement. In this study, we propose a customer requirement identification framework that identifies the product attributes reflecting customer needs from online reviews, considering three types of sentiment polarities: positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. We categorize the identified customer needs into five product attribute categories that help form product design strategies using the Kano model. Evaluations using two review datasets for laptops and smartphones show that the consideration of neutral reviews caused the majority of the product attributes to be categorized differently by the proposed method. Furthermore, the product categorization obtained from our method achieved a better agreement with domain experts and consumers than that produced by the baseline Kano model, not considering neutral sentiment. We further established evidence that the product design informed by our product categorization results achieved better customer satisfaction than those generated from the baseline Kano model and the questionnaire-based Kano model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Kano model; Neutral sentiment; Online reviews; Sentiment analysis; Topic modeling","Commerce; Customer satisfaction; Product design; Sales; Surveys; Customer need; Customer requirements; Design strategies; Kano model; Neutral sentiment; Online reviews; Product attributes; Requirement identification; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Sentiment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138386152

An “open price contract” is one in which a buyer commits to purchasing goods from a seller even though the price has not been agreed upon at the time of signing. Open price contracts generally give the seller the right to set prices ex post, and the buyer is then obligated to purchase from the seller at those prices. This gives rise to obvious incentives for short-run opportunistic pricing by the seller, but also disincentives from long-run reputational consequences. In this article, we focus on a specific application where open price contracts are common and test for opportunistic ex-post pricing by sellers on locked-in buyers. We find that sellers’ long-run reputational incentives dominate opportunistic incentives, consistent with lessons from the relational contracts literature. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cost passthrough; Fuel; Gasoline; Incomplete contracts; Lock-in; Locked-in buyers; Open price contracts; Open price terms; Opportunistic pricing; Wholesale","Contracts; Costs; Locks (fasteners); Cost passthrough; Incomplete contracts; Lock-in; Locked-in buyer; Longest run; Open price contract; Open price term; Opportunistic pricing; Short runs; Wholesale; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138160293

As a result, there is an increased propensity to acquire and accumulate substantial amounts of digital content.

These countries were selected because of their high GDPs in Europe (CS-ARDL). All countries' long-term elasticities were estimated. According to the study, using non-renewable and renewable energy leads to economic recovery in these nations. Even though natural resources constrain economic growth in countries, they also drive economic activity in such countries. Economic recovery and non-renewable energy sources increase carbon emissions, but renewable energy lowers emissions.

Customers request the service through a website or by calling a call centre and the company needs to allocate the service tasks to time windows and decide on how to schedule these jobs to their vehicles. We propose a new approach to this problem which applies low-emission vehicle routing techniques with dynamic pricing to reduce CO2 emissions and maximise profit. When a customer requests a service, the company will provide the customer with different service time-window options and their corresponding prices. Prices are differentiated to influence the customer's choice. To help the company in determining the prices, our approach solves the problem in two phases. The first phase solves a time-dependent vehicle routing model with the objective of minimising CO2 emissions for each of the time window options and the second phase solves a dynamic pricing model to determine the service prices for these options to maximise profit. Metaheuristic methods are applied for real-life business applications which enable the solution framework to be applied online where shorter computational time is required. The approach is tested through numerical experiments.

Yet, consumers often decide not to discard the incumbent technology in favor of a new technology. To explain this decision-making process, a rich research stream has investigated subconscious motivations. However, there is little understanding of the role of conscious motivations and, more importantly, their interplay with subconscious motivations in their decisions. Using the value appreciation perspective, we controlled for the predictors of the second version of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and leverage prospect theory to enrich our understanding of users’ continuance intentions. We conceptualize status quo preference with two new constructs—namely, the value of status quo and users’ commitment to status quo—and integrate them with other known predictors of continuance intentions (related to an incumbent system)—i.e., trust and habit. We empirically test our model in two studies. Study 1 was conducted among 2,096 users of smartphones in Hong Kong. Study 2 reports longitudinal data, across three waves of data collection over a period of six months, from 240 analysts introduced to a new technology to support their work in a large financial services organization. The findings support our model and suggest that (1) users’ status quo preferences significantly determine continuance intentions; and (2) trust and habit have an effect on users’ status quo preferences.

We identify and discuss: a) four distinct governance structures for enabling more coherent global decision making (federation, confederation, network, constituency backbone); b) various mechanisms of formal and informal authority employed by headquarters in order to integrate the diverse interests and actions of their units; and, c) decision rights allocated to units or members to secure commitment to global goals.

We hope this research will not only help to advance scholarship on governance in complex global organizations, but will also be useful to the leadership and boards of international organizations in strengthening the collective voice of their diverse constituencies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Advocacy; Authority; Boards; Governance; Integration; Non-governmental organizations","advocacy; decision making; governance approach; international organization; leadership; nongovernmental organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135950724

Although current anti-phishing tools achieve high accuracy rates and present a potential solution to this problem, users are often reluctant to rely on the predictions of these competent tools. However, we continue to lack a means of resolving this reluctance—or even an explanation for it. To address this need and advance toward a solution, we investigate the factors that influence users' reliance on anti-phishing tools. Over the course of two studies, we test the effects of tool attributes (i.e., accuracy and frequency of phishing email predictions) and develop a model based on the notions of trust and distrust. Countering the common conjecture that tools are not accurate enough, we find that users' under-reliance is not an artifact of the insufficient accuracy of tools, as even in a 100% accuracy condition, users were under-reliant on tools. Rather, we find that while accuracy increases users' trust in tools, full reliance is inhibited by users' distrust, which is driven by a lack of transparency regarding tools' functionalities and the quantity of predictions provided. Thus, overall, our study shows the limits of accuracy in engendering reliance and explains the under-reliance phenomenon by showing that due to lack of knowledge or understanding, some users prefer to rely on their own inferior judgment instead of trusting and relying on the predictions provided by highly accurate tools. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Accuracy; Anti-phishing tool; Distrust; Phishing; Reliance; Trust; Under-reliance","Computer crime; 'current; Accuracy; Anti-phishing tools; Distrust; High-accuracy; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Reliance; Trust; Under-reliance; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135842165

Research examining the competitive advantages that firms accrue from investment in R&D has provided evidence that such efforts can be associated with the voluntary disclosure of research findings in scientific publications. This form of scientific openness occurs despite potentially undermining the value-capturing process by generating knowledge spillovers and hindering the use of other instruments for protecting intellectual property (patents and secrecy). Our understanding of what leads firms to engage in scientific publishing remains relatively limited, however. We address this gap by presenting a systematic review of 164 studies examining firm publishing. We then develop a conceptual framework that outlines five incentives for firms to engage in publishing: (i) accessing external knowledge and resources; (ii) attracting and retaining researchers; (iii) supporting IP strategies; (iv) building the firm's reputation; and (v) supporting commercialization strategies. Mechanisms that relate incentives to publish to firms' major stakeholders – i.e. academia, industry, investors, users, and institutions – are also outlined in the framework. We conclude by setting out an agenda for future research. © 2022 The Authors","Basic research; Firms; Incentives; Knowledge disclosure; R&D investment; Scientific publications; Systematic review","Investments; Reviews; Basic research; Conceptual frameworks; Firm; Incentive; Knowledge disclosure; R&D investment; Scientific papers; Scientific publications; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135722331

The growing trend towards integrating responsible environmentalism into the supply chain has required many organizations to pivot to adopting green supply chain practices. In this paper, we assert that the external environment exercises institutional pressure on organizations to adopting a market orientation, aided by managerial commitment, that espouses green supply chain practices as a strategic resource. A survey of 196 manufacturing managers, largely from the United States, United Kingdom, and India, found that institutional pressure had a significant impact on marketing orientation and market orientation had a significant impact on green supply chain practices. Managerial commitment played a key role in strengthening the relationship between market orientation and green supply chain practices. Lastly, the survey found no difference among United States, United Kingdom, and India manufacturers. We postulate that this no difference could be attributable to the tightly coupled systems found within manufacturing. © 2022 The Authors","Commitment; Green supply chain practices; Institutional pressure; Management; Market orientation; Organizational performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135467065

While some of these studies have found that the effectiveness tends to vary across channels, at a conceptual level, there is no clear understanding of why such consumer differences exist. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a conceptual understanding of how different online marketing channels work so that they can be deployed effectively. To address this need, we present a conceptual model rooted in prior research in online visit type and competition for attention. Specifically, we examine whether the influence of the type of visit (customer-initiated or firm-initiated) engendered by the marketing channel is moderated by the competition for the consumer's attention inherent in the channel. The model helps us understand why and how different online channels influence consumers' search and purchase behaviors in different ways. We test our research hypotheses based on this model by conducting an empirical study on data obtained from a major financial services firm and also on data from an online computer retailer. The results from the empirical analysis provide support for our central thesis that competition for attention moderates the influence of the type of visit on online shopping behavior, and help us make important theoretical contributions and identify interesting managerial implications © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Competition for attention; Conceptual model; Customer-initiated channel; Firm-initiated channel; Goal activation; Online shopping","Activation analysis; Electronic commerce; Sales; Competition for attentions; Conceptual model; Customer-initiated channel; Empirical analysis; Firm-initiated channel; Goal activation; Marketing channels; Modeling analyzes; Online marketing; Online shopping; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135408387

The current study aims to propose a conceptual framework to reduce the impact of adoption barriers against BLC-IoT in FSC. Thirteen key barriers were identified after a thorough literature review and consultation with experts. The relationship among barriers was established using Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methods. The analysis shows that the lack of government regulation and workers' low competency significantly influence BLC-IoT adoption. The results also indicate the intricacy of decision-making by demonstrating that 9 of the 13 barriers were a part of the linkage cluster.

The estimated banks’ minimum distance directional slack inefficiency measure is further decomposed into labor, physical capital, loan, investment and strategic (decision) inefficiency. Empirical findings indicate substantial inefficiencies in Japanese banking that are mainly attributed to the hard-to-achieve targets set by the standard directional slack inefficiency model which is based on Koopmans’ notion of strong efficiency.

Beyond innovation and deployment, other objectives, such as domestic job and industry creation, are usually part of these policy mixes. However, little is known about how policy mixes should be designed and interactions between policy instruments considered when governments try to achieve multiple objectives simultaneously. We address these questions using an agent-based model of the sociotechnical system for solar photovoltaics in Germany that simulates technology adoption, industry dynamics, international spillovers and trade. By changing public spending on research and development and the solar feed-in tariff, forty-five variations of the historical policy mix in Germany are systematically evaluated. The results show that a narrow focus on innovation and deployment outcomes by academic researchers can lead to recommendations for the design of policy mixes that compromise key dimensions of sociotechnical change, such as job creation. Moreover, the simulations reveal that, because of path-dependent interactions between policy instruments, minor changes in the design of policy instruments can lead to vastly different policy outcomes. These findings have important implications for the literature on policy mixes, technology-push and demand-pull instruments, and sociotechnical transitions. © 2022 The Authors","Agent-based modeling; Demand-pull; Innovation; Policy mix; Solar photovoltaics; Technology-push","Autonomous agents; Economics; Simulation platform; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Agent-based model; Demand-pull; Deployment models; Innovation; Innovation models; Policy instruments; Policy mix; Socio-technical changes; Solar photovoltaics; Technology pushes; Computational methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132318806

Experts often attribute such successes to intuition and report that they avoid analysis. Similarly, laypeople can effortlessly perform tasks that confuse machine algorithms. OR should ideally respect human intuition while supporting and improving it with analytical modelling. We utilize research on intuitive decision making from psychology to build a model of mixing intuition and analysis over a set of interrelated tasks, where the choice of intuition or analysis in one task affects the choice in other tasks. In this model, people may use any analytical method, such as multi-attribute utility, or a single-cue heuristic, such as availability or recognition. The article makes two contributions. First, we study the model and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality of using a positive proportion of intuition (i.e., for some tasks): Intuition is more frequently accurate than analysis to a larger extent than analysis is more frequently accurate than guessing. Second, we apply the model to synthetic data and also natural data from a forecasting competition for a Wimbledon tennis tournament and a King's Fund study on how patients choose a London hospital: The optimal proportion of intuition is estimated to range from 25% to 53%. The accuracy benefit of using the optimal mix over analysis alone is estimated between 3% and 27%.

Accelerated digital disruption and abusive trading behaviors, such as the GameStop mania, prompt regulatory changes. It is unclear how this “democratization” of trading power affects market fairness as economies cope with pandemic-driven shifts in basic systems. Excessive speculation and market manipulation undermine the quality of financial markets in the sense that they cause volatility and increase the pain of bubble and crash events. Thereby, they weaken public confidence in financial markets to fulfill their roles in proper capital allocation to irrigate the real economy and generate value for society. While previous studies have mostly focused on market efficiency, our study proposes a tool to improve market fairness, even under periods of stress. To encourage value generation and improve market quality, we advance a graduated Non-Value-Added Tax that we implement in an agent-based model that can realistically capture the properties of real-world financial markets. A profitable transaction is taxed at a higher rate if it does not enhance the efficiency measured by deviation from fundamentals. When an agent locks in profit not supported by fundamentals but driven by trend-following strategies, the generated profit is taxed at various rates under the Non-Value-Added Tax regime. Unlike existing financial transaction taxes, the non-value-added tax is levied on profit rather than on price or volume.

Such ventures, however, typically have long development times with high risk and high capital demand, and consequently have difficulties securing sufficient capital to bridge the “valley of death” between basic research and commercialization. Extant research has explored a great variety of success factors for cleantech ventures, but have not provided sufficient resolution on levers for action that can positively influence the investor perceived risk return ratio when considering investments in early-stage, radical cleantech ventures. With a mixed-methods approach, we analyze investment decisions from 45 of the most prominent, early-stage cleantech investors and venture-investing experts in the EU and the USA. Using ex-post analysis of past investment decisions, we analyzed factors that have previously influenced investor decision making, which we then used to extract 27 levers that can either derisk or increase the return of investments in radical, cleantech ventures. We further validated these 27 levers by presenting them to investors, linked to an ex-ante, standardized investment scenario. This allowed us to gather the first data on the relative effectiveness of these levers. The article's contribution to theory is the development of a multi-actor confluence framework – the “who, what, and how” of influencing investor perceived risk-return ratio for early-stage, radical cleantech investments. The main contribution to practice is a “hands-on overview” for implementing these levers to accelerate capital deployment for cleantech innovation. © 2022","Cleantech; Investor behavior; Risk-return ratio; Sustainable entrepreneurship; Venture capital","Investments; CleanTech; High potential; Investment decisions; Investor behavior; Perceived risk; Production and consumption; Return ratio; Risk-return ratio; Sustainable entrepreneurship; Venture Capital; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139843438

We use corporate social responsibility strategy and policy implementation theories to analyse the processes and conditions for ZDC implementation. We base our study on 35 semi-structured interviews with company representatives and sector actors, publicly available ZDC data, and company reports. The objective is to understand the opportunities and challenges of ZDC implementation at the level of companies. While past research addressed ZDC coverage and effectiveness, knowledge is still lacking on companies' perspectives on the implementation of their commitments. This study provides a unique perspective by integrating the direct experience and knowledge of private actors on an environmental governance regime. We find that companies see implementation of ZDCs as a journey and often rely on voluntary sustainability standards, aligning their strategies and key performance indicators (KPIs) to these. They engage directly in the supply chain, conducting projects “on-the-ground.” Implementing ZDCs requires the involvement of procurement departments and upper management, and collaborations within and between companies. Companies rely on service providers for in-depth knowledge and field implementation. They use monitoring tools, e.g. remote sensing, and see supply chain traceability as a prerequisite for implementation. Companies face numerous implementation challenges. Internally, companies often lack leadership on their ZDC, struggle to align commitments with the organization's operations and to manage suppliers, especially smallholders, and allocate insufficient resources. Externally, they lack common standards and stakeholder support, and face challenging regulatory conditions and missing market incentives. An uneven playing field creates leakage markets. Companies identify better leadership, technology and pre-competitive collaboration as potential solutions. Zero-deforestation commitments are unlikely to greatly contribute to reducing deforestation until better implementation processes, mechanisms, and conditions are in place. © 2022 The Authors",,"Benchmarking; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Remote sensing; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Condition; Corporate social responsibility; Direct experience; Environmental governances; Key performance indicators; Policy implementations; Semi structured interviews; Service provider; Strategy implementations; Upper management; Deforestation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138476376

Our approach enables one to study the equilibrium solution of the entire supply chain network with multiple suppliers and manufacturers. The market and policy-based uncertainties in emission permit price and customer demand are considered, while the supply chain firms can purchase or sell the credit for emission on a carbon emission trading market. We propose a stochastic two-stage model in which the technological capacity investment should be determined in the first stage of the game considering both permit price and demand uncertainties. Once the uncertainties are clear in the second stage, supply chain firms will decide upon their quantity and price to their customers. Proposed analytical and numerical results elucidate the uncertainty value of carbon permit price from novel real option perspectives. The result reveals that the uncertainty of carbon price might have a two-sided impact, both as a risk factor and a potential opportunity for investing in green technologies. The numerical case study shows results corresponding to a paradox, resulting in a balance between cooperation and competition between supply chain parties. We further show why the supply chain members should act strategically to get in a suboptimal choice for all parties involved in the network. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity portfolio; Demand uncertainty; Emission permit price uncertainty; Stochastic two-stage model; Supply chain management","Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Investments; Sales; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Capacity portfolio; Demand uncertainty; Emission permit price uncertainty; Emission permits; Price uncertainty; Stochastic two-stage model; Stochastics; Strategic decisions; Two stage model; Uncertainty; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138062389

While this appears to be a positive event for the country, it is unclear whether and how local communities benefit in the long-term from unconventional gas development. This paper evaluates the impact of oil and gas development on occupation-specific job growth in resource-intensive economies using a unique dataset with annual county employment at the 2- and 5-digit 2010 Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) code combined with education, experience, and training requirements from the O*NET database. Using a first-difference methodology, we find that oil and gas booms have a significant positive impact on occupational job growth in derrick, rotary drill, and service unit operators, truck drivers, secretaries, and engineers, with human capital requirements ranging from less than a high school diploma to at least a bachelor's degree. While occupations associated with oil and gas development and their human capital requirements vary, the results suggest that many of these occupations require workers to have vocational and technical training in addition to a high school diploma, thereby indicating greater demand for workers with intermediate skills in affected areas. Changes in human capital composition resulting from oil and gas development could have significant impacts on a region's ability to respond to energy busts and affect its economic resilience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Energy boom; Human capital; Labor demand; Occupation; Skills","Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Gases; Occupational risks; Truck drivers; Trucks; Capital requirements; Energy; Energy boom; Gas development; Higher School; Human capitals; Labor demands; Occupation; Oil and gas; Skill; Employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139595011

A potential reason is that age and gender are exogenous variables, which do not change by other variables. There must exist endogenous variables, such as the built environment and personal factors, such as affordability, travel needs, exposure to AV knowledge, acting as mediating factors that bridge the exogenous variables and AV acceptance. However, these mediating effects have not been discovered, validated, and quantified. Therefore, this paper provides a new viewpoint in unveiling how ages and genders influence acceptance of AV by quantitatively revealing hidden mediating effects focusing on the built environment and personal factors. A statewide survey was conducted in Kentucky. Besides demographical information, respondents’ personal information such as travel needs, affordability, exposure to AV knowledge, and the built environment were collected. Results reveal that males with high levels of travel needs and affordability better accept AV due to higher familiarity and more experience riding AV. Younger adults are more likely to have higher AV acceptance levels than older adults because younger adults tend to live in an urban setting with higher exposure levels to AV technology. Results suggest that experience in riding an AV, the most influential factor, improves acceptance by 44.8%. The research informs transportation agencies of a better understanding of how people of different ages and genders accept AV. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Acceptance; Automated vehicles; Demographical factors; Mechanisms; Mediating effects; Structural equation modeling","Automation; Vehicles; Acceptance; Automated vehicles; Built environment; Demographical factor; Exogenous variables; Kentucky; Mediating effect; Structural equation models; Vehicle acceptance; Young adults; Population statistics; age structure; automation; demography; gender relations; numerical model; quantitative analysis; transport vehicle; Kentucky; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139298119

As a significant driver of digitalization, technological development has been found to have great potential as a mitigator of a wide range of issues that cities face. To ensure the available technologies are being correctly used, municipalities need to measure their degree of digitalization. This assessment is also important to improve city officials’ understanding of areas that need interventions so that cities can be managed better and provide their residents with a better quality of life. This study applies the baseline principles of the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to develop a decision-support system that facilitates urban digitalization evaluations. The results rely on insights provided by a panel of experts in this area, who used cognitive mapping and the best worst method (BWM) to identify important evaluation criteria within urban digitalization and to analyze their cause-and-effect relationships. The final outcomes were validated by the panel members and representatives of the Associação Nacional de Municípios Portugueses (i.e., National Association of Portuguese Municipalities) and the Agência National de Inovação (i.e., National Innovation Agency). These specialists confirmed that the evaluation system developed facilitates city differentiation in key areas of urban digitalization. The advantages and limitations of the proposed procedures are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Best worst method (BWM); Cognitive mapping; Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Smart city; Urban digitalization","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Mapping; Population statistics; Smart city; BAD methods; Best bad method; City management; Cognitive mapping; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Multiple-criteria decision analyse; Rapid population growth; Technological development; Urban digitalization; Well being; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139075362

A core output derived from demand models is the Value of Travel Time (VTT), which provides insights on the trade-offs that travellers are willing to make in terms of travel time and travel cost. VTT estimates are a critical input to cost-benefit analyses and feasibility assessments of potential projects and thus play a crucial role in transport planning and policy decisions. While much of the early work on VTT made use of revealed preference (RP) data, their use decreased due to growing concerns about reporting errors that may result in omitted observations and measurement errors in the model inputs. As a consequence, VTT measures have, for the last two decades, primarily been estimated using state-preference (SP) surveys. While SP methods can assess the individual trade-offs in a controlled manner, they are prone to behavioural incongruence. More recently, RP data from passively-collected data sources have raised the promise of accounting for some of the limitations of traditional RP surveys due to the minimal (or even no) active input from the respondent. The present study utilises such a dataset that combined a 2-week trip diary captured through smartphone GPS tracking with a household survey containing individual socio-demographic information. A mixed Logit model for mode choice was specified and the estimated parameters were then applied on the National Travel Survey to calculate the VTT estimates. Those estimates were further adjusted based on trip distances to get more representative national VTT values. This process resulted in estimates similar to the official UK guidelines used in transport appraisal that were obtained from SP data, where our results are not affected by concerns about response quality or survey artefacts. The findings hence strengthen the case for shifting towards passively generated RP data sources and are important for transport practitioners. © 2022 The Authors","Emerging data sources; GPS; Mixed Logit models; Transport appraisal; Values of travel time estimates","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Surveys; Data-source; Emerging data source; Mixed logit models; Policy making; Revealed preference datum; Trade off; Transport appraisals; Transport demand modeling; Travel-time; Value of travel time estimate; Travel time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138800292

Supply-side TC mitigation measures increase transportation capacities while demand-side measures attempt to modify travel behavior so that the travel demand is reduced. As part of the demand-side, some corporations are investing in TC reduction through actions that contribute to improved walkability, reduced peak travel demand, and active commuting. While beneficial for their local communities, TC reduction efforts are not specifically tagged as a part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) endeavors. CSR involves reporting of a company's stewardship towards its community and environmental impact. Research reflecting on the impact of CSR on TC has not been conducted. This study aims to fill this gap. Using corporations headquartered in the top traffic-congested cities in the United States, this study examines the relationship between TC and CSR. This research employed a hierarchical linear model with two datasets, Travel Time Index (TTI) and CSRHub ratings. Of the four CSR categories studied, community, employees, and environment ratings are significantly related to TTI, with employees and environment ratings having an inverse relationship to TTI. This shows that congestion has a strong impact on the environment and that companies, through their employee policies, can impact TC. The results also highlight the opportunities that companies have in potentially reducing their environmental impact by incorporating congestion reduction strategies as part of their CSR, either as a separate measure or as part of their environmental or employee CSR ratings. Our results are also a starting point for new tools/strategies that transportation policymakers and analysts can use to engage companies to help mitigate TC. A further study on other cities with major traffic problems may shed more light on CSR and TC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Hierarchical linear model; Quantitative research; Traffic congestion","Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Inverse problems; Personnel; Travel time; Business operation; Congestion reduction; Corporate social responsibility; Demand-side; Hierarchical linear models; Impact on the environment; Quantitative research; Time index; Travel demand; Travel-time; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138761665

Solow hinted at the computer age and productivity statistics puzzle. While this puzzle persisted for many years, a growing literature has picked it up to examine the effect of ICTs on technical efficiency. However, this literature has focused mainly on quantity-based ICTs measures, which have come under severe criticism in recent times. We advance this literature in this paper by shifting the focus of analysis to quality-based ICTs measures; in this case, Internet quality. We also extend the literature by examining how the envisaged relationship between ICTs quality and technical efficiency is conditioned by a country's unique attributes. Our results show a significantly positive effect of ICTs quality on technical efficiency. We also find that the technical efficiency gains associated with ICTs quality are higher in skill-abundant countries, countries that engage more intensively in cross-border trade, have stronger contracting institutions, and are endowed with well-functioning and well-developed financial markets that ensure greater efficiency of capital allocation. We find a network effect in the nexus between ICTs quality and technical efficiency. That is, the marginal effect of ICTs quality on technical efficiency increases as the number of Internet users expands. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. © 2022","ICTs quality; Internet speed; Network effects; Technical efficiency","Commerce; Efficiency; HIgh speed networks; Public policy; Cross-border trades; Efficiency gain; Efficiency of capital allocation; Empirical analysis; ICT quality; Marginal effects; Network effects; Roberts; Technical efficiency; [internet speed; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138442956

They are deemed as an important predictor of economic growth, poverty alleviation, and solving social and economic issues. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many developed and developing economies accounted for a negative change in unemployment, health, education, and other social issues. Consequently, researchers realized that social enterprises are an important predictor to overcome many issues during the pandemic. Hence, the current study contributes to the body of knowledge by investigating the influence of social entrepreneurial orientation on social and economic performance through a mediating role of competitive advantage. The data were collected from the top management of family-owned manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan. The current study executed a dual-stage analysis involving Smart-PLS and artificial intelligence (AI) named Artificial Neurons Networks (ANN). The SEM model shows that social entrepreneurial orientation has a negative impact on economic performance (profit maximization) but a positive effect on social performance. ANN architecture explains the 78 % accuracy of the proposed model. Considering the results, we recommend firms emphasize social entrepreneurial orientation to configure their competitive advantage and performance in the pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Neurons Networks (ANN) Pakistan; Differentiation and cost leadership strategies; SEM; Social and financial performance; Social entrepreneurship","Competition; COVID-19; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Neural networks; Artificial neuron network pakistan; Artificial neuron networks; Differentiation and cost leadership strategy; Economic performance; Entrepreneurial orientation; Financial performance; Pakistan; Social enterprise; Social entrepreneurship; Social performance; Costs; artificial neural network; concentration (composition); cost analysis; economic development; manufacturing; small and medium-sized enterprise; strategic approach; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138140222

Accordingly, understanding and adequately meeting citizens' needs and desires is a fundamental step toward improving citizens' happiness. While prior studies have investigated the direct relationship between technology readiness and continuous intention to use the services, extant results are still fragmented. Hence, this study examines the relationship between citizens' readiness and intention to continue usage by introducing satisfaction and discomfort as mediators in a smart city services (SCS) context. We rely on a mixed-method approach to propose and validate a new readiness model for assessing smart city citizens' readiness for continuous usage and long-term adoption of SCS. In the first phase, qualitative research was used by conducting in-depth interviews with SCS experts to investigate and theorize the main factors perceived as enablers and inhibitors to the continuous usage of SCS. While in the second quantitative phase, data were collected from 350 citizens and structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings suggest three main enablers (empowerment, optimism, and innovativeness) and three main inhibitors (insecurity, mistrust, and legal considerations) that affect the intention to continuously use SCS. In the quantitative phase, satisfaction and discomfort emerged as mediators to intention of continuous usage. Moreover, we found that empowerment, innovativeness, and optimism enhance the continuous usage of SCS when mediated by satisfaction but have no significant effect when mediated by discomfort. Discomfort was found to be an effective mediator between inhibitors and continued usage intention. Our study highlights the role of technology readiness as a personality trait in shaping user satisfaction, discomfort, and intention to continue using SCS. Furthermore, it proposes a new scale and model for measuring users’ readiness to adopt and continuously use SCS. The proposed model has practical implications for SCS providers, and can inform the design of future SCS and ensure their sustainable and successful adoption by citizens, not only initially, but also in the long-term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Citizens' satisfaction; Continuous usage; Discomfort; Post-adoption; Readiness assessment; Smart city services","Economics; Citizen' satisfaction; Continuous usage; Discomfort; Innovativeness; Mediating effect; Post adoptions; Quality of life; Readiness assessment; Smart city service; Technology readiness; Smart city; economic growth; quality of life; smart city; sustainable development; technology adoption; urban economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138119768

Theoretically, we use an information processing view to incorporate digital transformation into tax research. Empirically, we use the fixed effects model to verify our hypotheses based on the fine-grained panel data of Chinese publicly listed enterprises from 2007 to 2019. Results show that (a) digital transformation significantly reduces tax stickiness, (b) digital transformation alleviates tax stickiness by enhancing tax avoidance, and (c) the alleviating effect of digital transformation on tax stickiness is more prominent in companies with weak internal control and regions with low tax enforcement and high environmental uncertainty. Our findings hold after a range of robustness tests. Our results confirm the importance of digital transformation for tax management and provide new insights for enterprises to reduce tax stickiness through digital transformation.

The adoption of a systemic innovation such as BIM within a complex socio-technical environment such as the construction sector requires a thorough understanding of its adoption dynamics at the micro-level and their interactions with the macro level. Studies addressing this theme are lacking which is a significant gap given the growing evidence of decoupling issues between the two levels and the need to support macro level initiatives with both theoretical foundation and empirical evidence. This research proposes a novel analytical investigation of micro BIM adoption and proposes an approach to link micro BIM adoption dynamics to the institutional initiative at the macro level. To analyse the dynamics of micro BIM adoption, the adoption of BIM by 177 organisations was studied. Two methods are used; the fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL), and systems thinking.

Through a combination of cryptographic techniques, a distributed, shared, and immutable ledger, consensus validation of transactions, and a financial audit trail, blockchain is poised to do for businesses what the Internet did for communication. With its promise of reducing cost, time, friction, and fraud in business transactions and ensuring trust, identity management, and reputation management, companies around the world are now contemplating their transition to blockchain versions of themselves. However, the cost of implementing such technology and its effect on the readiness of the organization to adopt blockchain has not been fully explored yet. This study examines the mediation and moderation roles of the perceived cost on the relationship between organization readiness and the intention to adopt blockchain. Data was collected from blockchain experts and Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as the analytical tool to test all of the framework hypotheses. To investigate the potential managerial implications of this topic, Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) was utilized. The findings reveal that perceived cost is not a mediator; rather, it moderates the relationship between the TRI (Technology Readiness Index) enablers and the TRI inhibitors with the intention to adopt blockchain. In terms of importance, the empirical data analysis through IPMA revealed that the enablers construct is the most important factor, while perceived cost has the highest performance on the intention to adopt blockchain. With this discovery, our findings are expected to aid decision-makers in prioritizing and improving the enabling aspects required for the successful adoption of blockchain technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Intention to adopt; Perceived cost; PLS-SME; Technology readiness","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Distributed ledger; Least squares approximations; Block-chain; Cryptographic techniques; Disruptive technology; Intention to adopt; Map analysis; Organizational readiness; Perceived costs; Performance maps; PLS-SME; Technology readiness; Blockchain; computer simulation; cost analysis; Internet; organizational framework; technological change; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137632902

In this paper, the new Critical Duration Index (CDI) is proposed. This index indirectly allows anticipation for the probability of a project ending late, as well as the average project duration extension compared with a deterministic project duration estimate. The accuracy of two simple regression expressions that use the CDI was tested on two representative data sets of 4,100 artificial and 108 empirical (real) projects. Results show that these regression expressions outperformed the only alternative index found in the literature. Besides allowing enhanced forecasting possibilities, calculating the CDI only requires basic scheduling information that is available at the planning stage. It can thus be easily adopted by project managers to improve their project duration estimates over prior deterministic techniques. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Delays; Forecasting; Project; Regression; Scheduling","Apartment houses; Regression analysis; Critical duration; Delay; Deterministics; Project; Project delays; Project duration; Regression; Regression expressions; Scheduling; Scheduling techniques; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137539275

We build up models to examine the effects of the offline store construction integrated with privacy information protection on profits of companies. Moreover, we construct several models with the total utility of the enterprise to further evaluate the effect of CSR, which composes of the net profit and the CSR utility under different CSR consideration. The CSR is taken by no entities, only entity with offline channel, only entity with online channel and both entities, respectively. The results show the competing companies could gain the most earnings in the situation that both channels consider CSR, while only the offline channel considers CSR is the worst choice. In addition, the revenue-sharing contract and cost-sharing contract could optimize the profit of enterprise constructing privacy information protection, and the former is better than the latter.

A machine learning model that is able to predict the trajectories of ground objects can help to diminish the occurrences of such collision events. In this paper, we pursue this objective by building a spatial–temporal graph convolutional neural network (STG-CNN) model to predict the movement of objects/vehicles on the airport surface. The methodology adopted in this paper consists of three steps: (1) Raw data processing: leverage Apache Spark to parse a large volume of raw data in Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) format streamed from the Surface Movement Event Service (SMES) for the purpose of deriving historical trajectory associated with each object on the ground; (2.1) Graph-based representations of ground object movements: build graph-based representations to characterize the movements of ground objects over time, where graph edges are used capture the spatial relationships of ground objects with each other explicitly; (2.2) Trajectory forecasts of all ground objects: combine STG-CNN with Time-Extrapolator Convolution Neural Network (TXP-CNN) to forecast the future trajectories of all the ground objects as a whole; and (3) Separation distance-based safety assessment: define a probabilistic separation distance-based metric to assess the safety of airport surface movements. The performance of the developed model for trajectory prediction of ground objects is validated at two airports with varying scales: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and LaGuardia airport, under two different scenarios (peak hour and off-peak hour). Two quantitative performance metrics–Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) are used to compare the prediction performance of the proposed model with an alternative method. The computational results indicate that the developed method has an ADE within the range 7.55,9.33, and it significantly outperforms an alternative approach that combines a STG-CNN with Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network with an ADE of [15.79,16.89] in airport surface movement prediction, thus facilitating more accurate safety assessment during airport surface operations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation safety; Deep learning; Graph neural network; Safety assessment; Trajectory prediction","Air transportation; Aircraft accidents; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Trajectories; Aviation safety; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Displacement errors; Graph neural networks; Ground objects; Safety assessments; Spatial temporals; Temporal graphs; Trajectory prediction; Graph neural networks; airport; artificial neural network; machine learning; prediction; safety; spatiotemporal analysis; trajectory; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137170648

This paper analyzes the impact of MIT on innovation service performance in manufacturing firms and builds a model structuring the mechanisms of this information technology. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a theoretical model and derives a set of hypotheses based on the dynamic capability theory and innovation diffusion theory. Data used in this paper is collected via surveying 462 manufacturing firms in China using valid questionnaires. Statistical analysis, such as the AMOS method, is then carried out using the data collected to investigate and identify influencing factors upon which to build the model and test the hypotheses. Findings: This paper presents findings that indicate MIT having a direct impact on a firm's service innovation capabilities (SIC) and service innovation performance (SIP). In particular, SIC continuously drives the growth of SIP in a firm, and hence acts as a mediating factor. Moreover, results indicate that both SIC and SIP varies with the strength of innovation network in each firm, while the moderated mediating effect of SIC remains constant. In other words, the performance of service innovation was not to be impacted by certain basic conditions of firms. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to investigate the relationship between the manufacturing industry and advanced technology adoption of enterprise innovation networks and service innovation capabilities. Results are application for adaptation in firms within the manufacturing industry regarding adoption of such advanced technology, such as MIT, and are supportive of these firms constructing enterprise innovation networks and investing in efforts to shape service innovation capabilities. Findings suggests that initiatives associated with adoption of advanced technology are likely to improve service transformation abilities and service innovation performance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Dynamic capability theory; Mobile information technology (MIT); Service innovation; Technological innovation diffusion theory","Internet protocols; Manufacture; Surveys; Dynamic capability theory; Dynamics capability; Innovation capability; Innovation diffusion theory; Innovation performance; Mobile information; Mobile information technology; Service innovation; Technological innovation; Technological innovation diffusion theory; Digital storage; advanced technology; industrial enterprise; information technology; innovation; manufacturing; technology adoption; technology diffusion; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137166404

However, previous studies on HSC have not focused on the types of resilience capabilities supported by respective DT or taken a holistic perspective of resilience from both proactive and reactive dimensions. In order to address this gap, we conducted a study of eight healthcare organizations based on semi-structured interviews with 15 HSC managers and document analysis. As a result, we identified 14 DT, such as big data analytics, predictive health data analysis, and remote monitoring of inventories. These DT supported organizational capabilities of resilient HSC, such as long-term collaborative planning and strategic alliances based on trust and shared goals. These findings were articulated in a framework that describes what and how technology adoption improves HSC resilience. We also present four research propositions for theory-testing in future studies, which stress that the relationship between DT and the four major potentials of resilient systems (i.e., anticipating, responding, monitoring and learning) is mediated by organizational resilience capabilities. The framework is expected to offer guidance and ideas for managers and policy-makers interested in designing and operating resilient HSC. © 2022","Healthcare digitalization; Healthcare supply chain; Resilience; Smart supply chain","Data Analytics; Decision making; Health care; Managers; Predictive analytics; Uncertainty analysis; Decision makers; Digital technologies; Disruptive event; Healthcare digitalization; Healthcare organizations; Healthcare supply chain; Holistic perspectives; Resilience; Semi structured interviews; Smart supply chain; Supply chains; health care; organization; supply chain management; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137164073

This study endeavours to overcome the shortcomings in the palm oil industry that is fragmented and unclear. This study develops a structural literature review published in 2011–2021. This study presents a conceptualization framework through four cluster groups (1) industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application; (2) sustainability practices; (3) sustainability performance; and (4) moderating factors. Subsequently, the present study develops nine propositions from these concepts due to descriptive and content analyses. Then, the study theorizes that industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application has a quasi-effect on sustainability performance, and sustainability practices may act as a mediator in this relationship and a moderating factor that may influence the above relationship. This study contributes to both theory and practice by advancing the current understanding of industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application in the POI, especially its impact on sustainability practices and performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Industry 4.0; Palm oil industry; Propositions; Structured literature review","Economic and social effects; Industry 4.0; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Literature reviews; Moderating factors; Oil industries; Oil supply chain; Palm oil industry; Proposition; Structured literature review; Sustainability performance; Sustainability practices; Palm oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137072337

We leverage latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling to identify the topics and themes in white papers. Nine topics are identified through LDA: company description, distributed ledger technology components, energy and green issues, financial and legal issues, artificial intelligence, and tech applications in different industries—specifically, healthcare, manufacturing and construction, education, and financial services. We find that energy and green issues represent one of the most prominent topics among all types of projects and that their disclosure is positively related to the probability of campaign success and the amount of funding raised. Another prominent topic that affects campaign outcomes is technology in the healthcare industry, reflecting wider investment trends in this sector. Our results may help entrepreneurs to improve their campaign disclosures and present new issues for policymakers regarding investments in digital tokens. © 2022","Blockchain; Disclosure; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Security token offering; Topic modelling; White paper","Distributed ledger; Health care; Investments; Paper; Statistics; Block-chain; Disclosure; Energy; Fundings; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Modeling analyzes; Security token offering; Security tokens; Topic Modeling; White papers; Blockchain; artificial intelligence; financial crisis; financial market; health care; numerical model; policy making; probability; social change; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137069782

SRI considers the corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria of firms is becoming an emerging topic in economics and management. The aim of this paper is to develop a hybrid SRI portfolio selection model with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) techniques. First, a multi-dimensional evaluation criteria system containing fundamental financial indicators, CSR criteria, and stock market factors, is put forward for SRI to make the decision results more comprehensive and applicable. Second, a multi-stage MCDM decision mechanism including the affinity propagation clustering (APC) algorithm, the best-worst method (BWM), and the MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of a Ratio Analysis plus the full MULTIplicative form) is implemented. The APC algorithm is used for the reduction of financial indicators. The BWM is applied to determine the financial and CSR criteria weights. The MULTIMOORA method is integrated to derive the financial and CSR performance of the firms. Third, a multi-objective SRI portfolio selection model adding financial, CSR, and stock market performance is constructed, which serves as an extension of the classical mean-variance model. The compromise solution is utilized when solving the MOOP. Finally, a case study related to the medical stock investment is examined to recommend the optimal portfolio allocation for investors. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are performed to demonstrate the robustness, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed methodology. © 2022","Corporate social responsibility; Multi-criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization; Portfolio selection; Socially responsible investment","Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Corporate social responsibility; Investments portfolios; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Portfolio selection; Portfolio selection models; Socially responsible investments; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; comparative study; corporate social responsibility; decision making; numerical model; optimization; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137012041

This is true in stable situations as well as in times of uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the literature on supplier selection criteria that would help identify suppliers that support the success of the buying firm, we identify a previously unnoticed criterion: a supplier's complexity. In this study, we examine the relationship between supplier complexity and buyer disruptions. Normal accident theory suggests that complex firms are more prone to disruption, while social systems theory views firm-level complexity as essential in avoiding disruption. Given these two opposing theoretical viewpoints, this study examines whether and how supplier complexity affects numbers of disruptions experienced by the buyers. Our data collection entails 59 buyer-supplier dyads, extended to a triadic context (i.e., buyer-supplier-supplier), through a survey taken from 118 German manufacturing firms. The results show that both the internal complexity of a supplier and the complexity of the collaboration with other suppliers increases the number of disruptions experienced by the buyer. A high degree of supplier dependence can dampen this effect. These results introduce a supplier's complexity as a relevant criterion for supplier selection and shed light on the moderating influence of supplier dependency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Firm complexity; Risk management; Supplier selection; Supply chain disruptions","COVID-19; Sales; Supply chains; Firm complexity; Long-term impacts; Normal accident theory; Performance; Risks management; Selection criteria; Social systems; Supplier selection; Supply-chain disruptions; Uncertainty; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136558216

Our theoretical framework draws from a dynamic model of international trade, which accounts for firms' heterogeneity in productivity levels and in the returns to productivity enhancing investments. We test the predictions of our model using UK and Spanish company account data, over the 1995–2010 period merged with information of companies' online status. The period analysed is associated with the early stage of internet diffusion and our sample countries represent fast (the UK) and slow (Spain) diffusion. Our results show that website adoption is associated with higher productivity growth and with a reduction in market concentration in both countries. The increase in competition operates via a negative selection mechanism, whereby productivity growth is inversely related to the pre-entry productivity levels.

The development of the Internet economy provides a perfect opportunity for China to realize the coordinated development of the economy and low-carbon society. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2006 to 2017, this paper explores the relationship between the Internet economy and CEE by using the instrumental variable-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) method. It also investigates the internal mechanism and heterogeneity analysis. The main results show that (1) the Internet economy positively affects CEE in China; in other words, a 1 % increase in Internet economy indicators will contribute to an increase of CEE indicators by 0.141 %; (2) the Internet economy indirectly affects CEE by increasing human capital, clean technological innovation, and the non-coal energy mix; and (3) there is a significant asymmetric relationship between the Internet economy and CEE, with the negative influence of the Internet economy on CEE being more significant in southern China.

However, using three total factor productivity functions and controlling for ROA in the current period, with increasing DPAD treatment and intensity, higher production efficiency was positively associated with the following year's ROA. The effect sizes are meaningful for the moderation effects. The findings are robust to a sub-sample of firms with only US-based operations, placebo estimates, effects of state-level depreciation rates and allowances, effects of DPAD treatment and intensity among industries of the supply chain members, and alternative control variables and sub-samples.

With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, institutional investors are shifting their focus from profit-making to sustainable and ethical investment. Investors are majorly focussing on ESG measures with financial incentives while making investment decisions. Empirical evidences indicate that firms disclosing ESG measures are likely to outperform others by reducing the risk and enhancing the economic performance, although the results may vary. ESG measures not only promote economic incentives but also encourage sustainable production through value accretive supply chain mechanism. The present study tries to explore the ESG disclosure-Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) nexus w.r.t the presence of sustainable value chains, considering the panel data of 1,170 firm-level observations from 2012 to 2020. In order to resolve endogeneity issue, we use Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) and system GMM approach. The study also focuses on the presence of foreign ownership along with the environmental and social supply chain management practices in ESG–CFP nexus.

The extreme cold weather triggered an unprecedented increase of electricity demand and simultaneous failure of multiple electricity grid components. The dual effect caused a widespread power outage that left millions of Texans without power for days. This paper estimates the indirect economy-wide cascading impact of that power outage. It utilized historical make and use tables between 1997 and 2019 in an inoperability input-output analysis-based economic impact assessment model to quantify the expected indirect cost of the power outage in terms of the loss of gross domestic product of Texas. This research found that expected loss to be approximately $664 million in 2019 values. It also found that in Texas industries such as oil and gas extraction, petroleum, coal products, and so on are particularly vulnerable to such weather-related prolonged power outages. The outcomes of this paper can be used in planning for strategies to make the grid robust, reliable, and resilient to severe weather events. The identification of vulnerable industries can also help in planning for auxiliary capacities so the cascading economic impacts of the weather-related power outages can be reduced. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Economic impact assessment; Grid resilience; Input-output model; Interindustry relationships; Severe weather-induced power outages; Texas grid failure","Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Storms; Economic impact assessment; Economic impacts; Grid resilience; Impact assessments; Input-output modeling; Interindustry relationship; Power outage; Severe weather; Severe weather-induced power outage; Texas grid failure; Outages",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134896087

Each worker drives a vehicle and so the task allocation problem is often solved as a vehicle routing problem. However, unlike delivery services, the workers spend the majority of their time working on the service tasks leaving the vehicles idle. This creates a possibility of sharing vehicles among the workers to save vehicles used and reduce the total carbon emissions. This paper studies this new problem of vehicle sharing and task allocation. Given the team of workers and a set of customer tasks with their locations and time requirements, decisions need to be made on the scheduling of workers to tasks, workers sharing each vehicle and the routing of the vehicles. We first formulate the problem as an integer programming model. To solve larger problem instances, a three-phase heuristic algorithm is then developed. Computational experiments are carried out to demonstrate the benefits of sharing vehicles. The effects of problem parameters on the solution are also investigated. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heuristics; Integer programming; Routing; Scheduling; Vehicle sharing","Heuristic algorithms; Sales; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Allocation problems; Heuristic; Heuristic solutions; Integer Program- ming; MILP formulation; Routings; Scheduling; Task allocation; Vehicle sharing; Workers'; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134565972

However, how to find compromise solutions for MCDM problems remains an open question in the SMAA family. A compromise solution refers to an alternative that is the closest to the ideal solution. In this paper, we propose an improved SMAA method, called the SMAA with compromise solutions (SMAA-CO), to determine compromise solutions for MCDM problems with the uncertain preferences of decision makers and conflicting criteria. The SMAA-CO uses nonmonotonic additive value functions to depict decision makers’ ideal values for reference points. We apply the proposed method to capture multiple decision makers’ uncertain preference information. An illustrative example concerning supplier selection in the pulp and paper industry is used to show the applicability of the proposed method. Some managerial insights are given. © 2021 The Authors.

This paper proposes a technique for overcoming this significant limitation, as compared to neural networks. Specifically, this paper proposes the use of larger and denser-than-application need rule-fact networks which are trained, pruned, manually reviewed and then re-trained for use. Multiple types of networks are evaluated under multiple operating conditions and these results are presented and assessed.

China is the world's largest mariculture producer, with 66% of global production share in 2018. However, different categories of mariculture products have varied nutrient composition and environmental impacts, and ignoring such heterogeneity potentially misleads policy decision making in mariculture development in China. Here, we compare the environmental and nutritional performance of 28 mariculture products with 7 LPPs produced in China. Our results show that although mariculture products are more environmentally friendly than LPPs on the whole, not all mariculture products have better nutrition-environmental performance than LPPs. Only 17 out of 28 mariculture products, mainly shellfish and fish, are found to be both nutritionally and environmentally more friendly than LPPs. Shellfish are promising substitutes for LPPs due to their minor environmental impact, higher nutrient density, greater production volume and lower average price compared with other mariculture products. However, upper dietary limits on daily intake of shellfish due to potential overconsumption of certain micronutrients must also be considered. We also found mariculture derived fish have no distinct environmental, nutritional or cost benefits over some LPPs, such as egg and chicken. The current structure of the mariculture industry in China may be optimized by expanding the production of nutrient-rich mariculture products with low environmental impact and affordable price. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Land-based protein products (LPPs); Mariculture products; Nitrogen footprint; Nutrient density; Water footprint","Decision making; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fish; Marine biology; Nutrients; Nutrition; Global production; Land-based protein product; Mariculture product; Nitrogen footprints; Nutrient composition; Nutrient contents; Nutrient density; Policy decisions; Production share; Water footprint; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137164081

Findings: The authors find that more joint board management meetings are associated with lower earnings management. This is consistent with joint board management meetings providing net information sharing benefits. Additional testing indicates that the results are the strongest when firms hold more joint board management meetings than regular board meetings.

The option of ordering online and fulfillment by offline stores significantly decreases the use of packaging materials. The aim of this paper is to introduce an analytical model to support the decision of an omnichannel strategy implementation while simultaneously optimizing the offline stores' density, pricing strategy, and environmental impact of packaging materials. Two omnichannel models are compared, the Buy-Online-and-Pick-Up in-Store (BOPS) mode and a combination of the BOPS mode plus a Ship-From-Store (SFS) mode (BOPS + SFS). The BOPS and BOPS + SFS modes consider an inconvenience cost for consumers who decide to pick up their product at the offline store. The consumers' inconvenience cost is a function of the distance to the offline stores, which suggests that a greater stores' density results in a lower inconvenience cost. The proposed analytical model shows that both the BOPS and the BOPS + SFS modes support a reduction of the environmental impact of packaging materials when compared with the online-only mode. Moreover, there is an optimal offline stores' density that maximizes profits while reducing packaging materials. The density of offline stores is a strategic planning decision to balance operating costs and consumer inconvenience costs. The fulfillment of online orders through physical stores is an encouraging strategy to solve the problem of over-packaging and improves the customer's experience through fast and convenient order pickup; furthermore, it is aligned with the interests of environmentally aware customers. The research findings can guide decision makers when analyzing an omnichannel implementation or searching for improvement opportunities in sustainable e-commerce. © 2022","Omnichannel retailing; Packaging reduction; Store density; Sustainable e-commerce","Decision making; Electronic commerce; Environmental impact; Operating costs; Packaging; Pickups; Sustainable development; % reductions; E- commerces; Material consumption; Offline; Omnichannel retailing; Packaging reduction; Pricing strategy; Store density; Strategy implementations; Sustainable e-commerce; Packaging materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136498191

Water and energy systems are highly interdependent, and water efficiency and energy efficiency are two related indicators for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. It is critical to improve energy–water use efficiency to sustain socioeconomic development while reducing adverse effects on natural resources, society and the environment. By using longitudinal energy–water use data for China over the past 21 years, this paper develops a temporo-spatial study to address key issues and introduce analytical approaches needed to understand the water–energy nexus and support integrated resource planning and management to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Decomposition analysis indicates that the production effect was the dominating factor contributing the increase in the country's energy–water use, while energy–water efficiency is the major factor slowing the growth of the country's energy–water use. Changes and trends analyses show that the country's energy intensity, water intensity, and water/energy ratio significantly decreased from 1999 to 2019, but the rate of decline has slowed. The disparities of the country's provincial energy intensities, water intensities, and water/energy ratios significantly decreased with economic growth. Results suggest that improving energy–water efficiency is critical for the country to curb increasing energy and water use and achieve resource and environmental protection targets with rapid economic development. The disparities between regional energy-water efficiencies can be reduced along with economic growth, while an overheated economy can widen the disparities and result in unsustainable and inefficient utilization of resources. Government coordination, targets and policy as part of the efficiency governance system are critical for continuous energy–water efficiency improvement and directly influence the implementation and effectiveness of energy–water efficiency policy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Disparity; Energy efficiency; Equity; Sustainable development; Water efficiency; Water–energy nexus","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy Intensity; Environmental protection; Information management; Planning; Country energies; Disparity; Energy; Energy use; Equity; Water and energies; Water efficiency'; Water energy; Water use; Water–energy nexus; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136481636

However, measuring fairness perceptions is challenging because various context and design characteristics of ADM systems need to be disentangled. Particularly, ADM applications need to use the right degree of automation and granularity of data input to achieve efficiency and public acceptance. We present results from a large-scale vignette experiment that assessed fairness perceptions and the acceptability of ADM systems. The experiment varied context and design dimensions, with an emphasis on who makes the final decision. We show that automated recommendations in combination with a final human decider are perceived as fair as decisions made by a dominant human decider and as fairer than decisions made only by an algorithm.

In this study, we extend the classical ER approach to the linguistic belief-based ER (LB-ER) approach in which the hesitancy degrees are introduced to determine the weights of experts. Afterwards, the LB-ER approach is further enhanced to deal with multi-expert multi-criteria decision-making (MEMCDM) problems, where the best worst method (BWM) is introduced to generate the weights of criteria.

When stochastic uncertainty is involved in the datasets, robust support vector regression (SVR) models are useful. In this study, we proposed a kernel-free quadratic surface support vector regression (QSSVR) model based on optimal margin distribution (OMD). This model minimizes the variance of the functional margins of all data points to achieve better generalization capability. When the data points exhibit stochastic uncertainty (without the assumption of any specific distribution), the covariance information of noise is employed to construct a robust OMD-based QSSVR (RQSSVR-OMD) model, with a set of probabilistic constraints to ensure its worst-case performance. Moreover, the probabilistic constraints in the proposed model are proven to be equivalently reformulated as second-order cone constraints for efficient implementation. Extensive computational experiments on public benchmark datasets were conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed RQSSVR-OMD model over other well-established SVR models in terms of forecasting accuracy and time. The proposed model was also validated to successfully handle real-life uncertain battery data for battery power-consumption forecasting. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Battery power consumption forecasting; Kernel-free SVM; Optimal margin distribution; Robust forecasting model; Support vector regression","Benchmarking; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Vectors; Battery power consumption; Battery power consumption forecasting; Forecasting models; Kernel-free SVM; Margin distributions; Optimal margin distribution; Robust forecasting model; Stochastic uncertainties; Support vector regression models; Support vector regressions; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136125097

Using structural equation modeling analyzing the data from 308 manufacturers in China by AMOS 21.0 software, we find that ecological design and investment recovery can directly enhance companies’ performance. Also, environmental and innovation performances mediate the positive effects of circular economy practices on financial performance. Meanwhile, implementing ecological design contributes to investment recovery.

Recent technological development has emerged various methods for aluminum production to improve production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, while reducing energy intensity in traditional production practices can also lower emissions and remain low production costs. However, which approach that performs better in achieving economic benefits and reducing environmental impacts is unclear. This study analyzed six major aluminum production methods based on alumina production process and energy mix. Environmental parameters were derived based on life cycle assessment, and economic cost parameters were formed by building an economic benefits model. This paper then analyzed the potential of achieving economic benefits and environmental impacts reduction for each method using life cycle assessment and principal component analysis. Finally, the greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminum industry in 2030 based on scenario analysis was analyzed. We found that Bayer process-hydropower method performs the best in reducing environmental impacts and achieving economic benefits, while the sinter process-thermal power method performs the worst. The effect of reducing emissions by changing the energy mix (75%) was more significant than that by changing the alumina production process (up to 10%). Furthermore, we used scenario analysis to expand the capacity share of the Bayer process-hydropower method with optimal comprehensive benefit increased by 22.2%, the cost of electricity decreased by 313.77 CNY/t-Al, and the global warming potential was reduced by nearly 1/3. Thus, our results reveal the significant benefits of the Chinese government's push to increase the share of clean energy applications in the aluminum industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminum industry; Economic benefits; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment; Principal component analysis","Alumina; Aluminum; Aluminum oxide; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Industrial economics; Principal component analysis; Production efficiency; Alumina production; Aluminum industry; Aluminum production; Economic benefits; Energy mix; Life cycle assessment; Principal-component analysis; Production methods; Production process; Scenarios analysis; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135934113

Furthermore, it has been anecdotally reported that 18 to 30-year-olds have the highest propensity to generate large amounts of food waste and thus need to be urgently engaged in communication that helps them change their behaviour. This study aims to explore young adults' capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivations (M) that may lead to a certain behaviour (B) towards food waste disposal practices (FWDP) grounded on the Behaviour Change Wheel, also called the COM-B model, and could reveal barriers to action. In doing so, a case study approach is used via Harrow Council residents in England within the age group of 18–30 years old. The study took place amid the national lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic and targeted young residents within the 18–30 age group using a structured interview approach with a diagnostic questionnaire promoted through Harrow Council's social media account, followed by in-depth interviews with eligible participants. Out of the 30 residents who completed the diagnostic questionnaire, 35% reported no FWDP, 42% partial FWDP (i.e., some incorrect items in the black bin waste), and 23% reported engaging in FWDP. The first two groups only were invited to the online interviews. The interview results are organised using the COM-B model and reveal that: 1) due to Covid-19 there was a shift to home cooking and increased food waste generation (B); 2) there is a lack of FWDP knowledge, information on benefits, and advice on alleviating pests/health concerns from councils, whereas FWDP differences between councils and reliance on ‘common sense’ often create confusion around FWDP (C); 3) the council may not always provide a caddy or a drop-off/collection service, whereas economic (caddy liners purchase) and logistic concerns (e.g., the lack of a regular collection schedule, unfavourable features of the caddy, and lack of prompts/reminders) resulted to limited uptake of FWDP as the norm (O); 4) the benefits of FWDP do not outweigh costs, while feelings of disgust and a sense of inconvenience lead to lack of or partial FWDP (M). To our knowledge, this is the first study using the COM-B model within the context of FWDP and with a specific focus on young adults in England. Novel theoretical and practical insights are discussed, along with limitations and future research directions. © 2022","Behaviour change wheel; Domestic food waste; England; Food waste disposal practices; Residents; Young adults","Cooking; Digital storage; Motivation; Surveys; Waste disposal; B-models; Behavior change wheel; Behaviour changes; Domestic food waste; England; Food waste; Food waste disposal practice; Resident; Young adults; Wheels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135890621

In this paper, we assess whether small regular cash transfers strengthen poor households' ability to mitigate the welfare effects of drought shocks. We analyze mechanisms through which cash transfers contribute to resilience, including savings, asset accumulation as well as income smoothing in agriculture and off-farm activities. We combine household survey data collected as part of a randomized control trial in rural Niger with satellite data used to identify exogenous rainfall shocks. The results show that cash transfers increase household consumption by about 10 percent on average. Importantly, this increase is mostly concentrated among households affected by drought shocks, for whom welfare impacts are larger than transfer amounts due to households' enhanced ability to protect earnings in agriculture and off-farm businesses when shocks occur. The results suggest that multi-year cash transfer programs can foster poor households’ resilience by facilitating savings and income smoothing. © 2022 The World Bank","Cash transfers; Climatic shocks; Income smoothing; Poverty; Resilience; Sahel","Agriculture; Surveys; Cash transfer; Climatic shock; Household surveys; Income smoothing; Policy makers; Poor households; Poverty; Resilience; Sahel; Welfare effects; Drought; climate change; drought; household survey; poverty; rainfall; satellite data; savings; socioeconomic conditions; Niger; Sahel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139851499

In Australia's National Electricity Market, the ability of new variable renewable energy (VRE) plant to arrange requisite project finance at favourable rates largely determines project viability. Such financings are typically only achieved when VRE projects are underpinned by long-dated Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), under which prices are guaranteed by an investment-grade counterparty. In this article, we quantify the relationship between PPAs, counterparty credit quality and the cost of capital in the context of Australia's energy-only wholesale market under conditions of policy uncertainty. Our analysis benefits from the application of confidential data from Australia's capital markets. We find higher credit quality drives higher gearing, and somewhat counterintuitively, lower expected returns to equity. This in turn produces a lower cost of capital and by implication, higher post-construction VRE plant valuations. This outcome may appear to be at odds with Modigliani and Miller's classic 1958 article but of course it is not, risk has merely been repackaged and reallocated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cost of capital; Counterparty credit; PPAs; Project finance; Renewable energy","Costs; Digital storage; Electric industry; Energy policy; Power markets; Australia; Cost of capital; Counterparty credit; National electricity markets; PPA; Project finance; Renewable energies; Renewable energy plants; Renewable energy projects; Variable renewable energies; Investments; alternative energy; capital; cost analysis; electricity; energy market; finance; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139215584

The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the OECD, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework.

This paper examines the impact of power disturbances in the supply chain for four industries: manufacturing, durable goods manufacturing, nondurable goods manufacturing, and total private industry. This indirect impact includes the losses at downstream firms that might not receive supplies on time due to disturbances at their suppliers' facilities. This is measured using observations of value added before and after power disturbances rather than the more common method of modeling an economy. This paper tests four hypotheses related to the effect of power disturbances with all four of them being supported by the model results. Further, using simulation we estimate the indirect costs of power disturbances. The results suggest that power disturbances have a statistically significant effect on gross domestic product (i.e., value added), particularly in manufacturing where power disturbances in the supply chain had a statistically significant effect. While this industry represents 12.8% of private industry value added, it experiences 36.8% of the supply chain losses due to power disturbances, as suggested by the results of the simulation. Power disturbances in the supply chain affected all four industries with nondurable goods being affected the most. This creates a significant disconnect between the stakeholder that invests in reliability in the power grid and the stakeholders that experience the bulk of losses. © 2022","Power disturbance; Power outage; Supply chain; Value added","Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Manufacture; Outages; Down-stream; Durable goods; Economic activities; Method of modeling; Nondurable goods; Power disturbances; Power outage; Private industries; Supply-chain disruptions; Value added; Supply chains; economic activity; electricity industry; electricity supply; Gross Domestic Product; manufacturing; private sector; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138461336

The inclusion and support that project organizations devote to local communities form a crucial part of a project's delivery and social sustainability considerations, yet this has only recently attracted attention in project studies. To address social sustainability, project managers should reinforce accountability and the inclusion of ‘new voices’ in the project decision-making process. Through mixed-methods research, this paper contributes to the project stakeholder engagement discourse and normative stance of stakeholder theory concerning the role of local communities and examines the ways in which inclusion can provide a response to the sustainability challenges of major projects. Findings suggest means-ends decoupling situations where current project management practices towards communities' engagement are weakly linked to their goals and induced by convergent pressures and reactive mechanisms, thus preventing an inclusive decision-making process. © 2022","Local Communities; Major Construction Projects; Means-Ends Decoupling; Social Sustainability; Stakeholder Inclusion","Decision making; Project management; Decision-making process; Decouplings; Local community; Major construction project; Mean-end decoupling; Means ends; Project delivery; Project organization; Social sustainability; Stakeholder inclusion; Sustainable development; accountability; construction; decision making; local participation; project management; stakeholder; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137175384

Given the huge future growth of the carbon emissions of the transport sector and its tight links to socio-economic development, the introduction of new energy vehicles can not only reduce carbon emissions but also decarbonize the entire economic system by decreasing carbon intensity. Taking advantage of a promotion project in China as a natural experiment, this paper explores the causal effect of promoting new energy vehicles on reducing carbon intensity. Our empirical results show that the promotion of new energy vehicles decreases the carbon intensity in demonstration cities by about 4.5% and decomposition analyses show that less than one-fifths of the decrease comes from the reduction of carbon emissions, and the other four-fifths result from the increases in outputs. Mechanism analyses suggest that in terms of passenger vehicles, this project increases the number of newly registered pure electric passengers motor vehicles, but has no influence on public transportation and taxis. Moreover, the promotion of new energy vehicles by this project is not brought about by the subsidy policy for the private purchase of them. We also put forward some policy recommendations for constructing a low-carbon transport system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions reduction; Carbon intensity; New energy vehicles; Subsidy policy","Economic and social effects; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Purchasing; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon intensity; Decomposition analysis; Economic system; Natural experiment; New energy vehicles; Socio-economic development; Subsidy policy; Transport sectors; Carbon; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact; subsidy system; transport vehicle; transportation system; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137168873

Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica is a main afforested species in northeastern China; however, little work has been carried out assessing the canopy interception loss of this plant species in semi-humid areas. Accordingly, a rainfall interception experiment was conducted for P. sylvestris plots in a semi-humid area of northeastern China from June to September 2019. The revised Gash analytical model was then applied to the canopy interception values, and its regional applicability was tested. During the experimental process, incident rainfall (P), throughfall (Tf), and stemflow events (Sf) were collected and measured, while meteorological data were simultaneously obtained on-site. The Penman (PM) equation and the Gash regression method were used to estimate evaporation rates (E) from the saturated canopy, and the Leyton constraint method was applied to obtain canopy storage capacity (S). Parameters such as E, S, stemflow partitioning coefficient (pt), and trunk storage capacity (St) were scaled to the canopy cover fraction per unit area (producing Ec, Sc, ptc, and Stc in the revised Gash analytical model, respectively) for use in the simulated rainfall interception. The proportions of measured canopy interception (I), Sf, and Tf accounted for 17.2 %, 6.0 %, and 76.8 % of P, respectively; whereas the Sc, ptc, and Stc were calculated as 1.60 mm, 0.067, and 0.21 mm, respectively, over the experimental period. The revised Gash analytical model with Ec varied from 0.37 to 0.93, and Ec/R varied from 0.62 to 1.55 (acquired via the PM equation), thus indicating its ability to accurately simulate P. sylvestris canopy interception. These findings can provide a theoretical foundation for understanding correlated ecological and hydrological processes, allowing land managers to predict the impacts of afforestation on water inputs for current and future rainfall scenarios in typical coniferous forests of semi-humid regions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Canopy interception; Mongolian Scots pine; Revised Gash model; Semi humid area; Stemflow; Throughfall","Budget control; Digital storage; Profitability; Rain; Reforestation; Regression analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Value engineering; Water resources; Canopy interception; Gash model; Humid areas; Mongolian scot pine; Mongolians; Revised gash model; Scots pine; Semi humid area; Stemflow; Throughfall; Analytical models; interception; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137166232

We model the companies’ competition as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP), in which the bike users’ bike selection and demand fulfillment behavior is described by a set of nonlinear logical constraints. We then reformulate the nonlinear model into a linear one, whose equilibrium solution can be solved by commercial solvers. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to improve the decision making process of the competing companies, and to draw insights on the associated market performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bikesharing; Competition; Docked; Generalized Nash equilibrium; Pricing","Bicycles; Commerce; Computation theory; Decision making; Docks; Game theory; Hydraulic structures; Resource allocation; Bikesharing; Docked; Fleet sizes; Game theoretical models; Generalized Nash equilibrium; Operational decisions; Pricing and resource allocation; Resource planning; Station location; Strategic decisions; Costs; competition (economics); cycle transport; price dynamics; resource allocation; transportation development; transportation economics; travel demand; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136503431

Extant literature proposes that firms’ R&D investments and their profitability and capital market performance are reciprocally related. However, the direction of these relationships and their temporal nature are unclear. We take a real options perspective to argue that the long-run firm performance effects of R&D investments are better than their short-term ones, and that the initial level of R&D intensity influences the nature of these relationships. We apply panel vector autoregression (P-VAR) to a sample of 6623 U.S. firms over the 1990–2020 period in order to test our hypotheses. Our results indicate that increases in R&D intensity have negative effects on profitability in the short term, yet these effects diminish relatively quickly. The effects of increases in R&D intensity on capital market performance are positive and persist over time. Consistent with our predictions, they are contingent on the initial levels of R&D intensity and performance. The findings are fundamentally in line with the real options perspective employed here, yet they add important nuance to our understanding of when, how, and under which conditions R&D investments and firm performance affect one another. © 2022 The Authors","Capital market performance; Panel vector autoregression; Profitability; Real options; Research and development","Commerce; Competition; Financial markets; Investments; Regression analysis; Value engineering; Capital market performance; Development investment; Firm Performance; Market performance; Panel vector autoregression; Real Options; Real options perspectives; Research and development; Research investment; Vector autoregressions; Profitability; capital market; industrial performance; investment; profitability; research and development; vector autoregression; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136472274

Despite these positives, the challenge remains of how to compare the performance of different organisations from different sectors. This research aimed to develop a methodology to effectively compare companies across sectors using UK utilities across the water and sewage, energy, and communications sectors as a case study. A methodology was constructed based on service, environmental, and financial metrics, and cross-sector benchmarking was undertaken, which generated performance scores based on company metrics relative to sector peers. This circumnavigated issues of indicators often being mismatched across sectors and the lack of relevance and context when sectors do use similar indicators. Results showed that the sample of 18 utilities had two distinct clusters, one of eight sector leaders and the other of ten lower performers. Sky had the highest overall score of 13.5 (maximum 15), suggesting it significantly outperformed the rest of the communications sector. Similarly, British Gas and SSE lead the energy sector, whilst Wessex, Severn Trent, and United Utilities lead the way for water and sewage companies. The two distinct groups of sector leaders and lower performers can be employed to identify other companies that may offer learning opportunities. Top performers can assess top performers in other sectors to identify how they might continue improving, rather than be potentially limited within their sectors. Conversely, lower-performing companies can look within and across sectors to identify best practices to improve their performance. The methodological development and UK utility sustainability results collectively provide novel insight into the water, energy, and communication sectors and contribute to the international academic literature on benchmarking by illustrating an alternative and unique solution to comparing diverse sectors in any region. © 2022 The Authors","Cross-industry; Efficiency; Performance analysis; Sustainability; Utility benchmarking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136466232

Our main contribution is to show that CEO duality moderates this relationship. Dual CEOs have a high control of the board that reduces oversight and increases their job security.

However, it remains largely unclear whether or not there are complementary effects on performance which can be achieved by adopting them together. This paper bridges this gap through an empirical study. Drawing upon the resource-based view and complementarity theory, original quantitative primary data is collected through a survey of supply chain managers working for companies operating in Brazil. The individual and joint effects on sustainability of adopting CE and Industry 4.0 technologies (including economic, environmental, and social measures) and firms’ operational performance are examined. Our original findings indicate that there is indeed a synergistic effect on performance resulting from joint adoption of CE and Industry 4.0 technologies; in addition, the isolated adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies does not affect social performance. However, through the joint adoption of CE and Industry 4.0 technologies, a positive influence on social performance is identified. This paper contributes to the literature by (i) confirming a potential synergistic effect between CE and Industry 4.0 technologies, as well as revealing their importance to business operations and social performance, and (ii) extending the contributions of previous conceptual and exploratory studies on the nexus of CE and Industry 4.0. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Digital technologies; Industry 4.0; Sustainability; Sustainable operations; Sustainable performance","Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Industry 4.0; Supply chains; Circular economy; Digital technologies; Economic management; Performance; Production economics; Production operations; Social performance; Sustainable operations; Sustainable performance; Synergistic effect; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135876791

To reduce these effects, more circular flow is needed, which requires significant innovation. This paper asks w hat are the types of innovations that make plastic packaging more circular, and what is their level of adoption? Over 300 circular innovations are identified and categorized according to Reason's failure mode model, which suggests how failure can be prevented in a system. This results in six types of innovation that are critical to preventing failure (plastic leakage) or enabling circularity throughout the plastic packaging value chain. Circular innovations must address all these failure modes: packaging design choice, consumer behavior, material recovery, material treatment, and material reuse. The study also finds that adoption of circular plastic packaging innovations is low but media and scholarly attention are increasing. This study contributes to the literature by showing how circular innovations address possible failure points within value chain material flows.

In this work, we explore how the domains of smart cities, smart transport, and smart energy will evolve until 2030 from a scientific and technological perspective, as a means to inform future policies for urban development in Europe. We started our work with an extensive review of recent and relevant research, covering policy and market reports, scientific journal articles, and other scientific publications. Then, a two-round Delphi survey with 120 field experts was conducted to assess the plausibility of the literature review findings to materialize until 2030. According to our empirical findings, there will be several speedy and structural changes in the three domains: we were able to identify a set of 18 statements that are highly probable to become reality in the next decade, whereas 17 statements were classified as plausible but not highly probable, and three statements raised controversiality. This work provides significant added value in supporting territorial policymakers' and stakeholders' decision making under uncertainty, as well as in designing highly relevant research agendas, attuned to contemporary and emerging trends. © 2022 The Authors","Delphi survey; Foresight; Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI); Urban development; Urban policy","Decision making; Surveys; Urban growth; Urban transportation; City transport; Delphi surveys; Energy trends; Foresight; Future trends; Key process; Responsible research and innovation; Urban development; Urban policy; Urban settings; Smart city; Delphi analysis; energy use; innovation; research work; smart city; urban development; urban policy; urban transport; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135828635

Grant St., West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States","The outstanding advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an intensive study of the UAV system over the past decade. A variety of potential UAV applications are emerging nowadays, and UAV delivery is one in the limelight. However, one of the critical issues for UAV delivery service is how UAVs can be persistently used within their fundamental limited battery capacity. One recent approach to alleviate the weaknesses is using a cooperative system of UAVs with movable stations for the delivery logistics. The movable stations move across the field of operation, providing persistent delivery service using UAVs by efficiently replenishing the consumables of UAVs. In this study, one of the compelling cooperative delivery services called the flying warehouse system is investigated. The concept of the flying warehouse delivery service has firstly filed as a patent by the e-commerce giant Amazon. The service utilizes airborne fulfillment centers (AFCs), an airship that floats at an altitude of around 45,000. The airship has stocked with inventory, and when a customer places an order, UAVs fly down and deliver the package. The AFC is a novel delivery system that allows delivery in under 10 min and expands Amazon Prime members' access to UAV shipping. On the other hand, AFC is a challenging system that must extract the simultaneous operating schedule of the different system elements. For this purpose, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed. The proposed MILP enables the derivation of service schedules of multiple AFCs and their components. The validity of the MILP is tested through case studies and quantitatively investigated system managerial issues. In addition, we proposed a clustering-based solution approach to provide computational efficiency for real-world case problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Airborne fulfillment center; Flying warehouse; Managerial guidelines; Mathematical optimization; Rolling horizon approach; UAV delivery","Airships; Computational efficiency; Integer programming; Lime; Managers; Scheduling; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Warehouses; Aerial vehicle; Airborne fulfillment center; Delivery service; Flying warehouse; Managerial guideline; Mathematical optimizations; Rolling horizon; Rolling horizon approach; Unmanned aerial vehicle delivery; Vehicle delivery; Antennas; aircraft; conceptual framework; guideline; numerical model; optimization; quantitative analysis; unmanned vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135819007

First, relative to the traditional Global North sources, China has become a major source of ICT in SSA. Second, over the past two decades, Chinese firms operating in SSA have adopted a Schumpeterian character to gain legitimacy in the communities in which they operate. Third, with the easier transfer of ICT from China, local ICT firms in SSA have upgraded their value chains from only delivering information services to becoming important players in the financial sector, including the provision of mobile money transfer services. We conclude that China's expansive size, coupled with its ability to produce technologies for low-income economies, is likely to ensure that it will remain the dominant source of ICT innovations for SSA. © 2022 The Authors","Business legitimacy; Schumpeter; Technical change; Technology transfer; Value chain upgrade","Economic and social effects; Information services; Business legitimacy; Information and Communication Technologies; Information and Communication Technology sectors; Schumpeter; Sources of informations; Sub-saharan africa; Technical change; Upgrading technologies; Value chain upgrade; Value chains; Technology transfer; finance; information and communication technology; low income population; technical change; technology transfer; China; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135708814

In practice, while the demand for some items conforms to standard probability distributions, the demand for others does not, thus making it challenging to estimate the CDF of lead-time demand. Distribution-free methods have been proposed, including resampling of demand from previous individual periods of the demand history, often referred to as bootstrapping in the inventory forecasting literature. There has been a lack of theoretical research on this form of resampling. In this paper, we analyse the bias and variance of CDF estimates obtained by resampling, both with and without replacement. Counterintuitively, we find that the ‘with replacement’ approach does not always dominate ‘without replacement’ in terms of mean square error of CDF estimates. Closed-form expressions are given for the components of Mean Square Error, with and without replacement. For shorter lead times, of two or three periods, these may be used directly to identify series that may benefit from resampling without replacement. Inventory performance implications are evaluated on simulated and empirical data. It is found that marked differences may arise between ‘with replacement’ and ‘without replacement’ bootstrapping approaches. The latter method can be more beneficial for lower target Cycle Service Levels, longer lead times and shorter demand histories. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bootstrapping; Demand distribution; Forecasting; Inventory; Resampling","Distribution functions; Forecasting; Bootstrapping; Cumulative distribution function; Demand distribution; Inventory; Inventory replenishment; Lead time demands; Leadtime; Means square errors; Resampling; Standard requirements; Mean square error",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135706328

The scope and complexity of rail projects make them particularly sensitive to problems arising from poor collaboration. Within projects, collaboration is a key enabler for effective decision-making and rework reduction, and this leads to time and cost savings. Strategies and technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) facilitate collaboration among project stakeholders during the asset delivery phase, but require a roadmap to ensure successful implementation. Using collaboration as a theoretical lens, and applying collaboration technologies, this paper conceptualized the collaboration processes for rail delivery with the focus on the design stage. The aim of this research was to develop a collaboration process model at the design stage of rail delivery. Ten in-depth interviews with BIM, GIS, and rail delivery experts were carried out to identify the dimensions and characteristics of the collaboration process model. The collaboration process emerging from the results was modeled using Integrated Definition (IDEF) notation, and revealed the project activities, key players' roles, and responsibilities for effective BIM-GIS-based collaboration in the design stage of rail projects. The process was operationalized by customizing a commercial common data environment platform and was validated using a focus group and an in-depth interview to establish the trustworthiness of the theoretically modeled collaboration process for rail delivery. The precise model of the collaboration process, based on integrated use of BIM and GIS, constitutes a significant original contribution of this research. This model should facilitate smoother implementation of these technologies, timely information flows between project participants, and ultimately more-effective delivery of rail projects. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Building Information Modeling (BIM); Collaboration; Geographic Information System (GIS); Integrated Definition (IDEF); Process model; Rail","Architectural design; Decision making; Information systems; Information theory; Information use; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Collaboration; Collaboration process; Design stage; Geographic information system; Integrated definition; Model informations; Process-models; Rail projects; Geographic information systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134893664

We investigate climate change adaptation technologies (CCATs) in US patents to understand (1) historical patterns and possible drivers of innovation; (2) scientific and technological requirements to develop and use CCATs; and (3) CCATs’ potential technological synergies with mitigation. First, in contrast to mitigation, innovation in CCATs only slowly takes off, indicating a relatively low awareness of investors for solutions to cope with climate risks. We discuss how historical trends in environmental regulation, energy prices, and public support may have contributed to patenting in CCATs. Second, CCATs form two main clusters: science-intensive ones in agriculture, health, and monitoring technologies; and engineering-intensive ones in coastal, water, and infrastructure technologies. Analyses of technology-specific scientific and technological knowledge bases inform directions for how to facilitate advancement, transfer and use of CCATs. Lastly, CCATs show strong technological complementarities with mitigation as more than 25% of CCATs bear mitigation benefits.

Because serious disruptions likely will escalate into organizational crises announced in the national news, managing the effects of the disruptions and communications with relevant stakeholders becomes critical to mitigating possible damages. One of the major stakeholders of a firm are the shareholders, and the current literature provides no direction regarding the strategies firms should deploy in communicating with shareholders. This study provides direction by examining effectiveness of organizational communication based upon the level of responsibility that a firm claims after a supply chain crisis is announced. An event study methodology (n = 204) was used to investigate the firm's communication and the associated shareholder reaction using abnormal stock returns as a proxy. The results of the study revealed that the less responsibility a firm accepted for the supply chain crisis, the less negative the abnormal stock return. From a short-term corporate financial perspective, it is attractive to assume less responsibility and even blame other firms. However, from a long-term supply chain perspective, more collaboration with buyers and suppliers is critical. The short-term abnormal stock returns could be weathered to assure more long-term collaboration. This research relies upon impression management communications as a theoretical foundation; whereby the results align with attribution theory.

In the decision-making process, experts often determine the importance weight of the criteria by comparing them to each other or with ideal solutions. With increasing criteria, the decision-making process becomes more complex, and the compatibility of judgments is reduced. Another problem is the inadequacy of criteria at different levels of the decision-making process. A high-level criterion can be considered, which includes several subcriteria. The subcriteria considered may not include all of the possible subcriteria because they could be unknown to decision-makers or could not be measured and used by decision-makers. Hence, the assumption that the importance weight of the subcriteria equals one (for example, in the analytic hierarchy process method) may not always be accurate. In this article, a new decision-making method is proposed based on Shapley's value that can extract the importance weight of criteria at different levels by considering the consistency between subcriteria.

We also include the firm's corporate reputation and explore its moderating influences on variables in the model. Data from 491 project managers indicate that one dynamic capability (relational) is three times stronger at predicting customer satisfaction than one of the ordinary capabilities (project).

Customer satisfaction is the strongest determinant of repurchase intentions and fully mediate the impact of the firm's dynamic and ordinary capabilities on repurchase intentions. When the sample is split according to corporate reputation, for the group who saw the focal firm reputation ranked first in industry, the project (ordinary) capabilities and relational (dynamic) capabilities have similar influences on satisfaction.

This study aims to fill this important gap and beyond. We derive a model of discontinuance intention (DI) where job satisfaction is a prominent mediator of the effect of reward fairness. We further theorize and test how and why on-demand workers’ dual commitments toward their online communities arising from workers’ informal social interactions (ISI) may create boundary conditions for the mediating role of job satisfaction. Data were collected from a large sample of 1493 on-demand workers over a four-year span and facilitated the analysis of a moderated mediation model. Results indicate that job satisfaction largely mediates a negative relationship between workers’ perceptions that their rewards are just (i.e., fairness of rewards) and their intention to discontinue work for the on-demand firm. Moreover, workers’ dual commitments toward their online peer communities (OPCs) disrupted this mediating effect. More interestingly, the dual commitments did not moderate the mediation path equally. Overall, our theoretical model and empirical results delineate how discontinuance intention can be affected by a parsimonious set of antecedents in the context of the on-demand economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Amazon Mechanical Turk; Discontinuance intention; Fairness of rewards; Gig economy; Job satisfaction; Moderated mediation; On-demand economy; Online community commitment","Economic and social effects; Online systems; Social networking (online); Amazon's mechanical turks; Discontinuance intention; Fairness of reward; Gig economy; Moderated mediation; On demands; On-demand economy; On-line communities; Online community commitment; Workers'; Job satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132532586

Decision makers are concerned not only with the current energy efficiency but also with the adjustment of energy mix. However, previous studies mostly focus on energy efficiency and seldom analyse energy mix adjustment. To fill in this literature gap, we address the research question: How to adjust the current energy mix to improve resource utilization and reduce emission? To answer this research question, based on portfolio theory, we first describe the return and risk of energy technologies and build the energy portfolio. Then, we propose a novel data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to measure the energy efficiency and adjust the energy mix. Furthermore, according to the method of improving the DEA frontier, we obtain the optimal energy mix adjustment plan. Moreover, we consider energy technical constraints caused by resource scarcity or geographical conditions while searching for the benchmark. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to the power industry. Interestingly, we find that after adjusting the energy mix, the proportion of renewable energies can be greatly increased and the carbon emission can be significantly reduced on the premise of not increasing other inputs. By our methods, the proportion of renewable energy can rise from 29.40% to 55.53%, and the proportion of coal can decrease from 64.59% to 26.15%. Meanwhile, the average carbon emission per unit of energy mixes can drop from 0.86kg/kWh to 0.65kg/kWh, which will reduce the carbon emissions of the power industry by 24.54%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy mix; Portfolio theory; Sustainable development","alternative energy; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; energy efficiency; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132435209

A generic metaheuristic design usually consists of three core elements that jointly determine the algorithm performance, including an initial candidate solution, a guided search procedure, and a fitness function that approximates the objective value. This paper proposes a data-driven metaheuristic (DDMH) framework that leverages the predictive power of machine learning models, which exploit location information and mine structural knowledge of a supply chain network for intelligent decision making. Specifically, the proposed framework offers three performance boosters, including an initial solution heuristic, a narrowed search space, and an efficient learning-based fitness function. The framework can be readily integrated into existing MHs. As a case study, we apply DDMH to a production/distribution network design problem. Experimental results show that the DDMH outperforms the traditional MHs with better solution quality and comparable running time, especially for hard problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fitness function; Initial solution; Machine learning; Metaheuristics; Network design; Search space","Decision making; Health; Heuristic algorithms; Supply chains; Data driven; Design problems; Fitness functions; Initial solution; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Network design; NP-hard; Production-distribution system design; Search spaces; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132231104

The study analyzes the time paths of the predicted impacts in a randomized trial providing financial incentives to bank agents (on the supply-side) and basic business training to women business owners (on the demand-side) to facilitate their access to and use of formal financial services. The trial took place over a two-year period in 401 villages in five regencies of East Java province, Indonesia. Although predicted impacts of the treatments are positive and increasing over time for seven of eight economic empowerment outcomes analyzed, their time paths vary, with business profits and household income increasing sharply in the second year after increasing very little during the first year while business capital, improved business practices, personal savings and women's agency increased linearly with time following treatment. A mediation analysis using a structural equations model finds significant direct and indirect effects between these economic empowerment-related outcomes: business practices, business capital and women's agency contribute directly to increased business profits while personal savings, business profits itself and household income are indirect drivers; further, both treatments had a strong direct impact on household income that was reinforced by the direct effects of increased business profits. The article's findings are consistent with other incipient evidence on the delayed effects of some interventions targeting women's economic empowerment. They underline the need to measure impacts over a sufficiently long period, which in this case is at least two years after exposure to the treatments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral economics-decision making and empowerment; Economics of gender; Entrepreneurship; Feminist economics; Field experiments","decision making; economic impact; empowerment; entrepreneur; experimental study; fieldwork; womens status; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131928104

Marcilio Dias – Jardim Paraíso, Apucarana86812-460, Brazil","This paper presents a decision support methodology to help increase public school education efficiency at the municipal/district/metropolitan level in Brazil. An important consideration for efficient use of resources in each school district or metropolitan area is the appropriate matching of the supply of human resources (e.g., teachers of specific subjects) and of infrastructure resources (e.g., school locations, classroom availability) with demand (students requesting enrollment in each grade). This resource matching is a necessary periodic (perhaps annual) district level planning task that precedes individual school operational tasks such as registration, timetabling, and other scheduling. This paper describes a mathematical model and computational tool to optimize the allocation efficiency of public school district resources during the long-term strategic planning stage as well as the shorter-term tactical planning stage preceding each academic year, i.e., the stage bridging strategic planning and operational programming. This problem, namely the simultaneous optimization of demand variables (students) and both infrastructure and human capital supply variables (respectively classroom availability and teacher specializations) in the form of student/school/class/teacher/classroom matchings for a given physical plant, was solved through a mixed integer linear programming formulation that endogenously incorporates those supply variables with student demand variables. The paper presents the conceptual framework, provides the mathematical formulation, and describes the implementation of the resulting decision support computational system. The paper also illustrates the suggested methodology by examining public schooling in Itacoatiara, a municipality on the banks of the Amazon River in a resource-constrained and low-HDI region of Brazil, before a new school was added to the local network in 2019. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Decision support systems; Developing countries; Efficient resource allocation; Public education; School efficiency","allocative efficiency; decision support system; developing world; education; human capital; human resource; linear programing; numerical model; public administration; public spending; resource allocation; strategic approach; urban planning; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Itacoatiara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130433199

Using longitudinal data from a restaurant chain, we find that those managers who persistently create more value for the firm capture just 0.5% of that extra value through their pay. We explore the reasons for this limited managerial value capture using an abductive approach. We find some evidence that value capture may be limited by lack of alternative employment opportunities. More extensive evidence suggests that the employer often struggled to identify individual contributions to value creation, limiting managerial rewards. We discuss the theoretical implications of such limited managerial value capture for the strategic human capital literature. Managerial Summary: Frontline managers can differ in how much they contribute to firm profitability. Do those managers who contribute the most to firm performance also capture those benefits back through higher pay? In a study of restaurant managers, we find that managers differ substantially in the profits that they create, but that the most profitable managers only capture 0.5% of the extra profits they create. We also find evidence that the firm often fails to identify which managers are the most persistently profitable, potentially reducing the rewards paid to those managers.

According to literature, the fear (or lack of fear) of labor-market competition between natives and migrants may shape attitudes, especially those of low-skilled workers. In this comprehensive framework, we contribute to the literature by looking into a new aspect that shapes attitudes toward migration: urbanization. Employing data from round 1 to round 9 of the European Social Survey covering the time span 2002–2018, this paper analyzes the trend of attitudes toward migration, focusing on the effects of urbanization as a direct determinant of attitudes toward migration as a moderator of education. Urbanization typically affects attitudes toward migrants both directly and indirectly, interacting with individuals' education, which is used to distinguish high-skilled and low-skilled workers. Results support the hypothesis that people living in the rural areas display more negative attitudes toward migration, and this effect is more substantial for low-skilled workers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes; Education; Europe; Migration; Urbanization","attitudinal survey; decision making; education; migrants experience; urbanization; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126585226

Most recently, this research has focused on understanding sources of variance in the distinctiveness–performance relationship. We extend this literature with an examination of digital products and argue that the relationship depends on products' revenue models: We theorize the relationship is inverted U-shaped for paid products but U-shaped for free products, owing to heightened privacy concerns of free product customers. We further argue that this latter relationship becomes flatter for free products that provide greater monetization transparency by publishing a privacy statement or adopting a freemium revenue approach. Hypotheses are tested using a sample of 250,000-plus Apple App Store apps. Managerial Summary: How should firms in the digital space position their products for optimal performance? We study this question in the Apple App Store, and suggest that the optimal positioning of digital products depends on their revenue model. Paid products should be moderately differentiated from competing products. By contrast, free products benefit most from very low or very high levels of differentiation. We attribute the different performance effects of differentiation to customers' privacy concerns over free products. Firms can partially ameliorate those privacy concerns by providing greater monetization transparency by publishing a privacy statement or by adopting a freemium revenue approach, making moderate levels of differentiation more viable. Our findings help managers align choices of positioning and revenue model, two critical aspects of the firm's business model. © 2022 The Authors.

However, for certain types of plastics, the recycling process is economically unviable. Government-driven incentives, such as a policy imposing a minimum fraction of recycled plastics to be used in production processes of plastic goods, offer an exit from this impasse. In this paper, we study how a firm’s investment behavior is affected by policy uncertainty governing the introduction of such a regulatory measure. Specifically, we adopt a real option approach to study the two-step investment of a firm in its transition to the use of recycled plastics. A clear trade-off can be distinguished. On the one hand, investing early causes unnecessary profit losses before the policy implementation. On the other hand, a lack of investment leads to market exclusion after the policy implementation. For our case study on the use of recycled polyethylene, we find that firms plan their first investment step, so that the timing of the second investment step approximates their projection on the policy implementation time. Moreover, we find that the firm’s value is maximized when the capacity of the first investment is smaller than the capacity of the second investment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Circular economy; Policy uncertainty; Public pressure; Real option analysis; Recycled plastics; Stepwise investment","Economic and social effects; Economics; Elastomers; Plastic recycling; Polyethylenes; Uncertainty analysis; Circular economy; Policy implementations; Policy uncertainty; Production process; Public pressures; Real options analysis; Recycled plastics; Recycling process; Stepwise investment; Uncertainty; Investments; investment; plastic; policy implementation; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118552915

We develop a numerical model which resolves hourly dispatch and investment choices among heterogeneous energy technologies and natural resources in interconnected wholesale electricity markets, cross-country trade (spatial flexibility), energy storage (temporal flexibility), and tradable green quotas (regulatory flexibility). Taking the model to the data for the case of Europe’s system of interconnected electricity markets, we find that the appropriate combination of flexibility can bring about substantial gains in economic efficiency, reduce costs (up to 13.8%) and lower CO2 emissions (up to 51.2%). Regulatory flexibility is necessary to realize most of the maximum possible benefits. We also find that gains from increased flexibility are unevenly distributed and that some countries incur welfare losses. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"Costs; Digital storage; Economic efficiency; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Investments; Power markets; CO 2 emission; Economic costs; Economic efficiency; Energy markets; Energy technologies; Green energy; Renewable energies; S-systems; Spacetime; Wholesale electricity markets; Carbon dioxide; alternative energy; electricity; energy market; investment; numerical model; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116149487

In this article we advocate a forward-looking, ambitious and disruptive smart cloud commuting system (SCCS) for future smart cities based on shared AVs. Employing giant pools of AVs of varying sizes, SCCS seeks to supplant and integrate various modes of transport - most of personal vehicles, low ridership public buses, and taxis used in today's private and public transport systems - in a unified, on-demand fashion, and provides passengers with a fast, convenient, and low cost transport service for their daily commuting needs. To explore feasibility and efficiency gains of the proposed SCCS, we model SCCS as a queueing system with passengers' trip demands (as jobs) being served by the AVs (as servers). Using a 1-year real trip dataset from Shenzhen China, we quantify (i) how design choices, such as the numbers of depots and AVs, affect the passenger waiting time and vehicle utilization; and (ii) how much efficiency gains (i.e., reducing the number of service vehicles, and improving the vehicle utilization) can be obtained by SCCS comparing to the current taxi system. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SCCS framework can serve the trip demands with 22 percent fewer vehicles and 37 percent more vehicle utilization, which shed lights on the design feasibility of future smart transportation systems. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud commuting; queuing theory; urban computing","Distributed computer systems; Efficiency; Smart city; Taxicabs; Autonomous Vehicles; Cloud-computing; Efficiency gain; Forward looking; Mode of transport; On demands; Public transportation; Road; Trip demand; Vehicle utilization; Autonomous vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097422906

First, the study aims to examine the direct effect of illicit financial flows (IFF) and quality of governance (QoG) on economic growth. Second, this study seeks to examine the moderating effect of QoG on the economic consequences of IFF. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected data from nine The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries for the period of 10 years from 2008 to 2019. The study concerned an analysis of the testing of a conceptual framework which based on secondary data which may lack a comprehensive substantiation on the grounds of measurement theory. A partial least squares (PLS) modelling using the SmartPLS 3.2.8 version was used as a statistical tool to examine the measurement and structural model. Findings: Key findings provide empirical support on the effect of IFF and QoG on economic growth. It also confirmed that QoG significantly moderated the relationship between IFF and economic growth by reducing the negative impact of IFF on economic growth. Practical implications: Immediate corrective action needs to be implemented by policymakers of ASEAN countries to strengthen QoG to effectively curb IFF activities.

This study focuses on the DR participation strategy in terms of aggregators who offer appropriate DR programs to customers with flexible loads. DR aggregators engage in the electricity market according to customer behavior and must make decisions that increase the profits of both DR aggregators and customers. Customers use the DR program model, which sends its demand reduction capabilities to a DR aggregator that bids aggregate demand reduction to the electricity market. DR aggregators not only determine the optimal rate of incentives to present to the customers but can also serve customers and formulate an optimal energy storage system (ESS) operation to reduce their demands. This study formalized the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and used the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. In the RL framework, the DR aggregator and each customer are allocated to each agent, and the agents interact with the environment and are trained to make an optimal decision. The proposed method was validated using actual industrial and commercial customer demand profiles and market price profiles in South Korea. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method could optimize decisions from the perspective of the DR aggregator.

Little research has been conducted in this group about their experiences of occupational stress. The authors explored how stress was experienced and managed by construction professionals and its perceived impact on health. Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 32 construction professionals in a British construction company, with varying levels of seniority and years in the industry. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed thematically. Findings: Stress was viewed an inevitable and increasing part of the construction industry, exacerbated by recent economic challenges. Participants talked about a culture of stress and overwork but often felt unable to challenge it due to job insecurity. Senior management acknowledged stress was a problem within the industry and something that potentially threatened company productivity. Company-wide initiatives had been implemented to address stress levels (e.g. Mental Health First Aiders), but were criticised for ignoring underlying issues. Informal means of managing stress were identified, such as careful consideration of team dynamics, which allowed employees to form close bonds and using “banter” and camaraderie to relieve stress. However, the persistence of a macho male image meant some participants were reluctant to talk about their feelings at work. Participants described individual coping strategies, such as exercise, but these were hard to prioritise in challenging times. Originality/value: There is growing recognition that health and well-being must be given greater priority in the construction industry. Industry pressures and competitive practices undermine efforts to improve staff well-being. Action must be taken at senior levels to address this conflict, while building on existing informal mechanisms of support and stress relief. © 2022, Paige M. Hulls, Frank de Vocht, Richard M.

With the BPSM model, we complement recent research that involves only investors’ sentiments by also considering market sentiments to model investors’ portfolio rebalancing behavior. Market sentiments are obtained by analyzing the online information through deep learning text analysis algorithms based on the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model. The stochastic neural networks-based algorithm is designed to solve the BPSM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the BPSM model on the Shanghai 50 and Hushen 300 data sets. The frame of experiments includes a dynamic portfolio rebalancing model, in which both the investors’ sentiments and the market sentiments are modeled to analyze investors’ dynamic portfolio rebalancing behavior. The experiment results show that, first, by updating the expected return rate of each period according to investors’ sentiments and market sentiments, in all cases, the BPSM model achieves a higher investment return per unit risk (Rpr) than the conventional Mean–variance (MV) model to minimize investment risk. Second, compared with the two baseline models that include only investors’ sentiments, the BPSM realizes a portfolio policy that improves investment return per unit risk (Rpr) in 70% of situations. These results reveal that incorporating investors’ behavior-related signals into the portfolio selection model is beneficial to investors’ investment results, which offers implications for financial stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior-related decisions; Dynamic rebalancing rule; Sparse portfolio optimization","Commerce; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Long short-term memory; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Behavior-related decision; Dynamic portfolios; Dynamic rebalancing rule; Investment returns; Investor's sentiments; Per unit; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection models; Rebalancing; Sparse portfolio optimization; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132732666

As prior research on default risk evaluation in online lending largely focuses on the micro listing level, we advocate a new research problem at the macro platform level, platform risk evaluation, and explore types of information and methods that are effective in predicting platform risk. We identify four types of information, that is, platform characteristic, risk management, commercial competition, and online word of mouth, by categorizing the available features based on the aspects they reflect and examine their utilities, separately and jointly, in predicting platform risk. We also propose the use of survival analysis, especially the mixture survival model, in predicting whether and when a platform will default. Considering the essential causes and characteristics of different default events, we differentiate two types of default platforms, namely, problematic and failed platforms, and accommodate them using competing risk analysis. We carry out a cross-stage analysis using data crawled from two leading web portals for online lending in China with the two stages separated by the recent dramatic policy intervention. Our results demonstrate the competitive predictive ability of survival analysis as compared with classification-based models. The results also reveal the differences among the four identified factors in terms of predictive utility, the heterogeneity between the two types of default platforms, and differences between the start-up and stable periods of platform development. Additionally, we identify some key features using Shapley values and examine the effects of these key features. Based on the results, we derive some insights and examine the cross-stage changes and commonalities. We provide both lessons learned from the past and practical implications for market managers and lenders in the current online lending market. © 2021 INFORMS.","cross-stage analysis; default prediction; fintech; mixture survival model; online lending; platform risk","Bioinformatics; Commerce; Investments; Mixtures; Portals; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Cross-stage analyse; Default prediction; Key feature; Mixture survival model; Online lending; Platform risk; Risk evaluation; Stage analysis; Survival analysis; Survival model; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140217512

To that end, investments in renewable energy and balancing renewable supply and energy demand on the larger scale are crucial. One mechanism to create price signals for demand balancing, as well as for consumer engagement, is to establish trading platforms (or peer-to-peer (P2P) markets) through which households can directly buy and sell renewable energy. However, residential consumers are typically lay users with little or no previous exposure to the complexity and the dynamics involved in energy markets. More so, empirical research on consumer engagement in the energy sector indicates that individuals tend to act against their stated proenvironmental intentions and to lose interest in energy management systems particularly quickly - calling into question regulatory efforts to foster P2P markets to push the transition to renewable energy. We have implemented the first empirical study worldwide that analyzes bidding behavior in a real-world P2P energy market, in which users bid for solar energy via an auction mechanism. For the duration of an entire year, users could interact with the market using a web app. The prices settled on the P2P market directly impacted participants' electricity bills. We provide unique empirical evidence showing that (1) participants were willing to engage in energy trading and that (2) they understood the market mechanism surprisingly well and exhibited learning effects. Still, bidding behavior did not reflect their stated intention of paying a price premium for local solar energy.

Whereas work on multitasking suggests that TV consumption may lead to lower online sales, research in the area of impulse buying suggests the opposite. In this paper, we study the impact of concurrent TV consumption on online shopping behavior and try to understand this conflict. Our first study analyzes the impact of TV consumption on online shopping behavior at the aggregate level using a panel of 100,000 U.S. customers over a period of 24 months. We address potential endogeneity problems with an instrumental variable approach. Our second study proposes a novel approach to realizing individual-level analysis over thousands of consumers and products. Examining massive amounts of data, we identify a sample of consumers who watched a certain TV show and who were simultaneously doing online shopping at Amazon.com. We then compare their shopping behavior on the day of the TV show to their shopping behavior one week prior. Both studies reveal that whereas TV consumption is correlated with a higher likelihood of online shopping in general, the causal effect of TV watching differs with respect to the complexity of the products purchased. If a TV program appeals to a large TV audience, then this results in fewer immediate sales of highcomplexity products (1% increase in TV consumption leads to -2.2% sales) and more sales of low-complexity products (1% increase in TV consumption leads to +8.8% sales).

Experimentation leads to organizational learning, which drives improvements in firm performance. We investigate this proposition by exploiting the time-varying adoption of A/B testing technology, which has drastically reduced the cost of testing business ideas. Our results provide the first evidence on how digital experimentation affects a large sample of high-technology start-ups using data that tracks their growth, technology use, and products. We find that, although relatively few firms adopt A/B testing, among those that do, performance improves by 30%–100% after a year of use. We then argue that this substantial effect and relatively low adoption rate arises because start-ups do not only test one-off incremental changes, but also use A/B testing as part of a broader strategy of experimentation. Qualitative insights and additional quantitative analyses show that experimentation improves organizational learning, which helps start-ups develop more new products, identify and scale promising ideas, and fail faster when they receive negative signals. These findings inform the literatures on entrepreneurial strategy, organizational learning, and data-driven decision making.

Using operational and survey data from a call center with a pooled queue structure and limited financial incentives, we examine how individual differences between servers’ trait intrinsic motivation (IM) and extrinsic motivation (EM) impact their average offline, online, and total service times in response to changing workloads. We find significant differences in the patterns of workload and service time relationships across different stages of the service request between servers possessing different combinations of trait motivation. For example, servers with a combination of high IM and low EM were approximately 15% (161%) faster in processing the offline portion of service requests than their peers with the opposite combination (low and high) when workload levels were low (high), respectively. In contrast, servers with high IM-low EM were approximately 35% (5%) slower in processing the online portion of service requests than their low IM-high EM counterparts when workload levels were low (high), respectively. Our findings suggest important nuances in how servers with different trait motivation types respond to changing workload across different stages of the service request. The behavioral pattern shown by high IM-low EM servers is consistent with the preferences of productivity-seeking call center managers who favor speedup and slowdown at certain stages of the service request, conditional to workload. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for trait-based individual differences for a more complete understanding of the complex relationship between workload and service time. © 2022 INFORMS.","behavioral operations; call center operations; motivation; productivity; workload","Motivation; Quality of service; Behavioral operations; Call center operation; Call centers; Extrinsic motivation; Individual Differences; Intrinsic motivation; Offline; Service requests; Service time; Workload; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139085853

Yet, these protocols do not consider many factors, including the spatial variation in population density, the stroke’s severity, the time since stroke onset, and the congestion level at the receiving stroke center. We develop an analytical framework that enriches the stroke transport decision-making process by incorporating these factors. Our research contributes to the literature of stroke care systems by (i) developing the first analytical framework to determine the optimal primary hospital destination in a regional stroke network and (ii) comparing the impact of incorporating prehospital triaging on health outcomes. To this end, we develop an efficient reformulation for allocation problems with stochastic demand and multiserver system under congestion. We derive data-driven outcome prediction models embedded in mixed integer second-order cone programming formulation. Our framework is applied to two real-life cases: Montreal and Quebec City Stroke Networks. We show that adopting a triage strategy could lead to significantly improved health outcomes, where the magnitude of these improvements varies with the networks’ sizes and congestion levels. In the Montreal case, our proposed policy may increase the ratio of patients for therapeutic intervention eligibility by 12.5% while improving by 69% the number of patients with more than two days of emergency department boarding delays. Our results reveal that it is important to consider the network’s characteristics in making a decision for or against implementing a prehospital triage strategy. Finally, we propose a heuristic policy that provides a promising performance while also being easy to implement. © 2022 INFORMS.","allocation problem; congestion; stochastic demand; stroke; transfer protocols","Decision making; Hospitals; Integer programming; Patient treatment; Population statistics; Stochastic systems; Allocation problems; Congestion; Congestion level; Health outcomes; Patient transfer; Specific protocol; Stochastic-demand; Stroke; Stroke patients; Transfer protocol; Second-order cone programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139081688

Using data on about 50,000 license deals over more than 10 years, we identify the effects of digitization from quasi-experimental variation across book types. Consistent with digitization generating additional information for predicting product appeal, we show that the size of license payments more accurately reflects a product’s ex post success, and more so for publishers that invest more in data analytics. These effects cannot be fully explained by changes in bargaining power or in demand. We estimate that efficiency gains are worth between 10% and 18% of publishers’ total investments in book deals. Thus, digitization can have large impacts on the allocation of resources across products of varying qualities in markets in which product appeal has traditionally been difficult to predict ex ante. © 2022 INFORMS.","book publishing; digitization; licensing markets; prediction","Commerce; Data Analytics; Efficiency; Investments; Book publishing; Data analytics; Digitisation; Efficiency gain; Ex antes; Licensing market; Market efficiency; Power; Total investment; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139049887

Multiple cases exist where firms have attempted to resume the development of an innovative product or service after previously suspending or abandoning it prior to completion. Research on this important innovation recycling activity is surprisingly scarce, despite its critical role in mitigating risk in the context of high environmental uncertainty. We draw our inferences from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where innovation resources are relatively limited and environmental uncertainty and institutional voids prevail, a context that encourages the use of innovation recycling. This study examines how innovation recycling influences a firm's innovation ability and the moderating impact of innovation sourcing modes using a knowledge-based view of the firm and arguments from transaction cost economics. We retrieved data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey and the Innovation Follow-up Survey of 1076 firms located in eight SSA countries (Ghana, Malawi, Namibia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) spanning from 2011 to 2014 to test our conceptual model. Our findings show that (1) innovation recycling has a positive influence on a firm's innovation ability and (2) this relationship is moderated by different innovation sourcing modes. These findings enrich the theory and imply that firms operating in developing countries need to develop innovation recycling by focusing on sourcing knowledge within, rather than across, firm boundaries. © 2022 The Authors.

To this end, by applying a sample dataset of 47 countries for the period 1996–2018, this study empirically examines the financial risk-green growth nexus, and also checks their regional heterogeneity as well as the impact of the financial crisis. We find that: (i) increased financial risks play an important role in restricting green growth across the globe; by implication, the instability of financial markets is an effective determinant hindering the global green evolution; (ii) significant regional heterogeneity exists in the financial risk-green growth nexus; only in regions with low green growth and high financial risks can financial risks affect green growth negatively; and (iii) the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 becomes a watershed in the impact of financial risks on green growth; after the crisis, the effective control of financial risks can facilitate the green economic recovery. Accordingly, some policy implications are put forward concerning the reform of the financial system and the establishment of early warning mechanism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Financial risks; Globe; Green growth; Heterogeneous and asymmetric analysis; SYS-GMM technique","Finance; Risk assessment; Economic recovery; Financial crisis; Financial industry; Financial risks; Globe; Green growths; Heterogeneous and asymmetric analyse; Policy implications; Sample dataset; SYS-GMM technique; Public policy; data set; economic growth; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; heterogeneity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136142757

The magnitude of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) and the geopolitical risk (GPR) increases significantly during extreme crisis periods such as covid crisis, but the earlier literature ignores how both risk measures impact on different asset classes during severe economic downturns. In this paper, we contribute by examining the hedging and safe-haven properties of gold, oil, equities, and foreign exchange rates against the United States (US) EPU and GPR by utilizing OLS regression, quantile regression and the quantile connectedness approach for pre-covid (October 1, 2013–March 10, 2020) and post-covid data (March 11, 2020–August 27, 2021). OLS results suggest that only the stock market has positive risk premium for both uncertainty measures. With quantile regression analysis for the pre-covid period, we find that asset returns provide no hedge (hedge) across bearish (bullish) market conditions. Importantly, safe-haven properties suggest that gold is a safe-haven asset at the extreme stress condition (at higher level of USEPU shocks). Other assets also exhibit safe-haven characteristics during extreme uncertain periods with heterogeneity in safe-haven effectiveness across bearish to bullish markets. With the post-covid data, we show that S&P500 stocks and EURO hedge EPU and GPR in bullish market condition, while Oil, S&P500, Great Britain Pound, EURO, Japanese Yen display safe-haven properties at the 99% quantile of USEPU. Specifically, gold lost its safe-haven features during covid. Interestingly, results from quantile connectedness suggest that selected asset returns have the potential to diversify against uncertainty measures considering low volatility transmissions between them across the lower and higher quantiles. Our findings are important for investors and asset managers who aim to hedge EPU and GPR during the stress period. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","EPU; Foreign exchange rates; Gold; GPR; Hedge; Oil; Safe-haven asset; Stocks","Commerce; Financial markets; Gold; Investments; Planning; Public policy; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Wooden fences; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty index; Foreign exchange rates; Geopolitical risks; Gold; Hedge; Oil; Safe-haven asset; Stock; Uncertainty; Regression analysis; COVID-19; currency; economic policy; exchange rate; geopolitics; gold; oil supply; regression analysis; stock market; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135957512

Exacerbated population growth triggers an emphasis on better resource management strategies addressing the balance of supply and demand over food, energy, and water sectors while considering social and economic development. Promoting sustainable development goals requires governance structures and functions within and across the food, energy, and water sectors, specifically due to polycentric urban development. This study emphasizes food security via an urban agriculture network in the greater Miami metropolitan area, encompassing the three counties of Palm-Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade. Given the existing governance structure, we quantified several sustainability indices for clustering analysis to agglomerate urban agricultural sites (UASs) and to help identify the priority of clusters in terms of vulnerability or risk level according to their priority index in multicriteria decision-making. The cases of eight clusters were selected for the visualization of the UASs ranked by multicriteria decision-making based on scenarios prioritized for governance under the impacts of climate change, social equity, and economic development.

In response, the current study analyzed 30 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2017. Specifically, this study focuses on examining the nexus of natural resources volatility (TNRT), economic performance (GDP), investment in energy resources (IER), foreign trade (FT), and technology innovation (TI). Since the variables follow irregular distribution, this study uses the novel movement quantile regression approach method, which efficiently deals with data's abnormality and provides estimates at a specific location, scale, and quantile and is more robust than the traditional approaches. This study restricts the influence of explanatory variables up to four quantiles, i.e., Q0.25, Q0.50, Q0.75, and Q0.90. Empirical findings reveal that GDP, FT, and TI positively influence TNRT, indicating that these variables are favorable factors of natural resource volatility. Still, the influence and magnitude of GDP and FT are reducing from lower to higher quantile. In contrast, IER influences TNRT, reducing magnitude from lower to higher quantile and becoming insignificant in Q0.90. This indicates that investment in IER could reduce natural resource volatility. Moreover, unidirectional causality is reported running from FT to TNRT. At the same time, the feedback effect is validated for the rest of the explanatory variables and TNRT. Since this study focuses on provincial data, the results could be generalized to provincial authorities rather than the central authorities and could help construct relevant policies to resolve the issue. This study recommends rapid economic growth, enhancement of investment in energy resources, and adoption of innovative technology to reduce volatility in natural resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic performance; Foreign trade; Natural resources; Quantile regression; Volatility","Economic analysis; Energy resources; Investments; Natural resources; Economic performance; Economic research; Explanatory variables; Foreign technology; High quantile; Low-to-high; Policy level; Quantile regression; Recent trends; Volatility; International trade; economic growth; energy resource; international trade; investment; natural resource; regression analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135893385

Industrial vulnerability is a crucial component of mineral commodity criticality tools as it provides guidance on the economic importance of these commodities to regional criticality indices. Using an economic model that links mineral commodity end-use data to input-output tables and a linear optimization routine, reductions in economic output of individual industries and of the overall economy may be calculated. Such a model can also help to identify industries, be they direct or indirect consumers of the mineral commodities in question, that are most vulnerable to specific mineral commodity supply disruptions at different disruption magnitudes. In this assessment, 56 commodities’ end-use data for the year 2012 were paired with the United States’ detail-level Benchmark Input-Output accounts to build an industrial vulnerability model. The model does not evaluate the likelihood of specific supply disruptions but can be used to assess potential industry impacts for a range of scenarios. The model findings indicate that when the supplies of mineral commodities such as mica, lithium, and fluorspar were disrupted, large overall economic decline was paired with a large decline in many industries. On the other hand, gold, lead, and rhenium disruptions resulted in low declines and few disrupted industries.

This paper investigates the impact of anti-counterfeiting in a retail platform and the incentives for the platform and the manufacturer to invest in anti-counterfeiting technology by using a game-theoretic model. We consider that the product can be sold directly by the manufacturer, or indirectly through a reseller on the platform. The reseller might also sell fake products, but the platform and the manufacturer can use anti-counterfeiting technology to fight against the fakes. Our analysis shows that the payoff of anti-counterfeiting in the retail platform is not always positive. Specifically, when the production valuation is low, the anti-counterfeiting payoff for the platform (the manufacturer) is negative if the proportion of fakes is sufficiently low (high). We also find that anti-counterfeiting may harm consumer surplus and social welfare. In addition, if the investment cost of anti-counterfeiting is high, at most one firm, either the platform or the manufacturer, has the incentive to invest in anti-counterfeiting contingent on the relative valuation on the platform's services. Finally, with the investment in anti-counterfeiting, the platform should provide better services than before for surviving in the market. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-counterfeiting; Dual channel; Game theory; Platform economics; Retail management","game theory; incentive; numerical model; retailing; technological development; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135582900

In this study, we analyse the feasibility of hedging and diversifying stocks with carbon futures. We adopt the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models which allow us to compute time-varying optimal hedge ratios, optimal weights and portfolio returns. These hedging and portfolio metrics are then compared with those derived for commodity futures. Our main results suggest that including a small portion of carbon futures in a stock portfolio provides hedging benefits and reduces overall risk for a given level of expected return. The COVID-19 outbreak seems to have changed the hedging dynamics and the hedging capability of carbon futures is impaired during the pandemic. In terms of diversification benefits, our results show that adding carbon to a stock portfolio improves the risk-adjusted performance overall. We further examine economic benefits as a measure of hedging performance and find evidence of positive utility gains that are strongly dependent on investors' risk aversion. Comparing the performance of carbon futures with commodities, hedging effectiveness of carbon futures is not as high as that of precious metals and agriculture futures, however, carbon credits outperform energy futures in terms of hedging and diversification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon futures; Diversification; Hedging; Stock returns","Economics; Financial markets; Investments; Risk assessment; Carbon credits; Carbon future; Diversification; Downside risks; Dynamic conditional correlations; Hedging; Performance; Potential benefits; Stock portfolio; Stock returns; Carbon; carbon emission; COVID-19; environmental policy; feasibility study; pandemic; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135414914

The interrelation between oil price uncertainty and investment-q sensitivity is more remarkable for firms with uncorrelated product demand with that of their peers, stronger CEO concern, and greater CEO equity incentives. Furthermore, we provide evidence that oil price uncertainty can enhance investment-q sensitivity, especially for firms in highly oil-intensive industries and non-oil-producing states.

The progress of digitalization has been uneven, as has been the recognition of the new security environment in which the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry operates. Hackers for profit, disloyal competitors, disgruntled insiders, or even state agents employing hybrid warfare all utilize cyber means to achieve goals that can disrupt processes, corrupt information, interrupt operations, and cause significant material damage or even loss of human life. Starting from recognizing the paucity of studies in this field, this paper analyzes the results from a survey on cybersecurity awareness in the AECO industry. The analyses employed statistical methods such as t-test, Spearman's rank correlation test, and ANOVA to test the hypotheses formulated to answer the research questions of the study. The resulting data are commented upon and placed in the context of an evolving industry confronted with the shock of the new security environment, while also moving forward on Construction 4.0 as a creator of added value, new efficiencies, and new capabilities. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.","Awareness; Construction 4.0; Cybersecurity; Survey","Construction industry; Cybersecurity; Life cycle; Personal computing; Architecture engineering; Awareness; Construction 4.0; Construction projects; Cyber security; Digital technologies; Engineering constructions; Engineering operation; Industry surveys; Security environments; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134373897

Survey data commonly are used in empirical CEM studies. However, the use of such data in empirical analysis is susceptible to common method bias (CMB) issues, which can generate false correlations between dependent and explanatory variables, leading to spurious and unreliable results. To facilitate recent discussion about the rigorous application of research methodologies in CEM research, we provide a comprehensive overview of major CMB sources and examine articles published in the last 5 years to identify potential CMB issues in the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management. We found that approximately 90% of articles that used survey data in the empirical analysis were likely to be affected by CMB. The major source is the common rater effect, followed by the item characteristics effect and the measurement context effect. Because only a handful of studies tested or controlled for CMB, we propose effective and targeted ex ante procedural controls and ex post statistical controls to mitigate its negative impact. This study sheds light on an important and pervasive methodological issue in empirical CEM studies, and provides guidelines for improving the reliability of future empirical research in the CEM field. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Common method bias (CMB); Construction engineering and management (CEM); Methodological rigor; Procedural control; Statistical control","Computational electromagnetics; Statistical methods; Common method bias; Construction engineering; Construction engineering and management; Construction management; Empirical research; Management research; Methodological rigor; Procedural control; Statistical control; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134190804

A Basic Process Control System (BPCS) is combined with a Safety-Instrumented System (SIS) in a physically integrated form factor using shared resources of some kind. This paper suggests such a strategic choice of technology can result in functional safety (FS) hazards or security vulnerabilities, giving rise to resilience concerns. It takes a sceptical view of such an approach and instead proposes strict segregation of such functions and resources. In the context of critical national infrastructure (CNI), where potentially high consequence events (HCE) may arise from unplanned incidents, the outcome of this paper is to warn against the use of such architecture - even beyond that arena. Both ancient and modern, yet similarly strategic, historical decisions are used as metaphors to illustrate how sometimes insufficiently scrutinised technologies can be later regretted. Practical technical, organisational, and cultural measures are offered to steer against the headwind of commercial pressures in promoting integrated FS and security of the BPCS-SIS environment.

A dynamic multi-sector model is constructed to assess the growth effects of this extraordinary investment episode. The model features sectoral heterogeneity in infrastructure intensity and positive externalities from aggregate infrastructure for firms and consumers. Along the model's transition path, infrastructure investment interacts with labor-augmenting technological progress and structural change in China to generate growth. The benchmark results suggest that infrastructure expansion accounts for 14% of China's average annual growth rate over the period 2003–2016, but the expansion was socially excessive for nearly the entire period.

However, there is still a clear lack of empirical work on how social entrepreneurial employees within an organization and specific decision characteristics of top management they work under may influence innovation performance. This study aims to contribute to the above issues by adopting a meso-to-micro approach to investigating how top management team (TMT) decision creativity and speed influence the effects of employee social entrepreneurship orientation (eSEO) on firms' product innovation performance. To reveal the dynamics of eSEO over-time, we adopted a longitudinal research design to collect data from 2567 employees, one TMT member, and one new product development manager from each of the 206 social enterprises, with a secondary proxy dataset to triangulate the primary data. Our results show that high TMT decision creativity helps social enterprises leverage eSEO to enhance product innovation performance, while high TMT decision speed fails to produce the same effect. When high TMT decision creativity is coupled with low TMT decision speed, the contribution of eSEO to product innovation is at its largest. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Decision creativity; Decision speed; Employee social entrepreneurship orientation; Product innovation; Top management team","Economic and social effects; Human resource management; Product design; Product development; Decision creativity; Decision speed; Employee social entrepreneurship orientation; Firm Performance; Innovation performance; Product innovation; Social enterprise; Social entrepreneurship; Team decision; Top management teams; Decision making; decision making; entrepreneur; innovation; product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133738552

Intuition is often thought of as a single construct, but our 2-year longitudinal study of multiple managers developing opportunities uncovered four distinct types of intuition: expert intuition, based on previous experience; creative intuition, based on a sense of direction for a novel solution; social intuition, based on a sense of interpersonal relationships; and temporal intuition, based on a sense of the timing being right to create or capture an opportunity. We offer a range of recommendations regarding the strengths and limitations of each type of intuition.

The new situation, where decision-makers strive to promptly respond to the unprecedented crisis to sustain essential construction operations without compromising the safety and health of workers, implies the presence of an availability heuristic. An availability heuristic has the potential to bring unconscious, systematic errors to the decision-making process. This study creates a decision-making experiment to empirically examine the presence of an availability heuristic and the effectiveness of a corresponding mitigation strategy in construction workforce decision-making under COVID-19 uncertainties. The experiment was conducted among students in the construction program from April 2021 to May 2021. Results show that students tend to support the management improvement ideas that fall into their most familiar fields. Providing information on other options against the option with the easiest recalled instances has been proven effective in terms of reducing the presence of the heuristic. Moreover, the results show that the presence of the heuristic is robust and unspecific to the level of education and years of work experience. The primary contributions of this research are (1) identifying the presence of the availability heuristic in construction workforce decision-making under COVID-19 uncertainties, (2) testing the effectiveness of a mitigation strategy against the availability heuristic, (3) bridging the rational decision-making with actual choices, (4) introducing the approach of decision-making experiments for future studies in construction engineering and management (CEM), and (5) suggesting an integrated perspective taking advantage of both positivism and constructivism for CEM decision-making. It is anticipated that policy makers can benefit from this study by enhancing the understanding of construction workforce decision-making amid a pandemic. This enhanced understanding can help to design effective strategies to promote the normal operation of the essential construction industry and ensure the safety and health of approximately 7.6 million employees in the construction industry during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises in the future. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Accident prevention; Construction industry; COVID-19; Systematic errors; Construction engineering; Construction management; Construction operations; Construction workforces; Coronaviruses; Decision makers; Decisions makings; Mitigation strategy; Safety and healths; Uncertainty; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133502348

These computational models are designed to discover useful patterns from large amounts of data, which augment human capabilities to make decisions in various application domains. However, there are growing concerns regarding the ethics challenges faced by these automated decision-making (ADM) models, most notably on the issue of algorithmic bias, in which the models systematically produce less favorable (i.e., unfair) decisions for certain groups of people. In this commentary, we argue that algorithmic bias is not just a technical (e.g., computational or statistical) problem, and its successful resolution requires deep insights into individual and organizational behavior, economic incentives, as well as complex dynamics of the sociotechnical systems in which the ADM models are embedded. We discuss a human-centric, fairness-aware ADM framework that highlights the holistic involvement of human decision makers in each step of ADM. We review the emerging literature on fairness-aware machine learning and then discuss various strategic decisions that humans need to make, such as formulating proper fairness objectives, recognizing fairness-induced trade-offs and implications, utilizing machine learning model outputs, and managing/governing the decisions of ADM models. We further illustrate how these strategic decisions are jointly informed by behavioral, economic, and design sciences. Our discussions reveal a number of future research opportunities uniquely suitable for Management Information Systems (MIS) researchers to pursue. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

The increasing prevalence of health-related social media may provide an avenue for drug safety profiling using patients' online posts. Recent advances in machine learning, especially in deep learning, have dramatically benefited ADE detection and extraction. However, despite the wide use of state-of-the-art deep learning models, prior research has predominantly analyzed each post independently instead of treating the relevant posts holistically. In this study, guided by the theories of transfer of learning, we adopted the design science research methodology and developed a deep learning-based approach by innovatively integrating historical profiles for ADE detection and extraction. Our framework—the Historical Awareness Multi-Level Embedding (HAMLE) model—outperformed existing state-of-the-art benchmarks by large margins. We also validated its real-world safety monitoring application using the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety warnings, and it showed promising performance in identifying previously unknown ADEs. This confirmed its potential for use as an early warning system for postmarketing surveillance.

The number of international construction arbitrations has significantly increased during the last decades. This increase has been accompanied by an increased interest in understanding how arbitrators make their decisions on the substance of disputes arising from international construction contracts. This paper constitutes the third publication of research undertaken to develop a conceptual framework to explain this arbitral decision-making process. It aims to assess the extent to which arbitrators take into account commercial norms and international construction law when determining the parties' disputes. This research follows a grounded theory approach and draws on primary and secondary data. The primary data are collected via semistructured interviews with 28 international construction arbitrators. The secondary data are collected from international construction arbitration awards and scholarly writings. This study finds that international construction arbitrators appear to pay considerable attention to the parties' contracts and the governing law of the contract when determining their disputes. However, the parties' contracts and its governing law do not seem to be the only sources of obligations. Some arbitrators are receptive to arguments based on commercial practice and international construction law but do not concur on the authority of these substantive norms. The prevailing opinion seems to give customs and usages the same authority they have under the substantive law and to constrain the invocation of international construction law. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Customs and trade usages; Decision making; Dispute resolution; International construction arbitration; International construction law; International construction projects","Contracts; Construction laws; Custom and trade usage; Decisions makings; Dispute resolution; International construction; International construction arbitration; International construction law; International construction projects; Norms construction; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132593302

Some firms launch in only a subset of markets at first, with later launches being conditional on debut-market performance. Such sequencing decreases the downside of potential innovation failure but increases the downside of potential competitive preemption. Consistent with this trade-off, handset makers during the feature-phone era sequence rollout more often when innovations are novel. Also consistent is that sequencing seems to respond to firms' past experience with failure and preemption, and that it begins in markets offering strong signals of success and failure—markets with competing innovations and sophisticated consumers, respectively. Our findings contribute to the understanding of entry strategy and opens avenues for researching intentional organizational experimentation. Managerial summary: Firms can decide whether to launch innovations little by little or everywhere at once. Trial launches allow firms to test commercial viability and react to outcomes before rolling out elsewhere, but risks that competitors get their first. An immediate global launch, by contrast, reduces the scope for competitive preemption but increases the costs of potential failure. Our article uses data from the handset industry to highlight conditions that shape rollout decisions and examine the debut markets sought out for trial launches. Firms tend to trial novel innovations in particular, and their experience with prior misses as well as flops influences their preference. Trial launches often begin in markets with strong competition and discerning consumers, indicating an initial prioritization of learning over monetization. Opportunities for experimentation during market rollout thus ought to feature in strategic considerations of entry timing. © 2022 The Authors.

For each purchasing strategy and for maintaining or not maintaining strategic inventory, two-price policies with or without a manufacturer rebate are investigated by comparing them with a benchmark model.

Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the models and sensitivity analyses are performed to examine the effects of the important problem parameters on the optimal decisions. From the theoretical and numerical results, both the manufacturer and the retailer can benefit from producing and selling the green product. The two purchasing opportunity strategy is obviously superior to the single purchasing opportunity strategy since it can improve the performances for both the manufacturer and the retailer.

The authors conducted a bibliometric analysis, based on an international trade analogy to explain the network of agribusiness journals and how these journals communicate with business and economics journals. Findings: Business and economics journals and, particularly the traditionally major ones, surprisingly were scarcely every used. However, the British Food Journal stood out with 50 citations to marketing and strategic management journals. Research limitations/implications: There are predominantly four such limitations: only 33 journals were studied, only one 5-year time period was involved, that time period is a few years old and the journal characteristics were derived using data from the “Scopes” and “Information for Authors” text on the website of each journal. Practical implications: Exchanges of agribusiness knowledge and information among diverse stakeholders (consumers, suppliers and public agencies) in a complex environment require a better understanding of the network of agribusiness journals and their relation to traditional business and economics journals. Social implications: Networks of journals facilitate cooperation and interactions to improve developments in the field. Originality/value: Examining citations from and to the field of agribusiness is interesting and important because knowledge is transferred through networks comprise those who contribute to journals, read them and learn from them, i.e. by “talking” to each other as well as by practitioners who also read and learn from those journals. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agribusiness; Business; Dendrogram; Economics; Networks","article; bibliometrics; consumer; economics; human; marketing; Pennsylvania; phylogenetic tree; physician",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118621943

To mitigate the potential harms of model misspecification in this context, various forms of distributionally robust optimization have been applied. Although many of these methodologies suffer from the problem of time inconsistency, the work of Klabjan et al. established a general time-consistent framework for such problems by connecting to the literature on robust Markov decision processes. Motivated by the fact that many forecasting models exhibit very special structure as well as a desire to understand the impact of positing different dependency structures in distributionally robust multistage optimization, we formulate and solve a time-consistent distributionally robust multistage newsvendor model, which naturally robustifies some of the simplest inventory models with demand forecasting. In particular, in some of the simplest such models, demand evolves as a martingale (i.e., expected demand tomorrow equals realized demand today). We consider a robust variant of such models in which the sequence of future demands may be any martingale with given mean and support. Under such a model, past realizations of demand are naturally incorporated into the structure of the uncertainty set going forward. We explicitly compute the minimax optimal policy (and worst-case distribution) in closed form by combining ideas from convex analysis, probability, and dynamic programming. We prove that, at optimality, the worst-case demand distribution corresponds to the setting in which inventory may become obsolete at a random time. To gain further insight, we prove weak convergence (as the time horizon grows large) to a simple and intuitive process. We also compare with the analogous setting in which demand is independent across periods (analyzed previously by Shapiro) and identify several differences between these models in the spirit of the price of correlations studied by Agrawal et al. Finally, we complement our results by providing both numerical experiments that illustrate the potential benefits and limitations of our approach as well as additional theoretical analyses exploring what happens when our modeling assumptions do not hold.

Under what conditions is the system (comprising the firm and its platform) sustainable in the long run? We investigate these questions in the context of last-mile delivery. We develop a discrete-time, stochastic dynamic program that captures the system’s profit from serving demand and the platform’s growth dynamics. The dynamic model incorporates a service constraint for the platform and a simple version of a stochastic network effect. We find that the answers to our research questions critically depend on two key parameters: the mean and variance of the cross-network effect. We conduct a numerical study with data from a last-mile delivery firm in Vietnam to illustrate our findings. © 2021 INFORMS.","cross-network effects; dynamic order allocation; market thickness; on-demand platform","Employment; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wages; Cross-network effects; Digital technologies; Dynamic order; Dynamic order allocation; Last mile; Market thickness; On demands; On-demand platform; Order allocation; Service organizations; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138472677

The DM can delay taking the action in order to experiment and gather additional information on Θ. We model the problem using a Bayesian sequential experimentation framework and use dynamic programming and diffusion-asymptotic analysis to solve it. For that, we consider environments in which the average number of experiments that is conducted per unit of time is large and the informativeness of each individual experiment is low. Under such regimes, we derive a diffusion approximation for the sequential experimentation problem, which provides a number of important insights about the nature of the problem and its solution. First, it reveals that the problems of (i) selecting the optimal sequence of experiments to use and (ii) deciding the optimal time when to stop experimenting decouple and can be solved independently. Second, it shows that an optimal experimentation policy is one that chooses the experiment that maximizes the instantaneous volatility of the belief process. Third, the diffusion approximation provides a more mathematically malleable formulation that we can solve in closed form and suggests efficient heuristics for the nonasympototic regime. Our solution method also shows that the complexity of the problem grows only quadratically with the cardinality of the set of actions from which the decision maker can choose. We illustrate our methodology and results using a concrete application in the context of assortment selection and new product introduction. Specifically, we study the problem of a seller who wants to select an optimal assortment of products to launch into the marketplace and is uncertain about consumers’ preferences. Motivated by emerging practices in e-commerce, we assume that the seller is able to use a crowd voting system to learn these preferences before a final assortment decision is made. In this context, we undertake an extensive numerical analysis to assess the value of learning and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the heuristics derived from the diffusion approximation. © 2021 INFORMS.","Bayesian demand learning; crowdvoting; dynamic programming; experiment design; experimentation; optimal stopping; sequential testing","Asymptotic analysis; Decision making; Diffusion; Statistical tests; Bayesian; Bayesian demand learning; Crowdvoting; Decision makers; Demand learning; Diffusion approximations; Experiment design; Experimentation; Optimal stopping; Sequential testing; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138460974

In many horizontally differentiated markets, prices are stable, and firms make infrequent adjustments to their product lines. Although prior research focused on product line design, we investigate how firms should allocate their marketing effort when their product lines are fixed. We propose a simple model to analyze product line marketing. Our model exhibits a flagship product effect in which the firm’s optimal marketing effort is concentrated, provided that the ratio between consumer tastes dispersion and the convexity of the cost of marketing effort is below a threshold. The flagship product is selected according to a marketing effort allocation index that measures the trade-off between a product’s markup and its potential market share. This result is robust with or without competition and whether prices are exogenous or endogenous. Firms often experience shocks to their marketing cost because of technological improvement or externalities. If a monopolist’s cost of marketing effort declines, she should place more emphasis on a low-utility, high-markup product. Conversely, if the cost increases, the monopolist may find it beneficial to focus her marketing effort on a high-utility, low-markup product. When multiproduct firms compete against each other, we show that if the opponent’s cost of marketing effort decreases, there can be a spillover effect, in which the firm benefits from the opponent’s cost reduction, thereby leading to a win-win situation. © 2021 INFORMS.","game theory; marketing effort allocation; multiproduct competition; product line","Commerce; Competition; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Marketing; Product design; Customer need; Effort allocation; Flagship product; Market price; Marketing effort allocation; Multi-products; Multiproduct competition; Product line design; Productline; Simple modeling; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137880208

The decision maker needs to choose a pair of items for comparison in each step, decide when to stop data collection, and make a final decision after stopping based on a sequential flow of information. Because of the complex ranking structure, existing sequential analysis methods are not suitable. In this paper, we formulate the problem under a Bayesian decision framework and propose sequential procedures that are asymptotically optimal. These procedures achieve asymptotic optimality by seeking a balance between exploration (i.e., finding the most indistinguishable pair of items) and exploitation (i.e., comparing the most indistinguishable pair based on the current information). New analytical tools are developed for proving the asymptotic results, combining advanced change of measure techniques for handling the level crossing of likelihood ratios and classic large deviation results for martingales, which are of separate theoretical interest in solving complex sequential design problems. A mirror-descent algorithm is developed for the computation of the proposed sequential procedures.

I investigate aspects of this topic for two major business entity types: one-person businesses (i.e., sole proprietors) and firms. Results show that one-person businesses tend to be more severely impacted by past adverse information than firms, and furthermore their improvement trends over time are more likely to be dismissed as noise than recognized as signals of change. While firms can offset old unfavorable conduct by engaging in new favorable behaviors, a sole proprietor's current favorable operations can remain dominated by decades-old actions. Results also indicate that decision makers perceive firms as more capable of truly changing. Moreover, while only decision makers with certain personality characteristics recognize signs of positive change from a sole proprietor, all decision makers detect and appreciate such changes in a firm's conduct. This study finds that limiting access to adverse past information is likely to be more helpful (or necessary) for one-person businesses, or more generally for individuals, than for firms. © 2022 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","implicit theories; privacy; reputation management; right to be forgotten; time-value of information","'current; Decision makers; Implicit theory; Privacy; Professional conduct; Reputation management; Right to be forgotten; Time values; Time-value of information; Value of information; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135045747

Our modeling exercises and numerical analyses suggest that both AP and TB are effective at achieving a high electrification level, while CC may only electrify the system to a low level. However, CC is the most cost-efficient as it simultaneously benefits drivers and customers, and allows finer intervention to the market. TB is the least cost-efficient as the platform prefers to deliver fewer customers to avoid the trip-based fees and surcharge drivers and customers for higher per-trip profits. Under all policies, the platform's best response is always to adopt fast chargers and gradually expand the charging network to accommodate the increasing charging needs of its electric vehicle fleet. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Annual permit fee; Commission cap; Electrification; Regulatory policies; Ridesourcing system; Trip-based fee","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Aggregate model; Annual permit fee; Commission cap; Cost-efficient; Electrification; Least cost; Modelling framework; Regulatory policies; Ridesourcing system; Trip-based fee; Sales; cost-benefit analysis; efficiency measurement; electric vehicle; electrification; energy resource; policy approach; regulatory framework; transportation infrastructure; transportation policy; transportation system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132915581

Additionally, the study investigates the mediating effects of two distinct forms of user identification (i.e., user identification with the GSN brand and user identification with the GSN community) as well as the moderating effects of user global identity on the relationship between PBG and user engagement with such brands. Covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to analyse data collected from users of a GSN (i.e., Facebook) in the United Kingdom (UK) and India. The results indicate that PBG significantly influences both active and passive user engagement. This relationship is mediated by users' identification with a GSN brand and community. Additionally, the findings indicate that the associations between PBG and user engagement (active/passive) on GSN vary as a function of users' global identity. The results also demonstrate some country-specific variations in key relationships. Finally, the study offers useful recommendations for social media managers to rethink and redesign their user engagement strategies, keeping in mind global cultural diversity. © 2022 The Authors","Active and passive user engagement; Brand globalness; Global identity; Social networks; User identification","User profile; Active and passive user engagement; Active/passive; Brand globalness; Global branding; Global identity; Passive users; Social identity theories; Social network; User engagement; User identification; Social networking (online); numerical model; social media; social network; India; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131118403

This topic is important because InfoSec IP is a complementary knowledge resource that can complement a firm's existing and new products, services, business models, and operations. This paper attempts to understand the marginal effects of having additional InfoSec IP on a firm's performance in terms of return on investment and market capitalization. We collected objective InfoSec IP data from the United States Patent Office, the United States Copyright Office, and Compustat. Specifically, our data includes various types of IP, including patents, copyrights, and patent portfolios. We exclude IT-security firms in this study because we are interested in the effect of InfoSec IP on non-IT security firms. We include panel regression models using fixed effects that test the interplays between the various types of InfoSec IP and a firm's performance. In addition, we conduct generalized moment method and Heckman correction model analyses to alleviate potential endogeneity and sampling biases. Our results suggest that InfoSec IP is positively related to both return on investment and market capitalization. Further, we find that diverse InfoSec IP portfolios strengthen the effects of a firm's InfoSec patents and copyrights on market capitalization. © 2022","Copyrights; Firm Performance; GMM; Heckman Correction Model; Information security; Intellectual property; Market Capitalization; Patents; Research & development; ROI","Commerce; Copyrights; Investments; Method of moments; Profitability; Regression analysis; Security of data; Security systems; Correction models; Firm Performance; GMM; Heckman correction model; Information security technologies; Knowledge resource; Market capitalization; Research development; Returns on investment; ROI; Patents and inventions; correction; industrial performance; information technology; intellectual property rights; investment; market conditions; research and development; security; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131070632

However, besides the expected benefits of participating in HIE in enhancing coordination, reducing costs, and improving patient safety, previous studies report that clinicians' rate of using HIE mechanisms is still low. Insufficient participation of clinicians in data exchange networks can diminish the value of HIE. Based on utility theory, this study aims to identify and categorize barriers associated with the implementation of HIE projects in healthcare organizations and develop a comprehensive model to empirically examine the effects of HIE inhibitors on clinicians' intention to engage in HIE networks. Data was collected using an online survey from 318 clinicians working in different healthcare settings in the United States. Results show that internal inhibitors (including technological and organizational barriers) and external inhibitors (including partners, patients, vendors, and legal barriers) strongly influence clinicians' intention to engage in HIEs. Taking an integrated approach, this study can contribute to the existing literature by providing a more informed way of conceptualizing and explaining HIE adoption in healthcare organizations. The findings can help HIE decision-makers, healthcare organizations, and providers to identify key HIE inhibitors and take corrective actions to address them. Addressing both internal and external inhibitors would increase the likelihood of widespread implementation of HIEs in different healthcare settings and facilitate interoperability and connectivity in regional and community health information networks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Clinicians; Electronic medical records; External barriers; Health information exchange; Internal inhibitors; Utility reducers","Decision making; Electronic data interchange; Health care; Information dissemination; Information services; Clinician; Empirical studies; Exchange programmes; External barrier; Health information exchange; Health informations; Healthcare organizations; Information exchanges; Internal inhibitor; Utility reducer; Medical computing; empirical analysis; health care; information policy; information technology; integrated approach; organization; public health; record; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130797242

After initial classification, both systems have been split into four subcategories. So conventional stocks portfolios of banks, insurance companies, investment banks, and mutual funds have been compared with Islamic banks, leasing, Modarabah, and Islamic mutual funds stocks in terms of return, risk, and conditional volatility. These results depict significant variations in returns and/or risks (unconditional variance) between these comparable financial systems. The risk premia of conventional stocks are considerably higher than their Islamic compeers. The hypothesis of efficient risk-return relationship is supported for all portfolios, but the relationship is much stronger for the Islamic stocks as compared to the conventional ones. Moreover, the lower reward of Islamic stocks is associated with lesser conditional volatility. The nonsynchronous effect and persistence in the volatility of returns are apparent in all stocks except Modarabah and Islamic mutual funds. Further, the impact of volatility clustering on returns of all stock portfolios is quite larger than external shock. © 2022 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","Diversification; Efficiency; EGARCH-M; Islamic finance; Risk premia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130322065

Existing studies have not clearly addressed relationships among current usage status, perceived utility, and future implementation of environmental sustainability indicators for companies. Accordingly, it is hard to reflect the underlying usage dynamics of environmental sustainability indicators during their development stage. This study aims to identify the usage dynamics of environmental sustainability indicators for manufacturing and service sectors in terms of utility (i.e., usefulness and practicality) and utilization (i.e., used in practice and future implementation). This study is based on survey data for the utility and utilization of 55 environmental sustainability indicators from global companies with manufacturing and service systems. Bayesian networks for the surveyed data are built to understand the causal relationships between the utility and utilization of environmental sustainability indicators depending on company characteristics (i.e., industry sector, company size, and target market location) and indicator categories (i.e., energy, water, resources, pollution, environment, and technique/process). Furthermore, the scenario-based probabilistic inferences of the Bayesian networks are analyzed to estimate changes in the present and future utilization of environmental sustainability indicators when the usefulness and practicality levels are improved. The results show that the indicator usage of the industry sectors may be characterized in two aspects: utility-based usage and experience-based usage. In the small and medium sized companies, current indicator usage affected by indicator practicality determines the future implementation of the indicators. Most major market locations have the same causal relationships of indicator usage dynamics as the large sized companies. Indicator practicality serves a main cause for the causal relationships in the usage dynamics of most indicator categories. Furthermore, the usage dynamics models show which perceived user aspects of environmental sustainability indicators should be emphasized more to result in proactive current and future indicator implementation for specific usage cases. The findings of this study provide general guidelines for the development of user-friendly environmental sustainability indicators. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian networks; Causal relationships; Environmental sustainability indicators; Indicator utility; Indicator utilization; Usage dynamics","Bayesian networks; Commerce; Manufacture; Surveys; Sustainable development; Water pollution; 'current; Bayesia n networks; Causal relationships; Environmental sustainability; Environmental sustainability indicator; Indicator utility; Indicator utilization; Service systems; Sustainability indicators; Usage dynamic; Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130178433

The theory predicts a positive relationship between inventory levels and the basis, and a negative correlation between inventories and marginal convenience yield. We investigate whether there is a defined and quantifiable relationship between inventory levels and market structure – defined as the basis or the corresponding degree of contango/backwardation – and what the exact nature of that relationship might be. The major drivers of inventories – the cost of carry, convenience yield and spread options value – are estimated for eight major international storage hubs using daily data from December 21, 2015, to January 25, 2019. The analysis indicates that basic predictions of inventory theory are valid for daily and weekly frequencies but become less reliable for lower frequency data. We propose an alternative: a spread option-based formulation that adds a locational dimension to the theory and is based on the prices of crude oil at different locations, factoring in costs of storage and transportation, and the time required to transport oil between them. This methodology offers a viable alternative to the traditional cost of carry approach; it can estimate implied convenience yields and the shadow price of inventories. The data and methodology proposed in this study can give policy makers a better understanding of implied convenience yields, shadow storage prices, and market direction. It can also facilitate the construction of timely and efficient policies in the domains of energy security, market stability, and the management of public crude oil inventories. A better understanding of the relationship between inventories and the term structure of oil prices can assist market participants in trading, hedging and inventory management. © 2022 The Authors","Convenience yield; Cost of carry; Oil inventories; Spread options; Storage theory","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Crude oil; Digital storage; Energy security; Investments; Complex relationships; Convenience yield; Cost of carries; Inventory levels; Negative correlation; Oil inventory; Spot and futures prices; Spread option; Storage theory; Term structure; Inventory control; complexity; cost analysis; energy market; energy storage; inventory; oil supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126893404

It utilizes a CSR framework that encompasses a social license to operate (SLO), accountability and community engagement. Household survey, key informant interviews, and secondary sources provided data for the study. The results indicate that the degree of effectiveness of the three dimensions of CSR towards meaningful development in the mining communities were generally low. The economic dimension of CSR was the highest (54%), followed by the social dimensions (48%), while environmental effectiveness was the lowest (27%). Lack of active community involvement in the planning and implementation of CSR programs and local political structures undermine the effectiveness of CSR initiatives in host communities. Moreover, the study reveals that extant CSR approaches are not the most optimal in ensuring meaningful development of mining communities as they are for the most part not community-driven. The study also demonstrates that even though the industrial mining company maintains its SLO through laudable ventures such as road maintenance, allowing women to engage in stone mining, and constructing a health care center, its recent handling of educational support was questionable. Furthermore, company-led development projects may not always be the priority needs of diverse groups within the host communities. The study calls for community-driven CSR in the true sense (including representatives of youth, women, elders, disabled, civil society) not just the views of powerful and influential traditional leaders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Industrial diamond mining; Local development; Sierra Leone; Transnational mining companies","Diamonds; Economic and social effects; Industrial economics; Mining; Corporate social responsibility; Diamond mining; Industrial diamond mining; License to operate; Local development; Mining communities; Mining companies; Sierra Leone; Trans-national minings; Transnational mining company; Surveys; conceptual framework; corporate social responsibility; diamond; mining industry; resource management; Sierra Leone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126091952

We exploit a unique data set of over 15,000 small private firms in the United States and find that when state UI benefits are high, firms will offer their employees health insurance benefits—especially when those firms rely on human capital that is difficult to replace. We find positive effects of health insurance policy on worker retention, worker productivity, and firm performance. We discuss the implications of our findings to the theory development on the relationship between exogenous labor market frictions and firms' responses to those frictions. Managerial Summary: This study examines whether small firms that offer health insurance to their employees have better performance outcomes. Even though health insurance is a costly investment for small firms, there has been scant strategy- and evidence-based guidance for managers regarding the conditions that can render investments in employee health ultimately worthwhile. The study analyzes data from 15,000 small firms in the United States and finds that offering health insurance when retaining and replacing workers by firms is more difficult. Firms that offer health insurance also have better worker retention, productivity, and profitability compared to firms that do not offer health insurance.

This article examines how contracts govern relationship-specific investment in the face of these frictions. In our model, investment increases the value the supplier creates for the buyer ex post by adapting a component to her needs. At the same time, specific investment exposes the supplier to haggling, while providing him with knowledge needed to appropriate the buyer's preexisting resources. By muting both haggling and adaptation incentives, “closed price” contracts elicit higher investment than “open price” contracts when adaptation is unimportant, and lower investment otherwise. Moreover, an optimal price format seeks to incentivize investment when resource appropriation is unimportant, and to disincentivize investment otherwise. Our evidence on component procurement contracts supports both predictions. Managerial Summary: This study offers new insights on how OEMs govern their collaborations with suppliers. We examine settings where the supplier invests in producing a dedicated component, and ask under which contractual form she is more/less motivated to invest. We find that “closed price” contracts decrease supplier's investment when the component has a complex interface with the OEM's product, and hence is more subject to post-contractual adaptation. We also find that OEMs choose the contract that discourages investment when they possess unique resources that too-closely-involved suppliers may copy or appropriate. Managers at OEMs that possess proprietary technologies and customer bases are exposed to the appropriation downside of suppliers' dedicated investment, and will thus benefit from learning through our study how other professionals address this issue. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","adaptation; contract; governance; price format; specific investments; transaction cost economics","Costs; Friction; Managers; Sales; Complex interface; Customerbase; Exposed to; OEM products; Procurement contracts; Proprietary technologies; Specific investment; Transaction cost; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122683379

Because most firms have little influence on prices in either output or input markets, oftentimes productivity change is thought to be the most relevant determinant of profitability change. When firms produce a product by harvesting or extracting government-regulated natural resource stocks, it is important for regulators to understand how their decisions influence firm profitability and its underlying drivers. In this study, we use a recently developed index number decomposition method to identify the drivers of profitability, price, and productivity change for vessels operating in the U.S. northeast scallop fishery. Our main finding is that increases in profitability over the period 1996 to 2015 were primarily due to increases in prices for scallops, combined with favorable biomass change. Fishing vessels were able to get higher prices for their harvest because of an innovative spatial harvest strategy, which resulted in catches of large, premium-priced scallops. Remarkably, this system resulted in both an increase in vessels harvesting scallops and large increases in profitability. © 2021 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association.

In addition, a higher economic growth rate reduces cigarette consumption of male but not female. It reduces cigarette consumption of the lower-middle and senior age males, but does not significantly change consumption among the young males. Of these three groups, only the middle-aged males show a decrease in their smoking participation rate with higher economic growth.

Due to the nature of the Chinese energy sector as a monopoly and to the influence of the Soviet Union, the wages of public sector employees in the energy industry in China are much less influenced by market mechanisms and are much higher than those in the private sector. This paper is the first article to explore the impact of the public sector on wage gaps in the energy industry using the China Urban Household Survey for 2004, 2008, and 2013. The cross-sectional regression results show a significant and continuous wage premium exists between sectors, although the size of the premium declined slightly over time. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition finds unexplainable part and discrimination dominates the wage gaps. The quantile regression results show that education and work experience have significant effects on low- and middle-wage groups. The heterogeneity analysis considers two sub-industries and finds that the wage gaps between the two sectors are much higher in the extractive segment of the energy industry than in the production and supply sector of the industry. The results of the study reveal that market-oriented reforms in China are not yet complete, because the obvious premium on wages in the public sector means they are not determined by market mechanisms. Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations from three perspectives: further market-oriented reform, elimination of discrimination, and education and vocational training.

The authors advance the views of platform ecosystems in the innovation literature by introducing a contingency perspective that underscores the role of market, organizational and technological innovativeness in product platform strategy. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores three contingent factors, specifically market innovativeness, technological innovativeness and organizational innovativeness that affect the product platform strategy of high-tech firms. The theoretical model is empirically validated using survey data from 191 high-tech firms. Findings: Using a data set of high-tech manufacturing firms, the results show that product platform strategy is positively related to firm performance. Additionally, the results provide evidence supporting the positive moderating effect of the three-way interaction among market, organizational and technological innovativeness on the contribution of product platform strategy to firm performance. Research limitations/implications: A platform product strategy is a determining factor in firm performance that requires firms to have a “fit” with their innovation activities. This study contributes to theoretical development at the intersection of product platform strategy and innovativeness. Practical implications: When firms seek to align their technological innovativeness with their organizational innovativeness, the benefits of such innovativeness may be more pronounced in a platform product context. Moreover, the results may help guide platform managers and decision makers in identifying and securing appropriate innovation activities to enhance product platform strategies. Originality/value: This study provides a product platform strategy in B2B platform ecosystems and shows how different innovation activities interact to improve the product platform strategy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2B platform ecosystem; Market innovativeness; Organizational innovativeness; Product platform strategy; Technological innovativeness","Commerce; Ecosystems; Manufacture; Product design; B2B platform ecosystem; Innovativeness; Market innovativeness; Organizational innovativeness; Platform ecosystems; Platform strategy; Product platform strategy; Product platforms; Technological innovativeness; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124336071

To learn node representations from such dynamic graphs for better stock predictions, we propose the hybrid-attention dynamic graph neural network, an inductive graph representation learning method. We also extended mini-batch gradient descent to inductive representation learning on dynamic stock graphs so that the model can update parameters over mini-batch stock graphs with higher training efficiency. Extensive experiments on stocks from different markets and trading simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves stock predictions.

Academic/practical relevance: The problem is motivated by the practice in coal-fired power plants, an important part of the energy sector, where two types of coal with different energy content per unit mass are blended for electrical power generation. Our model is the first to capture the key operational features in this context. Methodology: We model the problem as a Markov decision process and develop a novel approximate optimization approach to analyze and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. Results: We show that a use-down-to/balancing production policy and modified order-up-to ordering policy is optimal. We also propose a heuristic policy based on piece-wise linear value function approximation. Whereas computing the value function approximation via brute-force is time-consuming because of the curse of dimensionality, we leverage the structure of the optimal policy to develop an algorithm that greatly improves the computational time of the value function approximation. Our numerical studies on both a synthetic data set and real-world data show that the proposed heuristic provides significant profit improvement over three simpler straw policies, some of which are used in practice. Managerial implications: Our paper suggests the significant profit improvement opportunity of using our proposed policy and demonstrates how one can develop computationally more efficient heuristic policies by leveraging the structure of the optimal policy.

Methodology/Results: We conduct a behavioral experiment using the beer distribution game. We estimate decision rules using multilevel modeling approaches that overcome several drawbacks of the estimation methods used in the earlier literature. We find robust evidence that, contrary to the overreaction when in backlog hypothesis and reports from popular press, decision makers order less aggressively and become insensitive to the scope of the problem when in backlog-a scope neglect phenomenon. Managerial implications: We propose a dual-process theoretical account predicated on affective reactions to explain this scope neglect. Our results suggest that affective reactions under novel operating conditions or dramatic events in supply chains, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can overwhelm cognitive processing of managers and make them fail to recognize the full scope of the problems faced and update decision models accordingly. Understanding the cognitive-affective drivers of ordering behaviors that generate supply chain instability is important in designing interventions to mitigate their negative effects.

Importantly, customers may disengage when offered poor recommendations. Academic/practical relevance: Online platforms often personalize product recommendations using bandit algorithms, which balance an exploration-exploitation trade-off. However, customer disengagement-a salient feature of platforms in practice-introduces a novel challenge because exploration may cause customers to abandon the platform. We propose a novel algorithm that constrains exploration to improve performance. Methodology: We present evidence of customer disengagement using data from a major airline's ad campaign; this motivates our model of disengagement, where a customer may abandon the platform when offered irrelevant recommendations. We formulate the customer preference learning problem as a generalized linear bandit, with the notable difference that the customer's horizon length is a function of past recommendations. Results: We prove that no algorithm can keep all customers engaged. Unfortunately, classical bandit algorithms provably overexplore, causing every customer to eventually disengage. Motivated by the structural properties of the optimal policy in a scalar instance of our problem, we propose modifying bandit learning strategies by constraining the action space up front using an integer program. We prove that this simple modification allows our algorithm to perform well by keeping a significant fraction of customers engaged. Managerial implications: Platforms should be careful to avoid overexploration when learning customer preferences if customers have a high propensity for disengagement. Numerical experiments on movie recommendations data demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly improve customer engagement.

Although SBT carries potential benefits for both parties in the supplier-retailer dyad, it may also yield asymmetric gains to these parties, particularly because SBT can impose greater inventory costs to suppliers through shrink. We document the financial benefits in terms of supply chain profit creation and allocation based on the differences in bargaining power between parties in a vertical channel under SBT vis-à-vis the more traditional vendor-managed inventory (VMI) contracts. Academic/practical relevance: Although prior literature has examined inventory benefits and drawbacks from VMI and SBT contracts in retailer-supplier dyads, it has failed to offer a systematic evaluation of the relative impact of these contract forms on bargaining power and profits in these dyads. We address this knowledge gap. Methodology: To that end, we use a methodological approach that incorporates an empirical Nash-in-Nash bargaining model, a supplementary regression, and a counterfactual simulation. Results: We find that retailer bargaining power is higher under SBT relative to VMI contracts. Moreover, the direct effects of a retailer switching from VMI to SBT regimes generate an average increase of 25% in total supply chain profit, allowing the retailer and its supplier to increase their profit by 20% and 29%, respectively. However, although the retailer's profit share decreases by approximately 3.5%, the supplier's increases by about 3.3%. We attribute the decrease in the retailer's share to a stronger bargaining position on the supplier side based on higher supplier shrink costs. Managerial implications: Our findings provide managers with more transparent information regarding the set of outcomes they can expect should they choose to enter into SBT contracts. Importantly, we show how an outcome that has significantly hindered the adoption of SBT contracts (i.e., shrink costs) can enter into the negotiation between retailers and suppliers to optimally split the dyadic surplus of the contracts between these parties.

Academic/practical relevance: The improvement in overall system performance due to redundant customers has been established in prior work. We address the question of fairness- whether the benefit experienced by redundant customers adversely affects others who can only join a single line. This question is particularly relevant to organ transplantation, as critics have contended that multiple listing provides unfair access to organs for patients based on wealth. Methodology: We analyze two queues serving two classes of customers; the redundant class joins both queues, whereas the nonredundant class joins a single queue randomly. We compare this system against a benchmark wherein the redundant class resorts to joining the shortest queue (JSQ) if multiple queue joining were not allowed, capturing the most likely case if multilisting was prohibited: Affluent patients could still afford to list in the region with the shorter wait list. Results: We prove that when the arrival rate of nonredundant customers is balanced across both queues, they actually benefit under redundancy of the other class-that is, redundancy is fair. We also establish that redundancy may be unfair under some circumstances: Nonredundant customers are worse off if their arrival rate is strongly skewed toward one of the queues. We illustrate how these findings apply in the organ-transplantation setting through a numerical study using publicly available data. Managerial implications: Our analysis helps identify when, and by how much, multiple listing may be unfair and, as such, could be a useful tool for policy makers who may be concerned with trying to ensure equitable access to resources, such as organs, across patients with differing wealth levels.

The interruptions are organized in a two-by-two framework in which they result (or do not result) in a physical task requirement and lead to a varying degree of attention shift from the primary task. Academic/practical relevance: Prior operations management literature primarily examines the long-term effects of a single class of interruption that reduces performance. Our study contributes to this literature by examining multiple classes of interruptions that lead to positive and negative outcomes over the short-term in addition to the long-term. Further, our study also contributes to understanding the impact of general task transitions (interruptions) on worker performance, and the interrupting tasks include tasks that are not part of workers' primary job duties. Our study is relevant to work settings that envelop high manual labor and experience interruptions regularly. Finally, we offer strategies to improve operational performance. Methodology: Using a granular data set on worker productivity from 211 harvesters yielding 117,581 truckloads of fruit harvested for 9,819 worker shifts, we utilize an instrumental variable approach with two-stage residual inclusion estimation on a mix of linear and nonlinear models to examine and quantify the impact of interruptions on both short- and long-term worker productivity. Results: We identify a new interruption class, a pause-interruptions that provide the physical respite and limit the degree of attention shift from the primary task. We find that pauses improve worker productivity in the short- and long-term. Next, we find that scheduled breaks hurt (improve) the worker's productivity in the short-term (long-term). Finally, we find that harvester breakdown and travel across field interruptions that drain physical resources and cause attention shift hurt worker productivity in the short- and long-term. We quantify the impact (in our field context) of a five-minute increase in each of these work interruptions on average worker productivity. Managerial implications: Our study demonstrates that various work interruptions can have positive or negative effects on workers' productivity. We suggest that introducing brief pauses in a workday and simultaneously reminding (before initiating the pause) employees about the tasks yet to be completed or goals to be achieved for the rest of the shift can help maintain their focus on the work and yield high-performance benefits. We also suggest strategies that limit the restart costs and increase the predictability of interruptions that hurt performance. For example, in regards to scheduled breaks, planning the break after completing a subtask or reaching a subgoal can limit their adverse effects. Further, informing workers on the possibility of interruption circumstances at the beginning of the work shift can help them plan for these events and improve engagement and performance on the primary job.

In a general setting, heterogeneous customers arrive sequentially, each of which can be allocated to a resource in an online fashion. Customers stochastically consume the resources, allocations yield stochastic rewards, and the system receives feedback outcomes with delay. We introduce a generic framework that judiciously synergizes online learning with a broad class of online resource allocation mechanisms, where the sequence of customer contexts is adversarial, and the customer reward and the resource consumption are stochastic and unknown. First, we propose an online algorithm for a general resource allocation problem, called personalized resource allocation while learning with delay, which strikes a three-way balance between exploration, exploitation, and hedging against adversarial arrival sequence. We provide a performance guarantee for this online algorithm in terms of Bayesian regret. Next, we develop our second online algorithm for an advance scheduling problem, called personalized advance scheduling while learning with delay (PAS-LD), and evaluate its theoretical performance. The PAS-LD algorithm has a more delicate structure and offers multiday scheduling while accounting for the no-show behavior of customers. We demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our PAS-LD algorithm using clinical data from a partner health system. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides promising results compared with several benchmark policies.

We study the widely used sample average approximation (SAA) approach and analyze its performance with respect to regret, which is the difference between its expected cost and the optimal cost of the clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand distribution. We characterize how the regret performance depends on a minimal separation assumption that restricts the local flatness of the demand distribution around the optimal order quantity. In particular, we consider two separation parameters, γ and ε, where γ denotes the minimal possible value of the density function in a small neighborhood of the optimal quantity and ε defines the size of the neighborhood. We establish a lower bound on the worst case regret of any policy that depends on the product of the separation parameters γε and the time horizon N. We also show a finite-time upper bound of SAA that matches the lower bound in terms of the separation parameters and the time horizon (up to a logarithmic factor of N). This illustrates the near-optimal performance of SAA with respect to not only the time horizon, but also the local flatness of the demand distribution around the optimal quantity. Our analysis also shows upper bounds of O(log N) and O(√ N) on the worst case regret of SAA over N periods with and without the minimal separation assumption. Both bounds match the lower bounds implied by the literature, which illustrates the asymptotic optimality of the SAA approach.

Some of the revenue for items removed from the assortment may be recouped by substitution, but also some of the revenue for items kept in the assortment may be lost due to basket abandonment. For a practical setting where baskets may contain any subset of items from thousands of products, estimating both substitution and basket effects is a challenge. To address this, we develop a demand model that combines a multinomial logit (MNL) model to estimate substitution within a subcategory and a purchase-incidence model to estimate basket retention. Using transaction and product availability data from 12 stores of an office supplies retail chain that were dramatically downsized from large- to small-format stores, we show that (i) storewide basket effects are substantial (our model with basket effects predicts out-of-sample transactions with mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of only 7% compared with 22% for a model with only substitution effects), (ii) poor service level can significantly exacerbate lost profit due to abandoned baskets at these stores, and (iii) consideration of the basket effect in assortment selection for the small stores can significantly improve basket retention and increase profits (by up to 16%) at these stores.

Example applications are to seamless phase II/III dose-finding trials and to trials that test multiple combinations of therapies. Our objective is to maximize the expected population health-economic benefit of health-technology adoption decisions less clinical trial costs. We show that unifying the adaptive, multiarm, and value-based approaches to trial design can reduce the cost and duration of multiarm trials with efficient adaptive look ahead policies that focus on value to patients and account for correlated rewards across arms. Features that differentiate our approach from much other work on stochastic optimization include stopping times that balance sampling costs and the expected value of information of those samples, performance guarantees offered by new asymptotic convergence proofs, and the modeling of arms' potentially different sampling costs. Our proposed solution can be computed feasibly and can randomize patients. The class of trials for the base model assumes that health-economic data are collected and observed quickly. Related work from Bayesian optimization can enable the further inclusion of trials with intermediate duration delays between the time of treatment initiation and observation of outcomes.

Using human subject experimentation, we study the effectiveness of message appeals in encouraging defenders to adopt two mitigation strategies, investment in security and refusal to pay ransoms, to digital extortion threats. We explore two types of appeals, benefit and normative, for this purpose. We find that the decisions of the defenders (representing any organization that can be a potential victim) deviate from the predictions of game theory. However, given the strategic interactions between the defenders and the attacker as well as noisy decision-making behaviors, it is challenging to untangle the influence of the appeals on the defenders. We develop a structural model based on the quantal response equilibrium framework to measure how message appeals change the defenders' utilities of investment and payment refusal. Although the interventions may be successful in increasing the utilities of investment and/or payment refusal, their impacts on investment rate and payment rate are mitigated by the attacker reducing ransoms. Thus, it is challenging for an intervention to significantly boost a community's investment rate or to suppress the ransom payment rate. We characterize how security outcomes of a community (including expected ransom, attack rate, investment rate, and payment rate) vary with the defenders' utilities of investment and pay refusal.

These conversions have drawn public scrutiny and triggered a debate about the implications of ownership conversions on nursing home performance. Exploring a nationwide panel data set of U.S. nursing homes from 2006 to 2017, we observe that nursing homes with higher financial distress are associated with higher likelihood of NP-to-FP conversions. The postconversion operating margins increased significantly. Converted nursing homes improved their financial performance by reducing operating costs while keeping net resident revenues unchanged. Both cutting registered nurse staffing and cutting overhead staffing contributed to reductions in operating costs; however, only the former cost-reduction measure had a negative impact on quality. On average, the postconversion quality of care declined. The effects of NP-to-FP conversions on nursing homes were moderated by preconversion financial distress: High-distress nursing homes aggressively cut registered nurse staffing and experienced severe quality decline, whereas low-distress ones kept registered nurse staffing unchanged and largely avoided quality decline. These findings lead to both policy and managerial insights. To nursing home regulators, we recommend increased oversight on NP-to-FP conversions of nursing homes with high preconversion financial distress. To managers of nursing homes undergoing NP-to-FP conversions, our findings suggest that although cost reduction is an effective strategy to improve financial performance, they need to avoid the pitfall of cutting registered nurse staffing and instead focus on streamlining overhead operations in order to increase operating efficiency without compromising quality.

Such a copy-trading mechanism often runs into a transparency-revenue tension. On the one hand, social trading platforms need to release traders' trades as transparently as possible to allow followers to evaluate traders accurately. On the other hand, complete transparency may undercut the platform's revenue because followers can free ride. That is, followers can manually copy the trades of a trader to avoid paying the following fees. This study addresses this critical tension by optimizing the level of transparency through delaying the release of trading information pertaining to the trades executed by traders. We capture the economic impact of the delay using the notions of profit-gap and delayed-profit. We propose a mechanism that elucidates the economic effects of the profit-gap and delayed-profit on followers and, consequently, the amount of money following a trader: protection effect and evaluation effect. Empirical investigations find support for these two effects. We then develop a stochastic control formulation that optimizes platform revenue, where the control is the optimal delay customized at the trader level and calculated as a function of the current amount of money following a trader and the number of views on the trader's profile page. The optimized revenue can be incorporated into an algorithm to provide a systematic way to infuse the platform's goals into the ranking of the traders. A counterfactual study is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the optimal delay policy (versus a constant-delay policy) using data from a leading social trading platform operating in the foreign exchange market.

However, managers of public firms who obtain stock-based incentives may alter inventory operations to influence the stock price. We develop a stylized model, which shows that, in the presence of an interest in the stock price, managers over-install inventory when it can either inflate sales or deflate the reported cost of goods sold even if the market anticipates such actions. We analyze the joint and marginal effects of the stock-based incentives and the cost of using inventory to manage earnings, which may provide useful implications for the detection of inventory distortion and the design of management incentive plans. We then conduct an empirical analysis based on the financial data of U.S. publicly listed retailers and manufacturers. We find positive (negative) correlation between firms' abnormal excess inventory and the stock-based incentives of their top executives (the inventory manipulation cost). Moreover, the marginal effect of the stock-based incentives on the abnormal excess inventory is the strongest when the inventory manipulation cost is intermediate. Our empirical analysis also shows that this effect becomes statistically weaker after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This is in line with the prediction of our analytical model about the effect of the accuracy of financial reporting.

We find that intelligence improves forecaster performance when market mispricing is low, manipulativeness improves forecaster performance when mispricing is high, and the degree to which theory of mind skills matter depends on both the level of mispricing and how information is displayed. All three of these results are consistent with hypotheses derived from the previous literature. Additionally, we observe that male forecasters outperform female forecasters after controlling for intelligence, manipulativeness, and theory of mind skills as well as risk aversion. Interestingly, we do not find any evidence that forecaster performance improves with experience across markets or within markets.

Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the (Formula presented.) -values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman (Formula presented.) -values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the Gambiteer is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden–Kieretsky–Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith–Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess. We conclude with directions for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

The results show geographic diffusion of iron bean planting material occurs among neighboring farmers that exhibit interdependent decision-making patterns, as well as similar characteristics relative to the group.

First, a differentiated geographical targeting strategy for bush and climbing bean varieties as a function of farmer and farm characteristics should increase iron bean adoption rates.

Careful use of backcountry terrain through effective decision making can mitigate the risk of dangerous snowpack conditions, but requires relevant knowledge and experience. We present the results from a large-scale crowd sourced data collection method from backcountry users. Using GPS tracking via a smartphone application, coupled with online surveys, we investigate the intersection of geographical complexity, backcountry experience, demographics and behavioral biases on decision-making while navigating hazardous winter terrain. We use data from 770 GPS tracks, representing almost 1.3 million GPS points, as a geographic expression of a group's resulting decisions, and use them to quantify and understand their decision-making process. Our analysis focuses on the change in terrain use as quantified using the Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES), and time spent in avalanche terrain, as a function of experience, avalanche hazard and other group factors. We show that self-identified experts rate themselves as significantly more skilled and also had higher levels of avalanche education. Experts also had an increased exposure to avalanche terrain overall, and also more severe terrain, as represented by median time in class 3 ATES terrain. © 2022 The Authors","Decision making; GIS; GPS; Heuristic traps; Human factors; Terrain analysis","decision making; GIS; GPS; snow avalanche; snowpack; terrain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131453641

To this end, this study maps the SC, records manufacturing processing inputs and outputs, and reviews relevant CE interventions that can be applied. The identified interventions are then assessed at an economic, environmental and social level via analyzing economic indicators, conducting a Life Cycle Assessment, and providing a critical discussion on the possible social impacts. Specifically, four scenarios are compared for the case of a canning facility with an annual processing capacity of 10,000 tons of peaches, including: (i) no valorisation to of the peach kernel, (ii) utilization of the peach kernel to generate energy from combustion, (iii) use of the peach kernel to extract oil, and (iv) peach kernel processing for producing both energy and peach oil. The results indicate that all identified CE interventions are advantageous, with the combination of biomass energy and peach oil production being the preferable scenario resulting in a 6.22% increase of the Gross Profit Margin (due to lower energy cost and added revenue from the peach oil) and 16.58% reduction of CO2 emissions (due to the reduced use of crude oil). Notably, peach oil production can be a viable investment for industries that do not have the capital to invest in a biomass plant. Regarding the social aspects, this reconfiguration could benefit farmers by supporting their income under the assumption that the derived profits are distributed fairly.

We use a unique dataset of new registrations of electric fleets in the UK for a 20-year period (1999–2019). Our results show that financial purchase incentives positively impact new registrations of electric fleets, and this effect is positively moderated by GDP change. Marginal analysis reveals three categories of adopters that purchase electric fleets at different levels of policy and GDP change: insensitive adopters, standard adopters, and sensitive adopters. Overall, financial incentives may be more effective in fostering the adoption of electric fleets when set to levels that are conditioned on the level of GDP change. In particular, financial purchase incentives are most effective when GDP change and incentives are above their average level. © 2022 The Authors","Electric fleets; Government policy; Green innovation policy; Sustainable innovation; Sustainable technology adoption","Finance; Public policy; Purchasing; Electric fleet; Green innovation policy; Green innovations; Gross domestic products; Innovation policies; Product changes; Sustainable innovation; Sustainable technology; Sustainable technology adoption; Technology adoption; Sales; electric vehicle; governance approach; Gross Domestic Product; incentive; innovation; sustainable development; technology adoption; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131087970

The role of energy prices in shaping economic growth relates not only to geopolitical risks or environmental taxes but also to a range of strategies that place moratoria on primary energy sources like nuclear, coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Applying a new data set for country-level energy prices since 1960, this study evaluates the effects of energy prices on economic growth in 18 OECD countries by controlling for other important macroeconomic conditions that shape economic activity. Mean-group estimates that control for cross-country correlations are used to emphasize average responses across nations. Averaged across all nations, results suggest that a 10% increase in energy prices dampened economic growth by about 0.15%.

This paper briefly explains AI and looks into the future to highlight some of AI's broader and longer-term societal implications. We propose that AI can be combined with entrepreneurship to represent a super tool. Scholars can research the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship to explore the possibilities of this potential AI-entrepreneurship super tool and hopefully direct its use to productive processes and outcomes. We focus on specific entrepreneurship topics that benefit from AI's augmentation potential and acknowledge implications for entrepreneurship's dark side. We hope this paper stimulates future research at the AI-entrepreneurship nexus. Executive summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that are trained to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, interpret external data, learn from that external data, and use that learning to flexibly adapt to tasks to achieve specific outcomes. Machine learning is the most common form of AI and largely relies on supervised learning—when the machine (i.e., AI) is trained with labels applied by humans. Deep learning and adversarial learning involve training on unlabeled data, or when the machine (via its algorithms) clusters data to reveal underlying patterns. AI is simply a tool. Entrepreneurship is also simply a tool. How they are combined and used will determine their impact on humanity. While researchers have independently developed a greater understanding of entrepreneurship and AI, these two streams of research have primarily run in parallel. To indicate the scope of current and future AI, we provide examples of AI (at different levels of development) for four sectors—customer service, financial, healthcare, and tertiary education. Indeed, experts from industry research and consulting firms suggest many AI-related business opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue. Further, we elaborate on several of these opportunities, including opportunities to (1) capitalize on the “feeling economy,” (2) redistribute occupational skills in the economy, (3) develop and use new governance mechanisms, (4) keep humans in the loop (i.e., humans as part of the decision making process), (5) expand the role of humans in developing AI systems, and (6) expand the purposes of AI as a tool. After discussing the range of business opportunities that experts suggest will prevail in the economy with AI, we discuss how entrepreneurs can use AI as a tool to help them increase their chances of entrepreneurial success. We focus on four up-and-coming areas for entrepreneurship research: a more interaction-based perspective of (potential) entrepreneurial opportunities, a more activities-based micro-foundation approach to entrepreneurial action, a more cognitively hot perspective of entrepreneurial decision making and action, and a more compassionate and prosocial role of entrepreneurial action. As we discuss each topic, we also suggest opportunities to design an AI system (i.e., entrepreneurs as potential AI designers) to help entrepreneurs (i.e., entrepreneurs as AI users). AI is an exciting development in the technology world. How it transforms markets and societies depends in large part on entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs can use AI to augment their decisions and actions in pursuing potential opportunities for productive gains. Thus, we discuss entrepreneurs' most critical tasks in developing and managing AI and explore some of the dark-side aspects of AI. Scholars also have a role to play in how entrepreneurs use AI, but this role requires the hard work of theory building, theory elaboration, theory testing, and empirical theorizing. We offer some AI topics that we hope future entrepreneurship research will explore. We hope this paper encourages scholars to consider research at the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Entrepreneurship; Machine learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130404734

Yet, it is inconclusive on how project experience alters the way of responding to the vibrant environment. Grounded on the dynamic capabilities theory, this study aims to examine how consulting firms with different project experience configures dynamic capabilities to be competitive. To do so, this study first reviews the literature on dynamic capabilities applied to project management, followed by a questionnaire survey and case studies to better comprehend how PBFs with varying project experience use their dynamic capabilities. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was employed to analyze the questionnaire-survey data. Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, the dynamic capabilities of PBFs are conceptualized as a four dimension framework, comprising project opportunity sensing, external integrating, internal coordinating, and project-based learning. The empirical results show that PBFs with richer experience would less rely on project opportunity sensing but still have to commit to external integrating, internal coordinating, and project-based learning.

However, many indicators suffer from structural breaks leading to forecast failure. Methods that are robust following a structural break have been proposed in the literature but they come at a cost: an increase in forecast error variance. We propose a method to select between a set of robust and non-robust forecasting models. Our method uses time-series clustering to identify possible structural breaks in a time series, and then switches between autoregressive forecasting models depending on the series dynamics. We perform a rigorous empirical evaluation with 400 simulated series with an artificial structural break and with real data economic series: Industrial Production and Consumer Prices for all Western European countries available from the OECD database. Our results show that the proposed method statistically outperforms benchmarks in forecast accuracy for most case scenarios, particularly at short horizons. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cluster analysis; Forecasting; Machine learning; Model selection; Structural breaks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129247244

We focus on how public reports about controversial business practices motivate a company to make adjustments so that environmental and social concerns are better included in its supply chain management practices. Using agenda-setting theory, we identify managerial commitment as an important factor in transmitting external media pressure. We analyse longitudinal data, ranging from 2002 through 2014 and collected for more than 700 US-based corporations. Our findings reveal that companies significantly increase SSCM after being the subject of negative news, particularly when management commitment to environmental sustainability and social welfare is high. Our findings should encourage supply chain decision makers to consider more broadly how external stakeholders view their global supply chain operations. Our research sheds light on negative news as an external factor; previous literature used media attention as anecdotal evidence and focused more on internal company factors. We contribute to research in SSCM by studying the mediation effect.

Extant construction literature highlights that the poor WLB in the industry is a work stressor that leads to a low level of organizational commitment (OC), which is a strong predictor of employee turnover and productivity. However, little attention has been paid to understanding how WLB affects OC, which could hinder construction organizations from developing targeted measures to improve OC. This study addressed this gap by using the A Shortened Stress Evaluation Tool (ASSET) model grounded in occupational stress theory to depict the underlying mechanisms of how WLB affects OC through the mediation effect psychological well-being [i.e., positive emotions (PE) and sense of purpose (SP)]. The ASSET questionnaire was used to measure the constructs via an online questionnaire survey administered to construction professionals around the globe registered with the Association for Project Management, the Chartered Institute of Building, and the Project Management Institute. A total of 255 valid responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Contrary to previous research, this study found that WLB does not have a direct impact on OC. Instead, it affects OC through the mediation effects of SP and PE. These results indicate that construction firms could benefit from enhancing SP and PE to yield greater organizational commitment rather than emphasizing enhanced WLB per se. This could be done by increasing employee participation in setting goals and objectives, clarifying the meaning and purpose of work, working to align work goals and objectives with employees' sense of meaning and purpose, and generating a greater frequency of experienced positive emotions by creating work environments that satisfy the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction professionals; Organizational commitment (OC); Positive emotions (PE); Positive psychology; Psychological well-being; Sense of purpose (SP); Well-being; Work-life balance (WLB)","Construction; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Project management; Surveys; Construction professionals; Organizational Commitment; Positive emotion; Positive emotions; Positive psychology; Psychological well-being; Sense of purpose; Well being; Work-life balance; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128478902

Understanding and visualizing the interaction and tradeoff among space, time, and workforce is critical for construction managers to schedule and deliver projects on time. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to investigate how the critical path method (CPM) and Takt-time planning methods utilize space, time, and workforce differently, develop a tool to visualize the space-time-workforce interactions, and investigate the space-time-workforce tradeoff based on different managers' preferences. This research selected a high-rise office building project and collected 889 sets of productivity data of five specialty trades. The research built a simulation model to investigate productivity and project performance under 267 scenarios of different combinations of the three resources. A dynamic tool was then developed to visualize workspace, time, and workforce interactions. Finally, a Choquet integral-based evaluation and decision tool was developed. The simulation results show that the Takt-time planning method can reduce up to 80% of workspace overlap compared with the actual production plan with less than 20% of duration extension. The contributions to the body of knowledge are (1) creating a visual framework for managers to understand the interaction and tradeoff among space, time, and workforce quickly and accurately, and (2) developing an innovative Choquet integral approach for managers to evaluate planning strategies according to project preferences. The framework and analysis method can be adapted to other construction projects to assist managers to visualize and optimize the space-time-workforce tradeoff under uncertain project drivers. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Choquet integral; Decision support; Project scheduling; Resource tradeoff","Integral equations; Managers; Office buildings; Production control; Productivity; Scheduling; Turnaround time; Choquet integral; Construction manager; Construction scheduling; Construction sites; Decision supports; Planning method; Project scheduling; Resource tradeoffs; Spacetime; TAKT time; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128256073

The Petén department is home to the Maya Biosphere Reserve, which is a 2-million-hectare tropical forest that contains forest concession areas managed by forest-dwelling communities living in and near the reserve. The forest concessions provide concession members with employment opportunities in forestry and tourism as well as the opportunity to profit from timber and non-timber forest product sales of products sustainably harvested from the concession. Members are then responsible for protecting the forest resources within their concession and abiding by Forest Stewardship Council regulations. We examine household characteristics of migrants from within the Petén as well as outside of the Petén department using a 2017 survey of forest-dwelling communities in and near the Maya Biosphere Reserve to determine whether concession members are more likely to have migrated into the reserve than non-concession member households. The results show that concession members are less likely to be migrants, which suggests that, although the concessions create opportunities in forestry and tourism sector, migration is not drive by the prospect of obtaining concession membership. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Community-based forest management; Deforestation; Forest conservation; Maya biosphere reserve; Migration","Biospherics; Deforestation; Housing; Timber; Biosphere reserve; Community-based forest managements; Employment opportunities; Forest concessions; Forest conservation; Guatemala; Managed forest; Maya biosphere reserve; Migration; Tropical forest; Conservation; Characteristics; Conservation; Deforestation; Employment; Forestry; Guatemala; Migration; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128209150

[INFORMS J. Comput., 2020] to capture a multitude of applications, ranging from appointment scheduling in hospitals, restaurants, and fitness centers to product recommendations in e-commerce settings. In this problem, the purchasing dynamics of customers sequentially unfold over T stages. Within each stage, the retailer selects an assortment of products to make available for purchase with the intent of maximizing expected revenue. However, motivated by practical applications, the caveat is that each product can be offered in at most one stage. Moving from one stage to the next, the customer either purchases one of the currently offered products according to MNL preferences and leaves the system or decides not to make any purchase at that time. In the former scenario, the retailer gains a product-associated revenue; in the latter scenario, the customer progresses to the next stage or eventually leaves the system once all T stages have been traversed. We focus our attention on the most general formulation of this problem, in which purchasing decisions are governed by a stage-dependent MNL choice model, reflecting the notion that customers’ preferences may change from stage to stage because of updated perceptions, patience waning over time, etc. Concurrently, we consider a more structured formulation in which purchasing decisions are stage-invariant, utilizing a single MNL model across all stages. Our main contribution comes in the form of a strongly polynomial-time approximation scheme for both formulations of the sequential assortment problem in their utmost generality. We provide evidence for the practical relevance of these theoretical findings through extensive numerical experiments. Finally, we fit our sequential model to historical search data from Expedia’s hotel booking platform. We observe substantial gains in fitting accuracy when our model is benchmarked against other well-known choice models designed for the setting at hand.

Leveraging the existing but fragmented multi-source data, four components of industrial bioenergy development were integrated into the framework including spatial statistical analysis of biomass feedstock and bioenergy production, machine learning-based suitability assessment, bioenergy plant sites identification and ranking, and socio-economic impacts assessment. A case study was conducted for forest biomass to pellet fuel in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. Our results indicate that the great potential of forest biomass with high variation at the county level is primarily clustered in western Pennsylvania and eastern North Carolina. Integrating the datasets of biomass feedstock, road conditions, employment status, income status, population, and current bioenergy production, the machine-learning model demonstrates good performance for bioenergy industry suitability assessment, with the high-suitable areas accounting for 19.76%, medium-suitable areas for 34.74%, and low-suitable areas for 54.49% in the region. Forest biomass availability and distance to major roads are the two top factors affecting bioenergy industry development. We identified 65 industrial sites within the suitable areas and their rankings were derived as a reference of the bioenergy development priority. The socio-economic impacts assessment indicates that the one-year construction of a medium-size pellet fuel facility (75,000 dry tons/year) could create 127 jobs, $8.78 million of labor income, while the operation could create 202 jobs, $10.52 million of labor income, $14.66 million of value-added, and $33.61 million of output in total per year for the state-level economy. © 2022","Bioenergy; Economic impacts; Forest biomass; Holistic framework; Machine learning; Suitability assessment","Economic and social effects; Feedstocks; Forestry; Machine components; Machine learning; Pelletizing; Analysis frameworks; Bio-energy; Biomass feedstock; Data driven; Economic impacts; Forest biomass; Holistic analysis; Holistic frameworks; Industrial development; Suitability assessment; Biomass; alternative energy; bioenergy; biomass power; economic impact; energy resource; holistic approach; industrial development; machine learning; resource development; socioeconomic impact; article; bioenergy; biomass; economic aspect; employment status; forest; industrialization; machine learning; North Carolina; Pennsylvania; United States; Mid-Atlantic States; North Carolina; Pennsylvania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127044440

Many real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, traffic signals, and industrial automation can now be trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. These applications are designed to take benefit of DRL in order to improve the monitoring as well as measurements in industrial internet of things for automation identification system. The complexity of these environments means that it is more appropriate to use multi-agent systems rather than a single-agent. However, in non-stationary environments multi-agent systems can suffer from increased number of observations, limiting the scalability of algorithms. This study proposes a model to tackle the problem of scalability in DRL algorithms in transportation domain. A partition-based approach is used in the proposed model to reduce the complexity of the environment. This partition-based approach helps agents to stay in their working area. This reduces the complexity of the learning environment and the number of observations for each agent. The proposed model uses generative adversarial imitation learning and behavior cloning, combined with a proximal policy optimization algorithm, for training multiple agents in a dynamic environment. We present a comparison of PPO, soft actor-critic, and our model in reward gathering. Our simulation results show that our model outperforms SAC and PPO in cumulative reward gathering and dramatically improved training multiple agents. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Behavior cloning; Deep reinforcement learning; Dynamic environment; Multi-agents; Scalability","algorithm; Internet; machine learning; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126230729

The models account for the requirement to earn return fast and to generate a certain return with high probability. The models take the form of static (waterfall) and dynamic (agile) disjunctive integer nonconvex chance-constrained problems. To make the models computationally tractable, we devise model strengthening approaches and decomposition methods. We also develop an algorithm to obtain an ideal investment plan that provides the targeted probabilistic return as quickly as possible whilst maximizing the excess return. Using a representative US-based software company data, we show the significance of the benefits given by the ideal plan. Our results show that the probabilistic return can be reached faster under the agile, as compared to the waterfall, approach. This can partially explain why agile approaches are popular in new product development. Counterintuitively, the results show that the agile approach, which includes more stochasticity sources than the waterfall approach, leads to less uncertainty regarding the time to reach a certain return than the waterfall approach. The reason for this outcome is the dynamic abandoning and re-starting of new projects protecting from downside risks, and hence, from outcomes that would result in longer time to reach the required return level. Furthermore, we introduce a visualization tool to guide a venture capitalist's investment. The visualization tool highlights the company's performance regions derived with the proposed models. The numerical tests show that the developed models are robust and computationally tractable and can be used for larger problems, with more projects, time periods, and uncertainties. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic chance constraint; Ideal plan; New product development; Project portfolio selection; Stochastic programming","Investments; Product development; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Agile approaches; Chance constraint; Data driven; Dynamic chance constraint; Ideal plan; New product development; Probabilistics; Project portfolio selection; Selection decisions; Visualization tools; Stochastic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125487213

This paper examines the neighborhood scale effects on the performance of land loss models in coastal Louisiana where Lower Mississippi River Basin is located. The study incorporates both natural and human variables and their corresponding neighborhood scale variables into land loss modeling. Semivariogram analysis was used to determine each explanatory variable’s neighborhood size at which the semivariance between sample points begins to level off. A new ‘neighborhood’ variable for each of those variables detected with a neighborhood size was created using the focal statistics to represent the neighborhood scale effects. Two land loss stepwise regression models, one without neighborhood variables and the other with neighborhood variables, were developed to test if incorporating neighborhood scale effects could improve the land loss model performance. Results show that the model’s overall accuracy improved significantly from 65.43 to 74.43% after including the neighborhood variables. Six neighborhood variables, in addition to 14 original variables, were selected as significant predictors of land loss probability. The six neighborhood variables include distance to the coastline, land fragmentation, oil and gas well density, percent of water area, pipeline density, and percent of the vacant house. The analysis shows that including variables representing the scale effects are critical for better performance in land loss modeling. Study findings add new insights into the complex land loss mechanism and help derive more accurate land loss predictions to inform coastal restoration and management decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coastal Louisiana; Neighborhood scale; Spatial autocorrelation; Sustainability; Variogram","decision making; reliability analysis; sustainability; variogram; Mississippi Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124377608

Instead, host-country-specific factors characterising the local industrial eco-system drive robotisation in the components supply segment of the automotive value chain more than in its assembly segment.

Often practitioners and policymakers want to predict outcomes of an entire time horizon in the future instead of just a single k-step ahead prediction. These series, apart from their own possible nonlinear dependence, are often also influenced by many external predictors. In this article, we construct prediction intervals of time-aggregated forecasts in a high-dimensional regression setting. Our approach is based on quantiles of residuals obtained by the popular LASSO routine. We allow for general heavy-tailed, long-memory, and nonlinear stationary error processes and stochastic predictors. Through a series of systematically arranged consistency results, we provide theoretical guarantees of our proposed quantile-based method in all of these scenarios. After validating our approach using simulations, we also propose a novel bootstrap-based method that can boost the coverage of the theoretical intervals. Finally analyzing the EPEX Spot data, we construct prediction intervals for hourly electricity prices over horizons spanning 17 weeks and contrast them to selected Bayesian and bootstrap interval forecasts. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bootstrap; electricity prices; Forecasting; heavy-tailed distribution; long-range dependence; time-aggregation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121675152

Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and boundaries in the context of the “Doughnut theory”. We present some key attributes that qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem; it is focused on advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success; and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area. Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines, (ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing social objectives. © 2021 International Institute of Forecasters","Ecological ceiling; Forecasting; Social foundation; Social good; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103701509

Our evidence suggests the inefficiency of externally-advised REITs has diminished in recent years, and the structure is no longer strictly inferior.

For the long-term evaluation of this creative sector, numerous intricate sustainability components, such as environmental, social, and financial, are necessary. The study focuses on long-term sustainability considerations in the supply chain in the construction sector. This work aims to address this information and examine sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research in the construction sector in this manner. More than 95 publications were studied from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021 using both in-depth content analysis and bibliometric methodologies. Several issues of SSCM in construction have been found including environmental, economic and social patterns which are most commonly known as the triple bottom line, typically enhanced by artificial intelligence. Many challenges were discovered including inefficiencies in the logistics system and a shortage of funding, environmental issues in demolition procedures and difficulties in applying sustainability measures due to high skill, data, and time requirements. The article offers a broad list of potentials for improving the current situation in the construction sector by using various types of supply chains such as increasing investment in energy conservation and emission reduction technologies to drive sustainable development, establishing strong green supply chain relationships, and forming a Covid-19 financial support group for small construction companies among other things. The study’s findings suggested that due to the significance of long-term relationships between construction companies, suppliers and customers, smart technology could make it simpler to reach every supply chain link. After an exhaustive literature review 59 research questions were formulated for the future research. In the future, the importance of these questions could be determined using expert questionnaires and multi-criteria evaluation. © 2022 The Author(s).","construction industry; construction supply chain; logistics; research questions; supply chain management; sustainable construction; systematic review","Digital storage; Emission control; Investments; Supply chain management; Surveys; Sustainable development; Construction sectors; Construction supply chain; Creatives; Long-term evaluation; Long-term sustainability; Research questions; Sustainability considerations; Sustainable construction; Sustainable supply chains; Systematic Review; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136333707

However, the role of temperature on the quality of decisions made in real-world settings it is not well-understood. A strand of literature in financial markets has attempted to explore this, but the results have been inconclusive: some studies suggest that temperature does not affect financial decisions, whilst others reach contrasting conclusions-some suggesting that higher, and others that lower temperatures, reduce the quality and economic value of financial decisions. We design an empirical experiment to overcome the limitations of previous studies in order to shed new light on the role of temperature in financial decisions. The study employs data from a time-limited market for state-contingent assets, namely an event-driven prediction market. We assess the extent to which prediction market participants’ subjective judgments of event probabilities deviate from the actual probability of the event occurring, as a result of temperature-induced cognitive errors and risk-taking. The results demonstrate that higher temperatures are associated with lower decision quality. We also found that temperature differentially influences the decisions of those with different decision profiles, with the largest influence observed on individuals whose decisions are based on logic, objectivity and skilful cognitive evaluations of alternatives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Betting market; Decision bias; Forecasting; Risk taking; Weather effect","Behavioral research; Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Betting market; Cognitive error; Decision bias; Financial decisions; Prediction markets; Real world setting; Risk preference; Risk taking; Time limited; Weather effect; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118560759

Producing FC with conventional technology and without the additional processing steps of food-grade sugar can result in a low-cost industrial-grade fermentable sugar that is competitive with that of raw sugar. This study assesses the minimum selling prices (MSP) and the life cycle environmental impacts of FC produced from energycane, sweet sorghum, sugar beet, and corn all of which are grown in the US. The study also assesses FC produced from sugarcane grown in Brazil, which is used as a gauging reference of a low-cost FC source. The MSP was determined by calculating the prices of FC that will result in a net present value (NPV) of 0 with a discount rate that is better than that of a low-risk investment. Environmental performance was assessed by accounting for the life cycle emissions of greenhouse gas, use of fossil energy, and eutrophication potential. The MSP of FC produced from the evaluated feedstocks varies from $0.30 kg−1 for FC produced from sugarcane to $0.50 kg−1 for FC produced from sugar beet or sweet sorghum. The study shows that in the US, FC from energycane has a similar MSP of $0.40 kg−1 to that of FC from corn at $0.38 kg−1, but FC from energycane has lower environmental impacts than FC from corn. The potential for economic feasibility exists in the US for FC from energycane, and with similar environmental impacts to sugarcane and lower environmental impacts than corn. Opportunities for a lower MSP of $0.32 kg−1 exist by using sweet sorghum as a supplementary feedstock with energycane to increase the utilization of the processing plant and reduce the capital cost per unit mass of FC. Producing FC in the US from energycane and supplementing it with sweet sorghum results in an MSP that is lower than raw sugar, which varied from $0.20 kg−1 to $0.63 kg−1 and averaged $0.35 kg−1 from years 2005 through 2019. This shows that the US has access to a low-cost source of FC with lower environmental impacts than corn and with a price that is not subjected to external factors like the fluctuating price of raw sugar. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Energycane; Life cycle assessment; Minimum selling price; Sugars; Sweet sorghum","Biofuels; Carbohydrates; Chemicals; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Sugar beets; Bio-based; Commodity chemicals; Economic feasibilities; Energycane; Environmental performance; Fermentable carbohydrate; Low-costs; Minimum selling price; Selling prices; Sweet sorghum; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127960985

Multiple techniques were used to mitigate common method bias, including multiple survey responses per firm sampled, confirmatory factor analysis with Chi-square and Harman’s test of common method bias. We find automation generally lends itself to improving aspects of green supply chains regardless of global location of firms. With increasing automation levels, supply chain efficiency improves, thereby improving economic performance.

This study examines whether leveraging omnichannel data can lead to, statistically and economically, significantly better predictions on consumers’ online path-to-purchase journeys, given the intrinsic fluidity in and heterogeneity brought forth by the digital transformation of traditional marketing. Using an omnichannel data set that captures consumers’ online behavior in terms of their website browsing trajectories and their offline behavior in terms of physical location trajectories, we predict consumers’ future path-to-purchase journeys based on their historical omnichannel behaviors. Using a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, we find that using omnichannel data can significantly improve our model’s predictive power. The lift curve analysis reveals that the omnichannel model outperforms the corresponding single-channel model by 7.38%. This enhanced predictive power benefits various heterogeneous online firms, regardless of their size, offline presence, mobile app availability, or whether they are selling single- or multicategory products. Using an illustrative example of targeted marketing, we further quantify the economic value of the improved predictive power using a cost-revenue analysis.

However, not all the firms plan on a big spend on social media marketing. Our stylized model investigates the strategic effects of social media marketing spending (SMM spending) with the presence of exogenous quality revelation through sources over which firms have no direct control. Unlike traditional advertising, social media marketing has two roles: awareness enhancement and information revelation. Consumers are heterogeneous in their awareness of the product (e.g., whether they know the existence of the product). Our analysis yields three main findings. First, our results show the existence of a separating equilibrium and a partial-pooling equilibrium where the high-/low-quality firms pool together and spend less on social media marketing than the mid-quality firm. Intuitively, the high-quality firm gets enough quality transparency from background user-generated discussions, and the cost of maintaining a social presence outweighs the benefits. The low-quality firm avoids social media marketing because quality transparency is broadly detrimental, whereas the midtier firm is just right to benefit from social media discussions they encourage. Second, we also find that in the partial-pooling equilibrium, as the fraction of aware consumers increases, the mid-quality firm spends less on social media marketing, whereas its optimal spending on social media marketing first decreases, and then increases with the precision of the external information signal. Third, by comparing these two equilibria, we show that if the partial-pooling equilibrium survives the intuitive criterion, it Pareto-dominates the separating equilibrium. © 2022 INFORMS","game theory; marketing strategy; quality signaling; social media marketing","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Marketing; Quality control; Social networking (online); Strategic planning; Transparency; Advertizing; Business strategy; Direct control; Information revelation; Integral part; Low qualities; Marketing strategy; Quality signaling; Social media marketings; Strategic effect; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134678450

The data we use is a large-scale customer traffic data set, collected through AI-chip-embedded sensors, across 25 malls over a two-year period, and we combine it with detailed campaign information for our analyses. We classify the campaigns into five categories based on the approach and timing of the campaigns. We then develop an innovative interpretable machine learning model, named generalized additive neural network model (GANNM), to accurately learn the response curves for different marketing campaigns. The response curves characterize the impact of campaign budget on customer traffic. We demonstrate that this new model has better predictive accuracy compared with current interpretable models and also yields additional business insights. We find that campaigns with experience incentives lead to larger increases in customer traffic than campaigns with sales incentives only, and the contrast is more significant for campaigns in off-peak periods. In addition, malls can piggyback on online promotion events and boost customer traffic with campaigns held at the same time. We further demonstrate that the optimized budget allocation based on the response curves learned by GANNM yields a 11.2% increase in customer traffic overall, compared with 3.2% achieved by a baseline with preassumed functional forms of response curves and 1.0% achieved by a post hoc explanation method. Overall, our proposed model provides more accurate estimations for response curves and presents interpretable and actionable insights for managers. © 2021 INFORMS","interpretable machine learning; mall customer traffic; marketing campaigns; response curve evaluation","Budget control; Commerce; Curve fitting; Neural network models; Sales; Budget allocation; Generalized additives; Interpretable machine learning; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mall customer traffic; Marketing campaign; Neural network model; Response curve evaluation; Response curves; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134677857

This paper employs a design science approach and proposes a new composite metric, eigen attention centrality (EAC), as a proxy for information flows associated with a node that considers both attention to a node and coattention with other nodes in a network. We apply the EAC metric in the context of financial market where nodes are individual stocks and edges are based on coattention relationships among stocks. Composite information from different channels is used to measure attention and coattention. To evaluate the effectiveness of the EAC metric on predicting outcomes, we conduct an in-depth performance evaluation of the EAC metric by (1) using multiple linear and nonlinear prediction methods and (2) comparing EAC with a benchmark model without EAC and models with a set of alternative network metrics. Our analysis shows that EAC significantly outperforms other measures in predicting the direction and magnitude of abnormal returns of stocks. Besides, our EAC specification has better predictive performance than alternative specifications, and EAC outperforms direct attention in predicting abnormal returns. Using the EAC metric, we derive a stock portfolio and develop a trading strategy that provides significant and positive excess returns. Lastly, we find that composite information has significantly better predictive performance than separate information sources, and such superior performance owes to information from social media instead of traditional media. © 2021 INFORMS","attention; coattention; Eigen attention centrality; information flow; network analysis; network structure; return prediction","Benchmarking; Commerce; Financial markets; Social networking (online); Specifications; Abnormal returns; Attention; Coattention; Eigen attention centrality; Flows in networks; Information flows; Network structures; Predictive performance; Return prediction; Social media; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134654663

The success of the model is predicated on the ability to profitably convert free users to paying ones. Price promotions (or “sales”) are often used in freemium to induce this conversion. However, the causal effect of exposing consumers to such inter-temporal price variation is unclear. While sales can generate beneficial short-run conversion, they may be harmful in the long-run if consumers inter-temporally substitute purchases to periods with low prices, or use them as signals of low product quality. These long-run concerns may be accentuated in freemium apps, where the base version is sold for free, so that sales form extreme price cuts on the overall product combination. We work with the seller of a free-to-play video game to randomize entering cohorts of users into treatment and control conditions in which promotions for in-game purchases are turned on or off. We observe complete user behavior for half a year, including purchases and consumption of in-game goods, which, in contrast to much of the extant literature, enables us to assess possible substitution over time in consumption directly. We find that conversion and revenue improve in the treatment group; and detect no evidence of harmful inter-temporal substitution or negative inferences about quality from exposure to price variation, suggesting that promotions are profitable. We conjecture that the zero price of the base product that makes its consumption virtually costless, combined with the complementarity between the base product and premium features can help explain this. To the extent that this holds across freemium contexts, the positive effects of promotions documented here may hold more generally. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","App monetization; Field experiments; Free-to-play games; Freemium; Price promotions; Pricing; Sales; Video games",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134181308

Key decisions in such markets are not only how much to advertise in each segment over time but also when to enter the follower segment. We develop a continuous-time optimal control model to examine these issues. Analysis yields two sets of two-point boundary value problems where one set has an unknown boundary value condition that satisfies an algebraic equation. A fast solution methodology is proposed. Two main insights emerge. First, the optimal advertising strategy can be U-shaped, that is, decreasing at first to free-ride peer influence but increasing later on to thwart the repulsion influence of overpopularity causing disadoption. Second, in markets where cross-segment repulsion triggers disadoption, advertising is only moderately effective, and entry costs are high, managing both advertising and entry timing can result in significantly higher profits than managing only one of these levers. In markets without disadoption, with high advertising effectiveness or with low entry costs, in contrast, delaying entry may add little value if one already manages advertising optimally. This implies that purveyors of prestige or cool products need not deny followers access to their products in order to protect their profits, and can use advertising to speed up the democratization of consumption profitably. © 2021 INFORMS","advertising; diversity and inclusion; entry timing; marketing strategy; new products; optimal control; peer influence","Boundary value problems; Commerce; Continuous time systems; Profitability; Timing circuits; Advertizing; Diversity and inclusion; Entry Costs; Entry timing; Marketing strategy; New product; Optimal advertisings; Optimal controls; Peer influence; Timing decisions; Marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133325446

Focusing on the risk induced by partisan politics, we measure political hedging as the degree to which firms’ political connections are balanced across Republican and Democratic candidates. We find that greater political hedging is associated with reduced stock return volatility, particularly during periods of higher policy uncertainty. Similarly, greater political hedging is associated with reduced crash risk, investment volatility, and earnings volatility. Moreover, the reduction in earnings volatility appears to relate to both a firm’s taxes and its operating activities, as we find that greater political hedging is associated with reduced cash effective tax rate volatility and pretax income volatility. We further find investors are better able to anticipate future earnings for firms that engage in political hedging, suggesting that political hedging helps improve firms’ information environments. Lastly, we perform an event study using President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. We find that on the days this policy proposal was debated in Congress, energy and utility firms experienced heightened intraday return volatility (relative to other firms and nonevent days). However, this heightened volatility is mitigated for energy and utility firms that are more politically hedged. Overall, we conclude that political hedging is an effective risk management tool that helps mitigate firm risk.

We build a dynamic model of a manager who uses limited financial resources to simultaneously repay a creditor and motivate a worker. If the manager can divert or misuse revenue, then debt makes the manager less willing to follow through on promised rewards, leading to low worker effort. In profit-maximizing equilibria, the firm prioritizes repaying its debts, leading to gradual increases in effort and wages. These dynamics can persist even after debts have been fully repaid. Consistent with this analysis, we document that a firm’s financial leverage is negatively related to measures of employee morale, wages, and productivity.

This paper analyzes a broad set of factors associated with the risks and rewards from entry into new-to-the-researcher scientific fields, including individual capacities and preferences as well as incentives stemming from career progression and access to funding. Using a panel of researchers in biomedical sciences and science and engineering from a large European research university, we find that productivity affects new field entry as such but is not associated with entry into fields that are very distant to one's current expertise. Scientists in more senior ranks, with larger co-author networks and collaborating with PhD students, are more likely to enter new fields, but these factors do not represent an additional push to enter very remote fields. Such ""long jumps""are more likely to be made by above-average talented rather than merely productive researchers. Finally, accounting for its endogeneity, we find that funding does not make new field entry more likely. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"decision making; panel data; research; student; university sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132855877

This paper investigates the relevance of those policy actions to the ubiquitous use of fiat money tokens which in addition to meeting public expenditure and paying taxes also facilitate transactions in the economy. A parsimonious model of the macroeconomic system subsuming the prevalent fiscal and monetary interventions is developed and experimented with to explore alternative policy levers for funding public expenditure and controlling money supply. A novel dynamic control regimen to regulate taxation and open market operations for controlling inflation is pro-posed. It is shown that while the public spending can be entirely met through new money creation, taxation and open market operations must be used as inflation control instruments, whereas expenditure instruments can be used to alleviate the regressivity of taxation regimen. © 2022 by the authors.

Our analysis is based on a representative sample of Irish dairy farms, ranging from 2000 to 2018, which includes a period of major change in EU dairy policy. Based on a multi-input multi-output production system, we first estimate technical, allocative, scale and scope efficiencies. We find significant heterogeneity in technical and allocative efficiencies, which change over time. We also calculate shadow prices of milk quota, which suggest that milk quotas restricted many farmers and limited their ability to produce milk. Finally, we explore determinants of technical, allocative, scale and overall inefficiencies using random panel-data censored regression. We find that subsidies are positively associated with farm efficiency, but the effects vary over distinct quota abolition periods. Overall, our empirical findings indicate that agricultural policy had important effects on the managerial effectiveness of farmers. © 2022 The Authors.

Assuming that the predictors affect the response through the latent factors, we propose to first conduct factor analysis and then apply sufficient dimension reduction on the estimated factors to derive the reduced data for subsequent forecasting. Using directional regression and the inverse third-moment method in the stage of sufficient dimension reduction, the proposed methods can capture the nonmonotone effect of factors on the response. We also allow a diverging number of factors and only impose general regularity conditions on the distribution of factors, avoiding the undesired time reversibility of the factors by the latter. These make the proposed methods fundamentally more applicable than the sufficient forecasting method of Fan et al. (2017). The proposed methods are demonstrated both in simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting monthly macroeconomic data from 1959 to 2016. Also, our theory contributes to the literature of sufficient dimension reduction, as it includes an invariance result, a path to perform sufficient dimension reduction under the high-dimensional setting without assuming sparsity, and the corresponding order-determination procedure. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This exploratory case study examined how four triads of chemistry faculty and their doctoral students recruited from three research universities in the eastern United States engaged in ethical decision-making on issues of authorship, assignment of credit, and plagiarism. A mixed-methods approach involving the administration of an online survey consisting of three open-ended case studies followed by a think-aloud interview was utilized. Participants were found to use analogical reasoning and base their decision-making on a common core set of considerations including fundamental principles, social contracts, consequences, and discussion with an advisor, often using prior personal experiences as sources. Co-authorship did not appear to impact the doctoral students' ethical decision-making. Gender may play a role in graduate students' decision-making; female doctoral students appeared to be less likely to consider prior experiences when evaluating the vignettes. Graduate students' lack of knowledge of the core issues in the responsible conduct of research, coupled with their lack of research experience, and inability to identify the core considerations may lead them to make bad judgments in specific situations. Our findings help explain the minimal impact that the current responsible conduct of research training methods has had on graduate students' ethical decision-making and should lead to the development of more effective approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Analogical reasoning; Authorship; Chemistry faculty; Doctoral students; Ethical decision-making; Research ethics; Responsible conduct of research","decision making; female; human; morality; student; United States; university; writing; Authorship; Decision Making; Faculty; Female; Humans; Morals; Students; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131247393

We draw on inventory theory and resource-based theories to hypothesize about the effect of supplier inventory leanness on a focal firm's financial performance and how supplier and focal firm inventory leanness interact to affect such outcomes. We test our hypotheses using a large panel dataset of supplier-focal firm relationships obtained from Compustat's Customer Segment database and aggregated to the focal firm-quarter level, as well as firm financial information from Compustat's Fundamentals Quarterly database. The econometric analyses provide evidence that supplier inventory leanness influences focal firm financial performance indirectly through the interaction with the firm's own inventory leanness. In particular, our estimation results detail how supplier inventory leanness affects the non-linearity of the focal firm's inventory leanness-financial performance relationship and its optimal inventory leanness level.

We deploy generalized panel data stochastic frontier methods, which allow us to decompose time invariant heterogeneity into both vessel specific heterogeneity and persistent inefficiency. This type of decomposition has recently seen interest in a variety of applied production settings but marks the first use in fishery studies. Our main findings show that roughly 20% of red snapper fleet size could have harvested the entire red snapper quota and that the time-varying technical efficiency of the red snapper fleet grew by 6% post-IFQ. We also find that 57% of the Gulf reef fish IFQ fishery (red snapper combined with grouper-tilefish), had it operated at full efficiency, could have harvested the quota in the early stages of the IFQ program (2011–2016), and that the time-varying technical efficiency of the fleet rose by 5% post-IFQ. “The views and opinions provided or implied in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of NOAA”.“The views and opinions provided or implied in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of NOAA”. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",,"Efficiency; Fish; Reefs; Stochastic systems; Fleet sizes; Gulf of Mexico; Over capacity; Panel data; Reef fishes; Stochastic frontier; Technical efficiency; Time invariants; Time varying; Fisheries; coral reef; decomposition analysis; fishery management; fishing vessel; heterogeneity; panel data; technical efficiency; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129601558

It is argued that most of these weaknesses stem from failing to distinguish between statistical and substantive adequacy and secure the former before assessing the latter. The paper untangles the statistical from the substantive premises of inference to delineate the above-mentioned issues and propose solutions. The discussion revolves around a typical DSGE model using US quarterly data. It is shown that this model is statistically misspecified, and when respecified to arrive at a statistically adequate model gives rise to the Student’s t VAR model. This statistical model is shown to (i) provide a sound basis for testing the DSGE overidentifying restrictions as well as probing the identifiability of the deep parameters, (ii) suggest ways to meliorate its substantive inadequacy, and (iii) give rise to reliable forecasts and policy simulations. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the valuable data buried in these documents are not being fully exploited due to their unstructured nature. Domain-specific semantics are needed to facilitate analysis of the data based on content and domain-specific meaning and to bridge terminology gaps across different sources. To address this need, this paper proposes a bridge ontology (BridgeOnto) that captures deterioration knowledge and semantics related to bridge elements, deficiencies, deficiency causes, and maintenance actions. The proposed ontology was evaluated through answering competency questions, automated consistency and redundancy checking, expert interviews, and application-oriented validation. The BridgeOnto was implemented in supporting automated extraction of information describing bridge conditions and maintenance actions from bridge inspection reports. The experimental results show that the ontology was able to improve information extraction precision, recall, and F-1 measure by 11.7%, 12.4%, and 12.0%, on average. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by offering an ontology that can capture the key deterioration knowledge areas with sufficient coverage and in-depth classification for achieving adequate support for bridge document analytics. By allowing better access to and use of crucial textual data, this research has the potential to improve the understanding of bridge deterioration and enhance maintenance decisions. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bridge data analytics; Bridge deterioration; Information extraction; Ontology; Semantic modeling","Artificial intelligence; Bridges; Data Analytics; Data mining; Decision making; Deterioration; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Maintenance; Semantics; Bridge data analytic; Bridge deterioration; Bridge ontology; Data analytics; Data-source; Information extraction; Knowledge ontology; Maintenance Action; Ontology's; Semantic modelling; Ontology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127913854

The literature shows that attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions drive compliance behavior and has influenced the creation of a multitude of training programs focused on improving ones' InfoSec behaviors. While automated controls and directly observable technical indicators are generally preferred by InfoSec practitioners, difficult-to-monitor user actions can still compromise the effectiveness of automatic controls. For example, despite prohibition, doubtful or skeptical employees often increase organizational risk by using the same password to authenticate corporate and external services. Analysis of network traffic or device configurations is unlikely to provide evidence of these vulnerabilities but responses to well-designed surveys might. Guided by the relatively new IPAM model, this study administered 96 survey items from the Behavioral InfoSec literature, across three separate points in time, to 217 respondents. Using systematic feature selection techniques, manageable subsets of 29, 20, and 15 items were identified and tested as predictors of non-compliance with security policy. The feature selection process validates IPAM's innovation in using nuanced self-efficacy and planning items across multiple time frames. Prediction models were trained using several ML algorithms. Practically useful levels of prediction accuracy were achieved with, for example, ensemble tree models identifying 69% of the riskiest individuals within the top 25% of the sample. The findings indicate the usefulness of psychometric items from the behavioral InfoSec in guiding training programs and other cybersecurity control activities and demonstrate that they are promising as additional inputs to AI models that monitor networks for security events. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify top factors to transform towards the green deployment of LSS projects as an untapped phenomenon for scholars and practitioners. A survey questionnaire was distributed globally to collect the data from LSS practitioners and consultants followed by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a statistical dimension reduction method via Statistical Package for Social sciences (SPSS) software. New dimensions for critical success factors (CSFs), critical failure factors (CFFs) and barriers, and motivators were revealed to recommend top factors for green LSS project deployment. In addition to some factors similar to green LSS integration for green outcomes, we found some new factors suggested for green deployment of LSS projects. However, scarcity was also found in green LSS deployment for practitioners and scholars. Further in-depth studies including case studies could be conducted to assess the negative environmental impact of LSS projects. This study serves as an initial call for managers, consultants and research scholars to favour the sustainable deployment of LSS projects in manufacturing alongside the use of traditional approaches with a focus on costs, quality and delivery. This is the first study exposing the possibility of a paradigm shift in environmental sustainability integration with LSS project deployment in manufacturing operations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental sustainability; Green manufacturing; Lean six sigma; Principal component analysis; Project management","Environmental impact; Industrial research; Lean production; Process monitoring; Project management; Six sigma; Surveys; Sustainable development; Work simplification; Continuous improvement project; Dimension reduction method; Environmental sustainability; Environmentally sustainable manufacturing; Green manufacturing; Lean Six Sigma; New dimensions; Principal-component analysis; Six Sigma programs; Statistical packages; Principal component analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127113915

While deep learning models can handle such data, most of the results from these models are uninterpretable. This greatly limits their value in applications aimed at better understanding multicategory shopping behavior and assisting managerial decision-making. Thus, a new approach is needed to analyze high dimensional consumer shopping data in an efficient and interpretable manner, with the potential to greatly strengthen decision support systems for managers especially at large consumer packaged goods firms and giant retailers. We propose a Bayesian deep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to efficiently capture often complex and multifaceted interrelationships across items in the shopping baskets, in the form of substitute and complementary cross effects (which are observable and controllable) and coincidences (which are not). The benefits of the proposed approach are empirically demonstrated by applying our model to a high dimensional supermarket shopping dataset covering very large numbers of products at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level, households, and shopping trips. We discuss implications for managerial decision-making and identify promising research directions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian deep learning; Consumer multicategory choice modeling; Consumer shopping basket; High dimensional data; Sparsity; Variational autoencoder","Decision making; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Large dataset; Managers; Auto encoders; Bayesian; Bayesian deep learning; Choice model; Consumer multicategory choice modeling; Consumer shopping; Consumer shopping basket; High dimensional data; Multicategory; Sparsity; Variational autoencoder; Clustering algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126352421

The effect of recapitalizations per se is not statistically significant, but they reinforce the positive impact of liquidity interventions.

It provides consumers with useful information while potentially revealing the storyline, that is, spoiling the surprise of what will happen. Prior studies have focused on the impact of spoilers on consumers' experiences through psychological experiments. However, the relationship between spoilers and narrative product sales has rarely been empirically explored. To fill this gap, the current study explores the impact of spoilers on the movie box office revenue and how this impact evolves over time. We collected 279,433 reviews of 465 films on a leading community website in China and constructed a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) model with instrumental variables to empirically examine the spoiler effect in the movie market. Our findings indicate that spoilers have a negative influence on the movie box office revenue. However, this impact is limited to the first 6 days after the movie is released. We also discover that spoilers have a stronger negative effect on narrative-based movies than non-narrative-based movies. Furthermore, eWOM volume and eWOM variance negatively moderate the spoiler effect on the box office revenue, but the moderating effect of eWOM valence is not significant. These findings can deepen movie industry decision makers' and platform providers' understanding of spoilers, helping them devise more feasible eWOM operation strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Box office revenue; eWOM; Movie reviews; Narrative; Spoilers","Decision making; Method of moments; Reviews; Box office; Box office revenue; Digital age; Electronic word of mouth; Movie industry; Movie reviews; Narrative; Psychological experiment; Spoiler; Storylines; Motion pictures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125362706

However, amid increasing housing deficits, investing in sustainable housing is widely perceived as a risky venture among policymakers and potential developers. This study explores the risk factors that hinder sustainable housing in developing economies using Ghana as a case study. Through a comprehensive literature review, a list of 30 risk factors was established and categorized into five thematic groups. These factors and groups were used to conduct a questionnaire survey among professionals in the Ghanaian housing market to assess progress on achieving sustainable development goals in housing and the risk factors that affect these. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) analysis conducted on risk factors revealed that ‘financing-related’ is the most critical risk category followed by ‘procurement-related’, ‘design and construction’, ‘operation and maintenance’ and ‘political-related’ risk factors. By prioritizing the risk categories, the findings apprise policymakers and practitioners of the risk factors that require more attention to achieve sustainable housing development. Additionally, the study stipulates measures for mitigating critical risks and for promoting efficient eminent domain on land, energy efficient retrofitting, transparent procurement, effective contractual strategies and efficient co-production and co-designing for sustainable housing development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Decision analysis; Fuzzy system model; Group decision-making; Multiple criteria evaluation; Risk factors; Sustainable housing","decision making; developing world; fuzzy mathematics; housing; housing conditions; housing market; multicriteria analysis; risk factor; Sustainable Development Goal; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124912738

GS countries are trying to leverage their growing demand for innovative products and services to negotiate the uptake of novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The latter can help such countries further stimulate their economic growth and become influential in dictating policies that could advance global development. However, a misaligned AI-adoption strategy entails the risk of alienating the social, economic, and even cultural requirements of such countries, ultimately leading to the incorporation of technologies not serving the needs of their users. Subsequently, we conduct a study whose goal is to provide guidelines on how to perform a comprehensive analysis of the AI ecosystems in GS countries, to determine their readiness to adopt and utilize beneficially these technologies. For this, we performed a qualitative case study of two GS countries, namely Senegal and Cambodia. The depiction of their AI ecosystems unveiled the need to stimulate their societies (i.e., by media exposure, education, etc.) in discerning the practical effects of AI. However, an impactful AI implementation requires a reciprocated satisfaction of the needs of multiple contributing actors. Finally, particular recommendations are offered at the level of these countries’ academic, industrial, and governmental constitutions, suggesting to focalize their resources in order to better energize (and optimally disperse) their research and entrepreneurial capabilities that could help identify the ways in which AI solutions can be of added-value within the premises of these two countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AI ecosystems; AI readiness; Digital transformation; Global South","Economics; Industrial research; Artificial intelligence ecosystem; Artificial intelligence readiness; Cambodia; Catching-up; Digital transformation; Global south; Growing demand; Industrialisation; Innovative product; Senegal; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122926184

After a review of the articles included, we develop a framework that identifies four perspectives ranging from the more micro to the macro: (a) microlevel conceptual basis of strategy discourse, (b) use of language in strategy work processes in their socio-material and multimodal contexts, (c) use of language and especially narratives in long-term processes of strategic change, and (d) the rhetorical and discursive reconstruction of organizational strategies in their historical contexts. We then move on to offer a set of research opportunities and questions to form an agenda for future research. Managerial Summary: This article takes stock of recent research on the role of language and communication in strategic decision-making and strategy work. The key argument is that we should not treat language merely as a window into other aspects of strategic phenomena but as a central means through which strategies are shaped and made sense of. The paper underscores that language use is a crucial part of strategy work and strategic change—to be taken seriously in its own right in research as well as practice. Another key point is that we need to develop better understanding of the new communication technologies and media that play a key role in contemporary organizations. The new theoretical ideas and methods may also inspire practitioners to develop their communication practices. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","communication; language; practice; process; strategy","C (programming language); Language; Multi-modal; Practice; Practice researches; Process; Strategic changes; Strategic process; Strategy; Strategy process; Work process; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120872251

Examples include sleep trackers, fitness trackers, continuous glucose monitors, and RFID-enabled implants, with many additional biometric or health surveillance applications in development or envisioned. These data are included in growing stockpiles of personal health data (PHI) being mined for insight by health economists, policy analysts, researchers, and health system organizations. Dominant narratives position these highly personal data as valuable resources to transform healthcare, stimulate innovation in medical research, and engage individuals in their health and healthcare. Large tech companies are also increasingly implicated in these areas, through mobile health application sales and data acquisitions. Given the many possible uses and users for PGHD, ensuring privacy, security, and equity of benefits from PGHD will be challenging. This is due in part to disparate regulatory policies and practices across technology firms, health system organizations, and health researchers. Rapid developments with PGHD technologies and the lack of harmonization between regulatory regimes may render existing safeguards to preserve patient privacy and control over their PGHD ineffective, while also failing to guide PGHD-related innovation in socially desirable directions. Using a policy regime lens to explore these challenges, we examine three existing data protection regimes relevant to PGHD in the United States that are currently in tension with one another: federal and state health-sector laws, regulations on data use and reuse for research and innovation, and industry self-regulation of consumer privacy by large tech companies. We argue that harmonization of these regimes is necessary to meet the challenges of PGHD data governance. We next examine emerging governing instruments, identifying three types of structures (organizational, regulatory, technological/algorithmic), which synergistically could help enact needed regulatory oversight while limiting the friction and economic costs of regulation that may hinder innovation. This policy analysis provides a starting point for further discussions and negotiations among stakeholders and regulators to do so. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big tech; Governance; Patient-generated health data; PGHD; Privacy; Regulation","Consumer protection; Data privacy; Economics; Public policy; Big tech; Governance; Health data; Health systems; Patient-generated health data; Privacy; Regulation; Regulatory regime; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119908237

The results of considering inner structure can give further insights into the performance relative to the black-box DEA approach. However, the employment of extreme weights may reduce the informativeness of network DEA evaluation, since it ignores other optimal weights of the evaluation model. This paper concerns using all possible input/output weights in DEA to measure the performance of parallel production systems with considering inner structure. The proposed approach can make performance evaluation less dependent on any specific weights and give more meaningful results. A family of dominance relations has been defined, and we propose ratio-based efficiency analysis models to show how to compute these. One of these dominance relations, namely the R-dominance relation, can reflect the characteristic of the inner parallel structure and can be used to identify benchmarks for DMUs based on subsystems. The ranking intervals of DMUs are calculated based on the acyclic dominance relation, namely the efficiency dominance relation. Our proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to measure performance of Chinese provinces. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Dominance; Parallel production systems; Ranking interval",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119850710

We show how much value-added is diverted from farmers, compared to the benchmark set by the least perishable good. Results indicate that more perishable crops are subject to a greater degree of market power. A subsequent scenario analysis reveals that the redistributive effects of market power based on crop perishability are substantial: smallholders’ farm profitability increase by 18% as crop perishability is reduced by 50%.

Supercenters may influence competing supermarkets’ prices, but their effects on competition between supermarkets’ private labels and manufacturer brands remain poorly understood. This study examines the impact of Wal-Mart Supercenters on supermarkets’ strategic use of private labels and the control they may exercise over the pricing of manufacturer brands. We use a structural model to investigate alternative pricing scenarios in which the supermarkets have varying control over manufacturer-brand retail prices. The analysis is applied to the milk market in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex in an early period of Supercenter growth: 1996–2001. We find that Wal-Mart induces supermarkets to price their private label more competitively and has a very small effect on the pricing of the manufacturer brand. We also identify the type of consumers Wal-Mart Supercenters can attract from supermarkets, leaving incumbents to face a different composition of consumers. Consumers that continue shopping at traditional supermarkets are found to be less price-sensitive, view incumbents as less heterogeneous, and experience the manufacturer brand as more differentiated from private labels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Competition; Private labels; Superstore entry","competition (economics); milk; numerical model; price determination; retailing; shopping activity; supermarket; Dallas; Fort Worth; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115012668

The model consisted of factors screened out by Pearson product–moment correlational coefficient, constructed by a logical reasoning process and then quantified by conducting Bayesian belief networks parameter learning. Findings: The technical aspect of construction project management was less critical while the managerial aspect became more emphasised. Project factors and client factors present relatively weak impact on construction delay, while contractor factors, contractual arrangement factors and distinctively interaction factors present relatively strong impact.

Industry 4.0 technology for logistics processes has been termed Logistics 4.0. Logistics 4.0 and its elements have seen varied conceptualizations in the literature. The literature has mainly focused on conceptual and theoretical studies, which supports the notion that Logistics 4.0 is a relatively young area of research. Refinement of constructs and building consensus perspectives and definitions is necessary for practical and theoretical advances in this area. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a detailed literature review and practitioner focus group interviews, items of Logistics 4.0 for manufacturing enterprises were further validated by using a large-scale survey with practicing experts from organizations located in Central Europe, the Northeastern United States of America and Northern Thailand. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to define a measurement model for Logistics 4.0. Findings: Based on 239 responses the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in nine items and three factors for the final Logistics 4.0 measurement model. It combines “the leveraging of increased organizational capabilities” (factor 1) with “the rise of interconnection and material flow transparency” (factor 2) and “the setting up of autonomization in logistics processes” (factor 3). Practical implications: Practitioners can use the proposed measurement model to assess their current level of maturity regarding the implementation of Logistics 4.0 practices. They can map the current state and derive appropriate implementation plans as well as benchmark against best practices across or between industries based on these metrics.

Since there are many possible reformulations for a given problem, an important question is: Which reformulation leads to the fastest solution time? One approach is to detect a block diagonal structure in the constraint matrix, and reformulate the problem by dualizing the constraints outside of the blocks; the approach is defined herein as block dual decomposition. Main advantage of such a reformulation is that the Lagrangian relaxation has a block diagonal constraint matrix, thus decomposable into smaller sub-problems that can solved in parallel. We show that the block decomposition can critically affect convergence rate of the sub-gradient method. We propose various decomposition methods that use domain knowledge or apply algorithms using knowledge about the structure in the constraint matrix or the dependence in the decision variables, towards reducing the computational effort to solve large-scale optimization problems. In particular, we introduce a block decomposition approach that reduces the number of dualized constraints by utilizing a community detection algorithm. We present empirical experiments on an extensive set of problem instances including a real application. We illustrate that if the number of the dualized constraints in the decomposition increases, the computational effort within each iteration of the sub-gradient method decreases while the number of iterations required for convergence increases. The key message is that it is crucial to employ prior knowledge about the structure of the problem when solving large scale optimization problems using dual decomposition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Block dual decomposition; Community detection; Distributed decision making; Large scale optimization; Parallel subgradient algorithm","Decision making; Domain Knowledge; Gradient methods; Lagrange multipliers; Matrix algebra; Population dynamics; Block dual decomposition; Community detection; Distributed decision making; Distributed-decision makings; Dual decomposition; Large-scale optimization; Optimization problems; Parallel subgradient algorithm; Sub-gradient algorithm; Sub-gradient methods; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121831799

The approach is based on a model that accommodates a set of arbitrary distributions for endogenous variables and interstep intervals and variables. Themodel enables reliable estimation of individual-level parameters by uncovering and statistically pooling clusters of similar individuals. We show that using such amodel one can distribute the response of an outcome variable to an impulse over all possible preceding activity sequences.When a few such sequences explain most of the response, they describe the population's characteristic response paths from the impulse to the outcome. We apply the proposed approach to a customer touchpoint data set from a large multichannel specialty retailer. This application uncovers six customer segments, each with unique characteristic paths to purchase. These paths provide insights into the behavior of customers and the optimal over-time communication strategy for different customer segments. Summary of Contribution: Uncovering users' paths through physical and virtual spaces has been of considerable interest in the computing and operations research domain. The existing research suggests a demand for visualizing the primary paths of agents through geographic, online, and activity spaces. Thus far, most of the research have developed approaches that are unique to specific domains providing insight into the domain in the process. There is a need for a general statistically robust approach that can be applied to a broad range of domains to uncover variable sequences that lead to outcomes of interest.We propose a computational approach to uncover characteristic response paths of a population from an individual-levelmultivariate time series data set. The approach is based on a statistical model that accommodates arbitrary and mixed set of distributions for the endogenous variables, accommodates intersession intervals and variables, and reliably estimates individuals' parameters through statistical pooling by uncovering clusters of similar members. These features make the proposed model suitable for a large variety of real-world datasets. We show that using such a model one can extract characteristic paths over possible activity sequences starting froman impulse leading up to a target variable of interest.

In this framework, the unknown probability distribution is assumed to lie in an ambiguity set consisting of all distributions that are compatible with the available partial information. Although DRO bridges the gap between stochastic programming and robust optimization, one of its limitations is that its models for large-scale problems can be significantly difficult to solve, especially when the uncertainty is of high dimension. In this paper, we propose computationally efficient inner and outer approximations for DRO problems under a piecewise linear objective function and with a moment-based ambiguity set and a combined ambiguity set including Wasserstein distance and moment information. In these approximations, we split a random vector into smaller pieces, leading to smaller matrix constraints. In addition, we use principal component analysis to shrink uncertainty space dimensionality. We quantify the quality of the developed approximations by deriving theoretical bounds on their optimality gap. We display the practical applicability of the proposed approximations in a production-transportation problemand a multiproduct newsvendor problem. The results demonstrate that these approximations dramatically reduce the computational time while maintaining high solution quality. The approximations also help construct an interval that is tight for most cases and includes the (unknown) optimal value for a large-scale DRO problem, which usually cannot be solved to optimality (or even feasibility in most cases). Summary of Contribution: This paper studies an important type of optimization problem, that is, distributionally robust optimization problems, by developing computationally efficient inner and outer approximations via operations research tools. Specifically, we consider several variants of such problems that are practically important and that admit tractable yet large-scale reformulation.

Given a graph G with a set V of nodes and a set E of edges, each node i in V has a weight bi, and a threshold requirement gi.We seek a minimum weight subset T of V, so that every node i not in T is adjacent to at least gi members of T. When gi is one for all nodes, we obtain the weighted dominating set problem. First, we propose a strong and compact extended formulation for the PIDS problem. We then project the extended formulation onto the space of the natural node-selection variables to obtain an equivalent formulation with an exponential number of valid inequalities. Restricting our attention to trees, we show that the extended formulation is the strongest possible formulation, and its projection (onto the space of the node variables) gives a complete description of the PIDS polytope on trees.We derive the necessary and sufficient facet-dening conditions for the valid inequalities in the projection and discuss their polynomial time separation. We embed this (exponential size) formulation in a branch-and-cut framework and conduct computational experiments using real-world graph instances, with up to approximately 2.5million nodes and 8million edges. On a test-bed of 100 real-world graph instances, our approach finds solutions that are on average 0.2% fromoptimality and solves 51 out of the 100 instances to optimality. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

We examine worker turnover as a significant but underrecognized determinant of product reliability. Our study collects and integrates (1) data reporting factory worker staffing and turnover from within a major consumer electronics producer’s supply chain and (2) traceable data reporting the component quality and field failures—that is, replacements and repairs—of nearly 50 million consumer mobile devices over four years of customer usage. Devices are individually traced back to the factory conditions and staffing, down to the assembly line–week, under which they were produced. Despite the manufacturer’s extensive quality control efforts, including stringent testing, each percentage point increase in the weekly rate of workers quitting from an assembly line (its weekly worker turnover) is found to increase field failures by 0.74%–0.79%. In the high-turnover weeks following paydays, eventual field failures are strikingly 10.2% more common than for devices produced during the lowest turnover weeks immediately before paydays. In other weeks, the assembly lines experiencing higher turnover produce an estimated 2%–3% more field failures on average. The associated costs amount to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. We demonstrate that staffing and retaining a stable factory workforce critically underlies product reliability and showcase the value of traceability coupled with connected workplace and product data in supply chain operations.

We also document that the adoption of these laws leads to a reduction in debt ratios, which suggests that firms are able to partially offset the negative effects on operating profitability by adjusting their capital structure. Consistent with theoretical predictions, these effects of anti-discrimination laws are more pronounced for firms in states and cities with a greater proportion of African Americans, firms with high labor intensity, firms in states experiencing high African American migration, and firms in concentrated industries. Some of our evidence suggests that anti-discrimination laws lead to a reduction in statistical discrimination or monopsony power rather than taste-based discrimination. Taken together, our results are supportive of theoretical models of discrimination and show that racial discrimination laws significantly affect firm operating performance and financial policies.

The service is mandatory, but customers can choose between the two variants. Choosing the expedited variant requires enrollment that incurs a fixed cost per period. Customers are strategic and have the same cost of waiting but are heterogeneous in the rate at which they use the service. Academic/practical relevance: The option of expedited security at U.S. airports (TSA PreCheck) is an instance where this problem arises. As has been the case with the PreCheck program, providers that offer expedited service may face criticism from customers, with the main concern being that the diversion of resources to expedited services increases wait time for regular customers. This has important policy implications for the provider, especially a government organization such as the TSA. Existing literature has focused on service differentiation as a means to maximize profit or overall social welfare, but its effect on individual customers has received little attention. Methodology: We find customer's equilibrium decisions for any allocation choice made by the provider. Using the equilibrium result, we solve for the allocation choice that maximizes social welfare. Results: Even when customers behave strategically, an expedited service offered in parallel to a standard service cannot only increase overall welfare, but also do so for each customer individually. We also find that in a scenario where some customers lose out because of the expedited service, improving the efficiency of the expedited service is more effective than decreasing the enrollment cost to help those who are worse off. Managerial implications: The gains from offering expedited service do not have to come at the expense of regular customers. When they do, we provide recommendations for which decision levers are most effective at making the system fair. © 2021 INFORMS","differentiated service; expedited service; fairness; social welfare; strategic queueing","Airport security; Public policy; Differentiated service; Expedited service; Fairness; Fixed cost; Fixed quantity; Problem definition; Regular customers; Service provider; Social welfare; Strategic queueing; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132778067

Academic/ practical relevance: Online shoppers often prefer to return products to stores rather than mailing them back. Many online retailers have recently started to collaborate with location partners to offer the store return option to their customers, and we quantify its economic benefit to a location partner. Methodology: We analyze proprietary data sets from Happy Returns (which provides return services for more than 30 online retailers) and one of its location partners, using a panel difference-in-differences model. In our study, a treatment is the initiation of the return service at each of the location partner’s stores, and an outcome is the store and online channel performance of the location partner. We then explore the mechanisms of underlying customer behavior that drive these outcomes. Results: We find that the partnership increases the number of unique customers, items sold, and net revenue in both store and online channels. We identify two drivers for this improved performance: (1) the location partner acquires new customers in both store and online channels, and (2) existing customers change their shopping patterns only in the store channel after using the return service; in particular, they visit stores more often, purchase more items, and generate higher revenue after their first return service. Managerial implications: To our knowledge, we provide the first direct empirical evidence of value to location partners from a return partnership, and as these partnerships become more prevalent, our findings have important managerial implications for location partners and online retailers alike. © 2021 INFORMS","econometric analysis; empirical research; retailing; service operations","Digital storage; Managers; Sales; Econometric analysis; Empirical research; Managerial implications; Online channels; Performance; Physical stores; Problem definition; Retailing; Service operations; Third parties; Location",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132223563

Academic/practical relevance: We develop a novel approach to estimating lost sales using only sales data, a market share estimate, and an estimate of overall availability. We use the method to illustrate the negative consequences of using potentially inaccurate inventory records as indicators of availability. Methodology: We suggest a partially hidden Markov model of OSA to generate probabilistic choice sets and incorporate these probabilistic choice sets into the estimation of a multinomial logit demand model using a nested expectation-maximization algorithm. We highlight the importance of considering inventory reliability problems first through simulation and then by applying the procedure to a data set from a major U.S. retailer. Results: The simulations show that the method converges in seconds and produces estimates with similar or lower bias than state-of-the-art benchmarks. For the product category under consideration at the retailer, our procedure finds lost sales of around 3.0% compared with 0.2% when relying on the inventory record as an indicator of availability. Managerial implications: The method efficiently computes estimates that can be used to improve inventory management and guide managers on how to use their scarce resources to improve stocking execution. The research also shows that ignoring inventory record inaccuracies when estimating lost sales can produce substantially inaccurate estimates, which leads to incorrect parameters in supply chain planning. © 2021 INFORMS","censored demand; demand estimation; EM algorithm; hidden Markov model; inventory uncertainty; lost sales","Competition; Image segmentation; Inventory control; Managers; Maximum principle; Sales; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Censored demand; Demand estimation; EM algorithms; Hidden-Markov models; Inventory uncertainty; Lost sale; On shelf availabilities; Probabilistic choices; Substitutable products; Uncertainty; Hidden Markov models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132219170

This study investigates whether and how EMS adoption lowers energy efficiency and, if so, how to mitigate the impact. Academic/practical relevance: Understanding the relationship between EMS and energy efficiency is important because any decrease in energy efficiency may eventually lead to undesired environmental outputs (e.g., CO2), potentially contributing to climate change. This study sheds light on energy as a necessary input required for environmental management, thereby elucidating the issue of environmental trade-offs in sustainable operations. Methodology: Using novel panel data on energy efficiency and EMS standards obtained from 2,690 South Korean plants operating between 2001 and 2014, this study empirically investigates the impact of EMS on energy efficiency at the plant level. Results: We provide evidence of a trade-off relationship between environmental performance and energy efficiency in relation to EMS adoption. We find that the adoption of ISO 14001, the representative EMS standard, results in approximately 6%–12% lower energy efficiency compared with nonadoption although it effectively reduces air, water, and waste pollution. More importantly, our results show that the trade-off, an unintended consequence of EMS implementation, can be moderated through quality management capability. Managerial implications: We suggest that sustainability managers take balancing actions to reduce trade-offs between environmental performance and energy efficiency. Specifically, when implementing EMS, managers are advised to (1) actively incorporate energy management activities, (2) employ more comprehensive measurements for energy efficiency, and (3) redesign incentive schemes to facilitate improvements in energy efficiency. © 2022 INFORMS","energy efficiency; environmental management; environmental operations; ISO 14001; quality management; sustainability","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental management systems; Managers; Quality management; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Energy; Environment and energies; Environmental energy; Environmental operations; Environmental performance; ISO 14001; Lower energies; Problem definition; System adoption; Trade off; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132212789

Due to our modela-s computational complexity, it motivates us to adopt variational inequalities theory, which is applied to convert an original model into a new variational inequality problem. On this basis, the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium solution are proved, and a high-efficient Euler algorithm is proposed. A case study focused on the 5G smartphone market is conducted. Numerical results show that firms may obtain more profits by producing products with newer versions if the consumer preference for product functionality is high.

More and more participants share and discuss facts and opinions about projects by posting comments, which can influence investors’ funding decisions. Previous studies have mainly focused on quantity, sentiment, and linguistic features of comments, largely overlooking the value of semantic features, in predicting fundraising success. Rooted in information asymmetry and herding behavior theories, we posit that discovering semantic signals from comments and distinguishing actor roles may benefit fundraising success prediction. We propose a framework with novel latent semantic features of comments.

We find that at the aggregate level, unidirectional causality runs from the total power consumption to economic growth, starting from the second up to the seventh quarter. In the sectoral context, the results are different. Since there is no causality between industrial power consumption and economic growth; therefore, an energy conservation policy can thus be implemented for the industrial sector. Moreover, since a bidirectional causality exists after 15 quarters for the commercial sector, a short-term policy but not an energy conservation policy could also be initiated for this sector. In the industrial and agricultural sectors, a promotional policy should be initiated because a unidirectional causality exists from sectoral power consumption to economic growth. Therefore, different and sector-specific policies would be more appropriate than a single policy for all power sectors in India in order to orient the efficient utilisation of power towards better economic development. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper explores the equilibrium and coordination issues for an omnichannel assembly system. Four different game-theoretical model types applying four operational strategies - a total of sixteen analytical models - are developed and analyzed for both omnichannel and pure channel modes. The numerical analysis of an electronic product assembly system provides a clearer understanding of the solutions and their effects on the profits in the assembly system for different model types and operational strategies. A further sensitivity analysis with focus on an omnichannel with offline channel subsidy (OMS) creates better insights regarding how changes of key parameters affect the assembly system profits. It is found that the omnichannel mode with or without offline channel subsidy can deliver much better operational performance to the assembly system via mutual fusion effect than that of a pure online- or offline-channel mode. Furthermore, the offline channel subsidy can amplify to a very large extent the mutual fusion effect to increase the product demand dramatically and thus improving the operational performance of the assembly system in the omnichannel business scenario. The best operational strategy for the assembly system in the omnichannel business scenario is the coordination strategy with offline channel subsidy. © 2022.

Improvement of forecasting accuracy, even by a small percentage, may have a substantial impact on companies' production and financial planning, marketing strategies, inventory controls, and supply chain management. Specifically, our research goal is to forecast the sales of each product in each store in the near future.Motivated by tensor factorization methodologies for context-aware recommender systems, we propose a novel approach called the advanced temporal latent factor approach to sales forecasting, or ATLAS for short, which achieves accurate and individualized predictions for sales by building a single tensor factorization model across multiple stores and products. Our contribution is a combination of a tensor framework (to leverage information across stores and products), a new regularization function (to incorporate demand dynamics), and extrapolation of the tensor into future time periods using state-of-the-art statistical (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average models) and machine-learning (recurrent neural networks) models.

For how long should we expect this spectacularly high growth to continue? We propose a quantitative two sector model with segmented labor markets and financial frictions to evaluate the prospects for China's future growth under different policy scenarios. In our model the high growth rate observed in China since the early 1990s is fueled by the large increase in urban labor supply, because of rural–urban migration, and the emergence of private enterprises that absorb those migrant workers. Our simulations suggest that the rapid aging of its population and the decrease of rural migration should significantly decelerate urban labor force and economic growth starting around 2020. Through a counterfactual with a fixed age distribution, we find that population aging is responsible for the deceleration of economic growth between 2020 and 2040. We show that substantial relaxation of labor market segmentation and financial constraints faced by private enterprises could improve efficiency substantially and delay this process of growth deceleration by one decade. © 2022 The Author(s)","China's growth; Financial constraints; Migration; Segmented labor markets","demographic trend; economic development; economic growth; financial services; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; labor market; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126451836

This estimator minimizes the maximum bias due to outlier generating distribution deviations from a standard normal errors distribution model, and at the same time has a high normal distribution efficiency. We demonstrate the efficacy of the mOpt estimator in comparison with the non-robust least squares (LS) estimator in applications to both single factor and multifactor time series models. For the case of single factor CAPM models we compared mOpt and LS estimates for cross sections of liquid stocks from the CRSP database in each contiguous two-year interval from 1963 to 1980. The results show that absolute differences between the two estimates greater than 0.3 occur for about 18% of the stocks, and differences greater than 0.5 occur for about 7.5% of the stocks. Our application of the mOpt estimator to multifactor models focuses on fitting the Fama-French 3-factor and the Fama-French-Carhart 4-factor models to weekly stock returns for the year 2008, using both the robust t-statistics associated with the mOpt estimates and a new statistical test for differences between the mOpt and LS coefficients. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the mOpt estimator in providing better model fits than the LS estimates, which are adversely influenced by outliers. Finally, since model selection is an important aspect of time series factor model fitting, we introduce a new robust prediction errors based model selection criterion called the Robust Final Prediction Error (RFPE), which makes natural use of the mOpt regression estimator. When applied to the 4-factor model, the RFPE finds as the best subset model the one that contains the Market, SMB and MOM factors, not the three Fama-French factors Market, SMB and HML. We anticipate that RFPE will prove to be quite useful for model selection of time series factor models. © 2022, The Author(s).","Betas; Bias; Efficiency; Factor returns; Model selection; Robust regression; Time-series factor models; Variance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126231364

Developing a novel metric that operationalizes this conceptualization and counter to our expectations, we find that underexpansion has a non-negative effect on retailer profitability in the presence of moderators. Specifically, our marginal effect analysis suggests that a better corporate culture, higher selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) capital, and higher intangibility can outweigh the negative direct effect of underexpansion, leading to a positive marginal effect of underexpansion on profitability.

However, there is a lack of research providing a quantitative holistic assessment of implementing collaborative planning practices. This paper fills this knowledge gap. Using an interdependent multistep research methodology, the authors (1) analyzed a holistic literature-based list of collaborative planning risks using 46 responses from industry expert surveys; (2) calculated the criticality of these risks and compared the obtained results using Spearman rank correlation; (3) statistically analyzed the impact of these risks - based on a project-based survey that collected data from 65 different projects - using distribution fitting analysis and weighted average calculations; (4) developed a framework for predicting the cost and schedule performance impacts in relation to utilizing collaborative planning in the AEC industry; and (5) mathematically verified the research steps using an extreme condition test and sensitivity analysis, and practically validated the research output utilizing a case study example and the insights of 25 industry experts. Within the context of collaborative planning, this paper highlighted and discussed the top six risks that affect cost and schedule project performance: resistance to change, no early involvement of key project participants, lack of construction coordination, late and ineffective communication, lack of leadership, and absence of flexibility and coordination of design. Ultimately, this study provides a necessary and highly customizable metric for industry practitioners to manage their collaborative planning practices efficiently and improve their project performance. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Costs; Project management; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Surveys; Architectural construction; Architectural engineering; Collaborative planning; Cost and schedule; Cost performance; Industry experts; Lean supply; Project delivery method; Project performance; Schedule performance; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125640022

This is done by distinguishing three forms of EKA, including patent backward citations, patent collaboration and patent purchase. This research contributes to the existing EKA and open innovation literatures by studying whether EKA and internal R&D serve as substitutes or complements for firms’ innovation performance. Using a sample of 77 publicly listed firms in the electronic and information technology (EIT) industries of mainland China, with panel data collected from 2004 to 2016, this study has reached the following new findings: First, EKA both through patent backward citations and patent collaboration have significantly positive effects on firms’ innovation performance; the effect of patent purchase is not significant. Second, EKA through patent backward citations complements firms’ internal R&D, but EKA both through patent collaboration and patent purchase act as substitutes for internal R&D. Third, an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between the level of balance among the three different forms of EKA and firms’ innovation performance. Finally, contingent interaction effects exist between the level of balance among the three different forms of EKA and internal R&D on firms’ innovation performance. A complementary relationship exists with the internal R&D when firms have a high level of balance among three different forms of EKA. However, a substitution relationship exists with the internal R&D when firms have a low level of balance among the three different forms of EKA. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","External knowledge acquisition; Innovation performance; Internal R&D; Open innovation; Patent backward citations; Patent collaboration; Patent purchase","Knowledge acquisition; Patents and inventions; External knowledge; External knowledge acquisition; Firm innovation; Information technology industry; Innovation performance; Internal R&D; Open innovation; Patent backward citation; Patent collaboration; Patent purchase; Sales; data acquisition; industrial performance; industrial technology; information and communication technology; innovation; property rights; research and development; telecommunication; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125573110

A conventional approach is predict-then-optimize: first, a predictive model is built; then, this model is used to optimize decision-making. A drawback of this approach, however, is that it only incorporates costs in the second stage. Conversely, the predict-and-optimize approach proposes learning a predictive model by directly minimizing the cost of the downstream decision-making task. This is achieved by using a task-specific loss function incorporating the costs of different outcomes in the first stage, with the eventual aim of obtaining more cost-effective decisions in the second stage. This work compares both approaches in the context of cost-sensitive classification. Conceptually, we use the two-stage framework to categorize existing cost-sensitive learning methodologies by differentiating between methodologies for cost-sensitive model training and decision-making. Empirically, we compare and evaluate both approaches using different cost-sensitive training and decision-making methodologies, as well as both class-dependent and instance-dependent cost-sensitive methods. This is achieved using real-world data from a range of application areas and a combination of cost-sensitive and cost-insensitive performance measures. The key finding is that the decision-making strategy is generally found to be more effective than training with a task-specific loss or their combination. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Classification; Cost-sensitive learning; Instance-dependent costs; Supervised learning","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Forecasting; Learning systems; Conventional approach; Cost-sensitive; Cost-sensitive learning; Decisions makings; Down-stream; Empirical evaluations; Instance-dependent cost; Learning strategy; Predictive models; Specific loss function; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125470710

The extant CE literature is mainly devoted to the topic's theoretical aspects and largely neglects the linkages between theory and practice, particularly in developing countries. This paper aims to empirically investigate CE implementation and its associated drivers and barriers in the context of SPBP management in a developing country. A multiple-case design is used on a sample of five firms that engage in SPBP treatment in Vietnam. We find evidence of circular practices in SPBP management that aim at cascading use and higher value creation. We also delineate eight drivers and 14 barriers rooted in four clusters: regulatory, socio-cognitive, economic and supply chain, and technological factors. In addition to generic factors, we identify three exclusive drivers and five unique barriers specific to our cases. The findings are then interpreted through the lens of extended institutional theory to derive a holistic framework that captures the dynamic influences of various factors on CE diffusion. Our framework includes two add-ons: institutional logic and uncertainty. ‘Legitimacy-embedded efficiency’ is established as a shared logic of CE, whereby economic growth is achieved in harmony with environmental protection via the optimal use of resources. Uncertainty moderates the relative influences of legitimacy and efficiency-related factors on CE diffusion. Our practical contribution is to offer an actionable guide for key stakeholders of the SPBP supply chain, including local authorities in the transition from low-efficiency practices to novel circular ones. © 2021","Case study; Circular economy; Developing countries; Institutional theory; Seafood by-products; Supply chain management","Computer circuits; Developing countries; Efficiency; Supply chain management; Case-studies; Circular economy; Institutional theory; Product management; Seafood by-product; Seafood processing; Theoretical aspects; Theory and practice; Uncertainty; Viet Nam; Meats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125187937

Predominantly most traditional time series models are parametric in nature and they use the predicted values to generate forecast for future time steps. This leads to error accumulation in each step of the forecasting horizon which causes increasingly poorer forecast in long-term. Other than the problem of error accumulation, most parametric algorithms also require significant pre-processing, hyper-parameter tuning, training and post-processing which can often put high computational burden on the system. Therefore, this paper proposes, Model Less Time-series Forecasting (MLTF), a non-parametric approach for forecasting which does not require any pre-processing or traditional training (i.e. Backpropagation). MLTF is a non-parametric method which uses statistical representations such as trend, linearity, entropy etc. to cluster series from a pre-defined repository and the series from same cluster are tagged as similar series. The trajectory of the target series is extracted from these similar series after applying an adaptive re-sampling technique. There is minimal training involved in MLTF, therefore this framework is computationally very efficient. The model-less nature also enables it to not suffer from error accumulation in long-horizon forecast. MLTF is validated empirically with a rich set of experiments involving M1, M3 competition dataset, Electricity, Volatility and COVID-19 data (over 4500 independent uni-variate series of different frequencies i.e. Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly). The experiments demonstrate that, MLTF is significantly faster while being similar (or better) in terms of forecasting accuracy than the state-of-the-art DL methods and other non-parametric time series model. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","M competition; Model less time series framework; Non-parametric time series modeling forecasting; Similarity based time series","Errors; Forecasting; M competition; Model forecasting; Model less time series framework; Non-parametric time series modeling forecasting; Nonparametrics; Similarity based time series; Time series forecasting; Times series; Times series models; Time series",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124659118

External factors, such as the growth in online retail and changing economic conditions, have contributed to the shift in consumer needs and expectations, while many high streets have struggled to sustain the pace of the change. The sustainability of high street is influenced by a range of complex economic, environmental and social factors. As consumer needs and expectations increasingly favour social and experiential high street functions, the need to review the perception of high street success is vital. Here we identify, characterise and evaluate a set of criteria that can be used to assess the high street sustainability. By conducting the survey amongst professional experts and residents, the significance of these criteria is determined. Through the application of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS), the sustainability of several towns' high streets in England is assessed. Altogether, this study for the first time develops a sustainability assessment framework for the high street. It can be used to assist policy makers and key stakeholders in making effective decisions regarding the allocation of resources and identifying locations that require investment and development. The sustainability assessment framework for the high street can assist in achieving national and global commitments for the sustainable development. © 2022","Assessment framework; High street; Multiple criteria decision making; Sustainability; Sustainable development","decision making; multicriteria analysis; policy making; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123939921

In this work, we allow for models with many endogenous variables and make use of many instrumental variables to achieve identification. Because of the high-dimensionality in the structural equation, constructing honest confidence regions with asymptotically correct coverage is non-trivial. Our main contribution is to propose estimators and confidence regions that achieve this goal. Our approach relies on moment conditions that satisfy the usual instrument orthogonality condition but also have an additional orthogonality property with respect to specific linear combinations of the endogenous variables which are treated as nuisance parameters. We propose new pivotal procedures for estimating the high-dimensional nuisance parameters which appear in our formulation. We use a multiplier bootstrap procedure to compute critical values and establish its validity for achieving simultaneously valid confidence regions for a potentially high-dimensional set of endogenous variable coefficients. © 2021","High dimensional models; Honest confidence regions; Instrumental variables","Economics; Confidence region; High dimensionality; High-dimensional; High-dimensional models; Higher-dimensional; Honest confidence region; Instrumental variables; Linear modeling; Nuisance parameter; Structural equations; Statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122943621

Specifically, we investigate the effects of innovation differentiation and market differentiation on micro businesses' abilities to co-create value and generate positive word-of-mouth, which ultimately helps them sustain their revenues. We collect data from a sample of 196 female consumers who participated in the co-creation process used in the micro businesses to design trendy apparel. We use structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Having a strong desire for differentiation in their dresses, these consumers invest their resources and capabilities in designing their own apparel. The results show that value co-creation not only leads to consumers’ need for differentiated products (enabling the differentiation strategy), but also results in negative word-of-mouth. More particularly, value co-creation leads to differentiated offerings but consumers desirous of possessing unique products do not spread positive words about the professional designer. As a result, sustaining economic development in emerging economies dominated by micro and small businesses is still a big challenge. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Consumers' need for differentiation; Micro businesses; Value co-creation; Word-of-mouth","business; competition (economics); consumption behavior; economic development; equation; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122657270

The analysis reported in this paper exploits a unique panel dataset of poverty maps covering almost 2400 municipalities in Mexico and spanning 22 years, first, to test hypothesis that there is within-country income convergence. Second, through a decomposition of the poverty convergence elasticity, the analysis investigates whether this convergence, if it exists, has translated into poverty convergence. In a context of overall stagnant economic growth and poverty reduction since 1990, the analysis finds evidence of both income and poverty convergence among municipalities. As a cause of these, the results point to a combination of positive performance among the poorest municipalities and stagnant or deteriorating performance among more well-off municipalities. Redistributive programs such as cash transfers to poor households have played an important role in driving these results by bolstering income growth among the poorest municipalities, while also inducing progressive changes in the distribution of income. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convergence; Income inequality; Poverty convergence elasticity; Small area estimation","convergence; data set; economic growth; income distribution; panel data; poverty; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113136331

Identifying the factors affecting cancer progression, their interrelationships, and their influence on patients’ long-term survival helps make timely treatment decisions. The current study addresses this problem by proposing a Tree-Augmented Bayesian Belief Network (TAN)-based data analytics methodology comprising of four steps: data acquisition and preprocessing, variable selection via Genetic Algorithm (GA), data balancing with synthetic minority over-sampling and random under-sampling methods, and finally the development of the TAN model to determine the probabilistic inter-conditional dependency structure among breast cancer-related variables along with the posterior survival probabilities The proposed model is compared to well-known machine learning models. A what-if analysis has also been conducted to verify the associations among the variables in the TAN model. The relative importance of each variable has been investigated via sensitivity analysis. Finally, a decision support tool is developed to further explore the conditional dependency structure among the cancer-related factors. The results produced by the proposed methodology, namely the patient-specific posterior survival probabilities and the conditional relationships among the variables, can be used by healthcare professionals and physicians to improve the decision-making process in planning and managing breast cancer treatments. Our generic methodology can also accommodate other types of cancer and be applied to manage various medical procedures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Data mining; Genetic Algorithm; Machine learning; Sensitivity Analysis","Balancing; Bayesian networks; Data acquisition; Data Analytics; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diseases; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Patient treatment; Trees (mathematics); 'current; Breast Cancer; Cancer progression; Data analytics; Dependency structures; Over sampling; Probabilistic data; Random under samplings; Survival probabilities; Variables selections; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125283691

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses fixed-effects (FE) panel regression analysis, utilizing 1,614 country–year observations and 541,732 citable publications between 1996 and 2017, to explore the relationship between macroeconomic factors, research and development (R&D) expenditure and research productivity in economics and finance. Findings: The results highlight a two-way relationship between R&D expenditure and economic development and research productivity. However, research productivity has no relationship with foreign direct investment (FDI), trade and financial development. In terms of remaining macroeconomic factors, financial development, trade and FDI have insignificant associations with research productivity in both directions of causality. In line with institutional theory, the findings support the notion that economically more developed countries and countries dedicating greater R&D funds have more potential to support research activities. On the other hand, in line with knowledge spillover, the research output of nations contributes to the economic development and expansion of R&D budgets. The results are robust to alternative methodology, endogeneity concerns, additional control variables, alternative sampling and alternative research productivity proxy. Research limitations/implications: The study suggests practical implications for nations to formulate macro-policies and a better research environment for academicians and to establish links between academic research and macroeconomic factors. Originality/value: First, as there is limited research focusing on the bidirectional causality between the macroeconomic environment and academic research activity, the study adds to the understanding of the causality relationship between these two constructs. Second, it examines the bidirectional relationship between macroeconomic factors and research output at a global scale, while prior studies mostly focus on a single country, or a certain region or continent. Further, it is one of the few attempts particularly focusing on economics and finance research's bidirectional relation with the macroeconomic environment. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic development; Macroeconomic factors; Productivity; Research; Research and development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124971699

Here, we analyse 31 semi-structured interviews with climate policy government officials and consultants from 11 low-income and lower-middle income countries (LMICs) as well as the respective climate policy context, and find high average degrees of perceived discrepancies between formally adopted climate change mitigation policies and their actual implementation. Our results suggest that for our LMIC sample, both the global political process to limit climate change and domestic environmental threats have been key to drive the formal adoption of climate change mitigation policies, but have had limited effect on implementation. By contrast, momentum for implementation of climate change mitigation initiatives and projects on the ground emerges where climate policies are firmly embedded within economic and social development policies, the economy and society are comparably well-positioned to embrace the associated change, and where they have been governed by cross-ministerial institutions capable of implementing wider climate-compatible development pathways. Thus, to help translate climate policy into action, national LMIC governments and the international community need to find context-specific ways to successfully integrate climate with economic and social development policies, identify and build on feasible opportunities and competitive advantages through which the local economy can benefit from green growth, build adequate social capital, and actively create institutional spaces and processes for well-equipped and meaningful cross-ministerial co-beneift governance. The importance of unlocking co-benefits for implementing climate policies underlines both the urgency with which the international community needs to increase finance for LMICs for climate change mitigation, as well as the associated development opportunities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Climate change mitigation instruments; Climate policy; Economic and social co-benefits; Low-income countries (LICs)","Competition; Economic and social effects; Public policy; Translation (languages); Africa; Climate change mitigation; Climate change mitigation instrument; Climate policy; Cobenefits; Economic and social co-benefit; Low income countries; Low-income country; Middle-income countries; Mitigation policies; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126056410

Theoretically the link between corporate strategy, supply chain and operations for Product Deletion (PD) decisions is lacking. The purpose of this study is to develop a decision support tool that enables managers to evaluate PD decisions across business, supply chain strategies and customer considerations; rationalizing product portfolio variety while realizing long-term organizational competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to formalize PD decision-making across multiple functional strategy perspectives. Manufacturing, supply chain, finance and marketing functions are included along with incorporating multiple stakeholder voices from multiple organizational levels—including top-management team members, cross-functional managers and customers. A case study application is conducted using an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) perspective. Findings: The interrelationships between business, supply chain strategies and customer requirements are identified, along with tensions and tradeoffs using a series of “houses” or relationship matrices. The methodology provides managers with a decision support tool that can be flexible and applicable to aid sound PD decision-making incorporating multiple stakeholders. Originality/value: Product decisions at the decline stage—for example product retirement or deletion—are neglected both in research and in practice. Having a formalized systematic process can make PD outcomes more objective. The proposed QFD approach is one of the early PD decision support tools—products can be deleted for strategic, operational and customer-related reasons, and the hierarchical interrelationships among various reasons need to be carefully managed to ensure sound product portfolio rationalization. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Marketing; Product deletion; Quality function deployment (QFD); Strategic planning; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Decision support systems; Human resource management; Managers; Manufacture; Quality function deployment; Sales; Sustainable development; Corporate strategies; Decisions makings; Design/methodology/approach; Market uncertainty; Multiple stakeholders; Organisational; Product deletion; Product portfolios; Quality function deployment; Supply chain strategy; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126324573

Leveraging Japan as a least-likely crucial case, we analyze the conditions that lead legislators to take advantage of their power to summon central bankers for questioning. We find that even moderate inflation makes it more likely that legislators will summon central bankers compared to periods when the inflation rate is near zero. By contrast, deflation has either no effect or reduces the likelihood of summonses. We also find some evidence that unconventional monetary policies to combat deflation, specifically quantitative easing, are likely to invite greater legislative scrutiny.

One of the main drivers for increasing profits and market share is service quality. When consumers encounter a bad experience, or a frustration, they may be tempted to stop using the service. In collaboration with the ride-sharing platform Via, our goal is to understand the benefits of proactively compensating customers who have experienced a frustration. Motivated by historical data, we consider two types of frustrations: long waiting times and long travel times. We design and run three field experiments to investigate how different types of compensation affect the engagement of riders who experienced a frustration. We find that sending proactive compensation to frustrated riders (i) is profitable and boosts their engagement behavior, (ii) works well for long waiting times but not for long travel times, (iii) seems more effective than sending the same offer to nonfrustrated riders, and (iv) has an impact moderated by past usage frequency. We also observe that the best strategy is to send credit for future usage (as opposed to waiving the charge or sending an apologetic message).

The firm makes demand forecasts and can put a recovery effort if a disruption occurs; both are unobservable to the insurer. Accordingly, the insurer offers BI insurance to the firm while facing adverse selection and moral hazard. We first find that, because of the joint effect of limited production capacity and self-impelled recovery effort, the firm with a lower demand forecast benefits more from BI insurance than that with a higher demand forecast. Anticipating a higher premium, the low-demand firm has an incentive to pretend to have the higher demand forecast to obtain more profit. We then derive the optimal insurance contracts to deal with the information asymmetry and show how the firm’s characteristics affect the optimal contracts. Both high- and low-demand contracts are affected by the firm’s operational characteristics in the same direction, and the informational characteristics impact those contracts differently. We also analyze the case in which the firm can choose its initial capacity and find that, from the firm’s perspective, capacity and BI insurance could be either substitutes or complements.

The COVID-19 pandemic has become a new driver for the development of Internet communications between manufacturers and consumers. This article explores the relationship between the Internet traffic of companies’ websites of and their sales volumes and profitability. We apply panel data regression analysis and model of Prais–Winsten regression with panel standard error adjustment, which provides conservative and reliable estimates. In the sample of 268 observations drawn from 67 Russian firms operating in the big-ticket industries of car manufacturing and real estate development during the period of 2017-2022 characterized by a major exogenous shock, we demonstrate that internet traffic exerts a positive effect on firm sales. At the same time, this positive effect on sales is accompanied by a negative effect of internet traffic on firm profitability. The negative effect on profitability is particularly pronounced for younger firms that are likely to face severe resource constraints and can thus be said to sacrifice profitability to ensure sales. In such situation, application of cost-effective strategies may be critical for younger firms. Younger firms should pay particular attention to the contents of their websites to ensure that they provide enough adequate information that will help win the trust of new customers. © 2022, Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador.","big-ticket items; e-commerce; economic crisis; exogenous shock; firm age; Internet traffic; profitability; sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130114713

In standard quantitative macroeconomic models, expectations are unobserved variables formed endogenously via the dynamics of the model and little scrutiny is devoted to analysing the behaviour of these expectations. We show that the introduction of survey and financial market-based forecast data in the estimation of the model disciplines the expectations formation process in DSGE models. When the model-implied expectations are matched to observed expectations, the additional information of the forecasts restrains the agents’ expectations formation. We argue that the reduced volatility of the agents’ expectations dampens the model reactions to forward guidance shocks and improves the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we evaluate the case for introducing a discount factor as a reduced form proxy for a variety of microfounded approaches, proposed to mitigate the forward guidance puzzle.

To investigate the characteristics of cryptocurrencies, this study compares Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, with other major investment assets. Our analysis focuses on the efficient market hypothesis measured by the Hurst exponent, together with long-term market equilibrium measured by Shannon entropy. The findings suggest that although the Bitcoin market is less efficient than other markets, it is not significantly different from the other markets in terms of its long-term market equilibrium.

This paper develops a framework that integrates CSR in a dynamic by-production technology which captures the transformation of multiple inputs into marketed outputs, socially responsible and undesirable outputs, while accounting for adjustment costs in quasi-fixed inputs. The paper illustrates the method using a sample of European food and beverage manufacturing firms. The results of the empirical application show that there is a decline in dynamic Luenberger productivity indicators mainly due to technical inefficiency change. Hence, firms should devise strategies to enhance utilization of resources and reduce technical inefficiency. The regression of productivity change indicators on firm-specific factors showed that more indebted firms experienced a lower growth of the productivity of undesirable output, whereas more profitable firms have a lower productivity growth of variable inputs and a higher growth of the productivity of investments.

We found significant gender disparities favoring males across key indicators. Men were significantly more likely to report large decision-making input into fishing, processing, transporting, and selling fish, as well as sole ownership of important productive assets such as fishing and processing equipment, canoes, and mobile phones. Women were significantly more likely to report non-completion of any years of school and being “not at all comfortable” speaking in public on decisions affecting their fishing community, on decisions related to fishery governance, and to protest illegal/unsustainable fishing practices. Women were also significantly more likely to report that – in the past four weeks – there was no food to eat in their dwelling due to lack of resources to get food, they/another household member had gone to sleep at night hungry because there was not enough food, and they/another household member had gone a whole day and night without eating because there was not enough food. For the gender attitude questions, a sizeable proportion of both men and women disagreed that men should retain control of fishery assets, income, and decision-making. However, these opinions were not reflected in the current distribution of fishery assets, income, and decision-making autonomy. The results indicate that the WEFI is a useful quantitative instrument, as it is relatively brief while also allowing for gender-disaggregated analysis of demographic characteristics, household-level hunger, livelihoods participation, asset ownership, decision-making autonomy, and gender attitudes specific to small-scale capture fishery value chain actors.

In the context of sequential contributions, intergenerational reciprocity dynamically amplifies low past efforts by decreasing successors’ rates of contribution. Unfortunately, the behavioral literature provides few interventions to motivate intergenerational beneficence. We identify a simple intervention that motivates decision makers who receive a low endowment. In a large online experiment with 1378 subjects, we show that asking decision makers to forecast future generations’ actions considerably increases their rate of contribution (from 46% to over 60%). By shifting decision makers’ attention from the immediate past to the future, the intervention is most effective in enhancing intergenerational beneficence of subjects who did not receive a contribution from their predecessors, effectively neutralizing negative intergenerational reciprocity effects. We provide suggestive evidence that the attentional channel is the main channel at work. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Behavioral intervention; Intergenerational benevolence; Intergenerational reciprocity; Query theory; Sustainability","Earth (planet); Potable water; Behavioral interventions; Common pool resources; Decision makers; Forward looking; Intergenerational benevolence; Intergenerational reciprocity; On-line experiments; Query theory; Safe drinking water; Simple++; Decision making; climate change; common property resource; decision making; drinking water; psychology; reciprocity; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123471799

However, they are less commonly applied to the industry of logistics. This paper presents two novel LSTM networks to predict the freight loading of routing areas, and the design of a smart loading management system is introduced. While most existing works on LSTM utilize the power of its prediction very well, our study shows less accurate and instable results if only LSTM network is applied, that arise from the big variation in the dataset. Instead, two constraints are inspired in this paper. The first constraint adds a time factor node to strengthen the correlation between predicted final loading units and booked loading units as close to delivery date. And the second proposal extends to parallel training by groupwise constraint. Experiments with across 3-year records in a national wide home furnishing retail company show that constraint LSTM networks significantly improve both the accuracy and stability of the prediction. Besides, the design of a smart loading management system will be shown, in which LSTM model plays the core rule to predict loading capacity, meanwhile the rule-based system triggers different events based on loading prediction and truck size. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Logistics prediction; LSTM","Loading; Long short-term memory; Case-studies; Deep learning; Home furnishing; Learning models; Loading units; Logistic prediction; Management systems; Memory network; State of the art; Time series forecasting; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119516550

We follow a socio-cognitive perspective by suggesting that awards of restricted stock are viewed as potential gains or potential losses depending on each CEO's dominant regulatory focus. Regulatory focus, therefore, helps determine how a CEO responds to restricted stock awards. We also propose that the moderating effect of regulatory focus strengthens as firm complexity increases and as CEO tenure lengthens, because complexity and tenure both increase CEOs' reliance on heuristic information processing. Specifically, complexity restricts a CEO's cognitive capacity for thoughtful deliberation during decision making, and tenure affects a CEO's motivation to search for and process information thoroughly.

These including extracting ‘features’ of temporal patterns (e.g. maxima, time of maxima) which have utility in understanding the network properties of each connection and summarising whole-network properties as a continuous function of time which allows estimation of network properties at any time without temporal aggregation of non-simultaneous measurements. Results for temporal pattern features in the response variable were captured with reasonable accuracy. Variation in the temporal pattern features for the exposure variable was underestimated by the models. The models showed some lack of precision. Both model summaries provided clear ‘real-world’ interpretations and could be applied to data from a range of spatio-temporal network structures (e.g. rivers, social networks). These models should be tested more extensively in a range of scenarios, with potential improvements such as random effects in the exposure variable dimension. © 2021, The Author(s).","Hierarchical modelling; Multilevel modelling; Networks; Spatio-temporal data","accuracy assessment; computer simulation; estimation method; GIS; hierarchical system; model test; numerical model; precision; railway transport; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation system; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111676210

This study builds on the literature regarding employer branding and talent acquisition by examining the effect sales program sponsorship has on students. Grounded in organizational reputation theories, brand equity, and the literature on corporate sponsorship, it is proposed that sponsoring a sales program leads to positive student–firm related perceptions. Additionally, it is predicted that classroom engagement in the form of coteaching enhances these positive effects. Two natural field experiments, one involving two semesters of professional sales students (n = 90), the other involving four semesters of professional sales students (n = 174), are conducted to test the conceptual model. Results confirm the study’s predictions that sponsoring firms are perceived more favorably by students, and classroom engagement enhances these positive perceptions. Finally, results suggest that firms with lower initial familiarity among students have the most to gain in terms of enhancing student perceptions through coteaching. © The Author(s) 2021.","employer branding; recruiting practices; sales; sales education; sponsorship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109367371

In two preregistered studies, one field experiment, and an analysis of secondary data, we show that giving gifts has a dark side, as it can negatively affect subsequent interpersonal behavior between givers and receivers. In Study 1, we found that giving a gift to one's romantic partner changes givers' interpretation of which behaviors constitute infidelity. Specifically, we found that givers (vs. nongivers) classified their questionable behaviors (e.g., sending a flirtatious text to someone other than their partner) less as a form of cheating on their partner. In Study 2, we examined how politely participants behave when delivering bad news to a friend. We found that givers (vs. nongivers) wrote significantly less polite messages to their friend. In Study 3, we tested real gifts that people give to friends and found givers (vs. nongivers) subsequently made more selfish decisions at their friends' expense. In all, our research refines the oft-cited axiomatic assumption that gift giving strengthens relationships and illuminates the potential for future research to examine how decision making can alter interpersonal, romantic relationships. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","field study; gift giving; licensing; romantic relationships","adult; article; decision making; female; field experiment; field study; friend; gift giving; human; human experiment; licensing; male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105811523

Yet, despite attempts to mandate menu labeling and the studies examining consumer's perception of menu nutritional information and how this perception impacts dining behavior and intention to consume, concerns for obesity and malnutrition continue to be at the forefront of public health discussions. This study attempts to comprehend consumers' nutritional goals, intention and food choice behavior, thereby suggesting how to leverage this information for change. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data and a proposed and validated theoretical model, the study identified the different aspects of consumer's food choice by analyzing the relationship of consumer's perceived importance toward nutrition information, food choice and healthy daily behavior, and intention to improve health. Findings: Consumers who perceive higher importance of nutrition information are more likely to choose healthy food when dining out and have stronger health improvement intention. The results also suggested healthy food choice and healthy daily behavior positively influenced health improvement intention. Originality/value: Despite the previous studies on menu labeling and the numerous policy mandates, there is still concern about the food choice behavior of consumers while eating out. No serious effort exists to regulate food service providers similar to the regulation of other consumer products, whereby consumers are generally protected from harm. This study suggests through education, promotional marketing and industry partnerships, motivating and leveraging consumers' desire for healthy food choices could move food service providers and policy makers to change what information is provided. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dining out; Nutrition labeling; ood choice behavior","article; catering service; consumer; decision making; eating; education; human; human experiment; marketing; menu labeling; South Korea; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116120568

They often face customers in transit (i.e. transient delivery) and with minimal information of their preferences (i.e. high uncertainty). This study investigates how such shops create service experience to customers by focusing on three constructs, namely, customer orientation, management commitment to service quality and quality of leader-member exchange in service systems with the uncertain and transient nature. Building on a systems approach of service experience design, the authors examine all possible effects (main effects and two-way and three-way interaction effects) on customer experience. Specifically, to frame the two-way and the three-way interaction effects, the authors adopt the contingency and configuration approaches, respectively. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a multiple respondent approach involving managers, employees and customers to collect data from 225 service shops in Hong Kong. Hierarchically moderated regression analysis is employed to analyze the collected data. Findings: Contrary to our initial conceptualization, most of the direct effects and two-way interaction effects among the three constructs are insignificant. The authors do, however, uncover a significant effect of the three-way interaction term. The authors analyze the results from the configuration perspective. Originality/value: The finding suggests that the configuration approach is necessary to determine the configuration concerning how design elements align with one another to generate an integrative effect on customer experience. The authors conclude that for high-contact services of the transient and high-uncertainty type, all three constructs must operate simultaneously to evoke favorable customer experience. Customer experience is holistically developed in a service system with high-uncertainty and transient nature, requiring simultaneous alignment across a range of design choices among those involved in service delivery (manager, employee and customer). © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer orientation; Customer satisfaction; Leader-member exchange; Quality commitment","Human resource management; Managers; Regression analysis; Sales; Contact-services; Customer experience; Customer orientation; Customers' satisfaction; Interaction effect; Leader-member exchanges; Quality commitment; Service experience; Three-way interactions; Uncertainty; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125065661

The unique cultural context of this state is used to challenge Hakim’s preference theory; specifically, that the individual agency of work-oriented women is stronger than structural constraints, including culture. This study joins others that have questioned the preference theory’s applicability in certain cultural contexts. Design/methodology/approach: A simple approach using difference-of-means t-tests shows that female respondents in 2016 are more like their male contemporaries than they are to their sister administrators 30 years prior. T-tests are also used to compare male respondents in 1986 and 2016. Findings: Women in upper management in 2016 are more likely to be married and have preschool-aged children at home than they were in 1986. These results suggest that women are succeeding at the highest levels in state government administration and also adhering to strong cultural norms. Women’s views on labor market policies changed over time, as well. While women in 2016 are found to resemble their male counterparts in 2016 more than they resemble female respondents in 1986, variations in men’s responses in 1986 and 2016 are statistically no different from zero.

The results indicate that city government policies, economic power, the influence of megacities, and the geographical region of the cities have significant effects on industrial pollution, in particular, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission reduction and dust reduction. After taking account of the interaction effect of city government policies and the other three factors, it was found that economic power is the only factor to have a significant interaction with city government policies on industrial pollution reduction. The ARDL test found long-term causality among industrial pollution reduction, fixed assets investment, and GDP per-capita in city, urban agglomeration, and regional levels.

This is in contrast to existing studies of racial bias on digital platforms that focus on peer-to-peer marketplaces (e.g., eBay), in which both the perpetrators and the victims are individuals acting independently and on their own behalf. In particular, we present the first evidence of B2C bias in corporate social media customer service, a practice that has grown in popularity recently. Unlike traditional call centers, agents providing customer service on social media respond, on average, to fewer than half of the complaints they receive as per our analysis. We investigate the effect of a complaining customer’s racial identity, as revealed by the social media profile picture, on the chance of receiving a response. By analyzing more than 57,000 social media customer complaints to major U.S. airlines and leveraging a variety of analytics techniques, including text mining and facial recognition, we present quantitative evidence that African American customers are less likely to receive a response when they complain than otherwise similar White customers. Furthermore, our deep learning–based falsification test shows that the bias is absent without the visual cue that reveals racial identity. This study offers a practical yet powerful recommendation for companies: conceal all customer profile pictures from their employees while delivering social media customer service. © 2021 INFORMS","customer service; deep learning; racial bias; social media","Character recognition; Deep learning; Face recognition; Sales; Social networking (online); Business to customers; Call centers; Corporates; Customer-service; Deep learning; Digital platforms; Large-scales; Peer to peer; Racial bias; Social media; Personnel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134681799

Combining signaling theory and technology frames, we examine if, how, and to what extent IT investments over time shape three facets of reputation: generalized favorability, being known, and being known for something. In accessing healthcare services, most patients are unable to assess a hospital’s quality of care directly. Faced with such information asymmetries, patients tend to consider a hospital’s reputation in the media when making care decisions. Indeed, journalists are well positioned to detect even the weaker quality signals—among which are state-of-the-art IT—that a hospital emits. As information intermediaries, journalists aggregate and interpret IT-related signals against the backdrop of their technology frames, which reflect their expectations of how a modern hospital IT should look. Perceived congruence between their IT-related expectations and observations on the ground is likely to translate into less critical writing about a hospital. We test our theorizing based on a comprehensive panel data set of 152 English hospital organizations spanning five consecutive years of IT investments and subsequent changes in media reputation as reflected in 175,973 articles in English newspapers. We find that investments in IT staff increase the “being known” facet of reputation as evidenced in the volume of media coverage. Investments in IT equipment, in contrast, positively affect a hospital’s general favorability as mirrored in the tenor of its media coverage. Our econometric analysis as well as our complementary content analysis of newspaper articles and follow up interviews with journalists allow us to attribute this effect primarily to more visible IT equipment investments that prompt journalists to write less negatively about a hospital. These findings suggest that investments in IT equipment can buffer hospitals from negative press, thereby helping them to gain and maintain a strong reputation in the media. © 2022 INFORMS","healthcare; hospital; information technology; IT investment; IT value; media; reputation; signaling; technology frames","Contrast media; Health care; Investments; Newsprint; Statistical tests; Healthcare; Information technology equipments; Information technology investments; Information technology value; Media coverage; Medium; Reputation; Signaling; Signaling theory; Technology frame; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134643127

JANOS allows for specifying a prescriptive model using standard optimization modeling elements such as constraints and variables. The key novelty lies in providing modeling constructs that enable the specification of commonly used predictive models within an optimization model, have the features of the predictivemodel as variables in the optimizationmodel, and incorporate the output of the predictive models as part of the objective. The framework considers two sets of decision variables: regular and predicted. The relationship between the regular and the predicted variables is specified by the user as pretrained predictive models. JANOS currently supports linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network with rectified linear activation functions.

Notably, for online retailers that do not operate offline stores, their target customers are more sensitive to the quality of logistic services, such as delivery speed and reliability. This paper is motivated by a leading online retailer for cosmetic products on Taobao.comthat aimed to improve its logistics efficiency by redesigning its centralized distribution network into a multilevel one. The multilevel distribution network consists of a layer of primary facilities to hold stocks from suppliers and transshipment and a layer of secondary facilities to provide last-mile delivery. There are two major challenges of designing such a facility network. First, online customers can respond significantly to the change of logistics efficiency with the redesigned network, thereby rendering the network optimized under the original demand distribution suboptimal. Second, because online retailers have relatively small sales volumes and are very flexible in choosing facility locations, the facility candidate set can be large, causing the facility location optimization challenging to solve. To this end, we propose an iterative prediction-and-optimization strategy for distribution network design. Specifically, we first develop an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict customer demands, factoring in the logistic service quality given the network and the city-level purchasing power based on demographic statistics. Then, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to choose facility locations with minimum transportation, facility setup, and package processing costs. We further develop an efficient two-stage heuristic for computing high-quality solutions to the MILP model, featuring an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm and an expectation and maximization algorithm. Subsequently, the ANN demand predictor and two-stage heuristic are integrated for iterative network design. Finally, using a real-world data set, we validate the demand prediction accuracy and demonstrate the mutual interdependence between the demand and network design. Summary of Contribution: We propose an iterative prediction-and-optimization algorithm for multilevel distribution network design for e-logistics and evaluate its operational value for online retailers. We address the issue of the interplay between distribution network design and the demand distribution using an iterative framework. Further, combining the idea in operational research and data mining, our paper provides an end-to-end solution that can provide accurate predictions of online sales distribution, subsequently solving large-scale optimization problems for distribution network design problems.

The follower must solve an optimization problem that has been previously perturbed by means of a series of attacking actions led by the attacker. These attacking actions aim at augmenting the cost of the decision variables of the follower's optimization problem. The objective, from the attacker's viewpoint, is that of choosing an attacking strategy that reduces as much as possible the quality of the optimal solution attainable by the follower. The progressive approximationmechanismconsists of the iterative solution of an interdiction probleminwhich the attacker actions are restricted to a subset of thewhole solution space and a pricing subprobleminvokedwith the objective of proving the optimality of the attacking strategy. This scheme is especially useful when the optimal solutions to the follower's subproblem intersect with the decision space of the attacker only in a small number of decision variables. In such cases, the progressive approximation method can solve interdiction games otherwise intractable for classicalmethods.We illustrate the efficiency of our approach on the shortest path, 0-1 knapsack and facility location interdiction games. Summary of Contribution: In this article, we present a progressive approximation algorithm for the exact solution of several classes of interdiction games in which two noncooperative players (namely an attacker and a follower) interact sequentially. We exploit the discrete nature of this interdiction game to design an effective algorithmic framework that improves the performance of general-purpose solvers. Our algorithm combines elements from mathematical programming and computer science, including a metaheuristic algorithm, a binary search procedure, a cutting-planes algorithm, and supervalid inequalities. Although we illustrate our results on three specific problems (shortest path, 0-1 knapsack, and facility location), our algorithmic framework can be extended to a broader class of interdiction problems. © 2021 INFORMS.","bilevel optimization; integer programming; Interdiction; Stackelberg games","Approximation algorithms; Computer programming; Costs; Decision making; Graph theory; Iterative methods; Optimal systems; Attacking strategy; Bi-level optimization; Decision variables; Exact solution; Integer Program- ming; Interdiction; Optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Short-path; Stackelberg Games; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134468191

The SAHLP-h is a generalization of the classical single allocation hub location problem (SAHLP), in which the hub-hub connection costs are piecewise linear functions of the amounts of flow. We model the problem as an integer nonlinear program, which we then reformulate as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and as a mixed integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP). We exploit the special structures of these models to develop Benders-type decomposition methods with integer subproblems. We use an integer L-shaped decomposition to solve the MILP formulation. For the MIQCP, we dualize a set of complicating constraints to generate a Lagrangian function, which offers us a subproblem decomposition and a tight lower bound. We develop linear dual functions to underestimate the integer subproblem, which helps us obtain optimality cuts with a convergence guarantee by solving a linear program. Moreover, we develop a specialized polynomial-time algorithm to generate enhanced cuts. To evaluate the efficiency of our models and solution approaches, we perform extensive computational experiments on both uncapacitated and capacitated SAHLP-h instances derived from the classical Australian Post data set. The results confirm the efficacy of our solution methods in solving large-scale instances. © 2021 INFORMS","Benders decomposition; economies of scale; hub location; Lagrangian relaxation; quadratic program; single allocation","Economics; Lagrange multipliers; Location; Piecewise linear techniques; Polynomial approximation; Quadratic programming; Benders' decompositions; Economy of scale; Generalisation; Hub location; Hub location problems; Lagrangian relaxations; Mixed integer quadratically constrained programs; Quadratic programs; Single allocation; Sub-problems; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133969810

However, its use for optimal dynamic pricing or advertising is relatively limited because the Generalized Bass Model (GBM), which extends the BM to handle marketing variables, uses only percentage changes in marketing variables, rather than their actual values. This restricts the GBM’s prescriptive use, for example, to derive the optimal price path for a new product, conditional on an assumed launch price, but not the launch price itself. In this paper, we employ a utility-based extension of the BM, which can yield normative prescriptions regarding both the introductory price and the price path after launch, for the new product. We offer two versions of this utility-based diffusion model, namely, the Bass-Gumbel Diffusion Model (BGDM) and the Bass-Logit Diffusion Model (BLDM), the latter of which has been previously used. We show that both the BGDM and BLDM handily outperform the GBM in forecasting new product sales using empirical data from four product categories. We discuss how to estimate the BGDM and BLDM in the absence of past sales data. We compare the optimal pricing policy of the BLDM with the GBM and derive optimal pricing policies that are implied by the BLDM under various ranges of model parameters. We illustrate a dynamic pricing approach that allows managers to derive optimal marketing policies in a computationally convenient manner and extend this approach to a competitive, multiproduct case.

However, regulators sometimes approve drugs using a surrogate outcome—an intermediate indicator that is faster or easier to measure than the true outcome of interest—for example, progression-free survival—as the primary endpoint when there is demonstrable medical need. Although using a surrogate outcome (instead of the true outcome) as the primary endpoint can substantially speed up clinical trials and lower costs, it can also result in poor drug-approval decisions because the surrogate is not a perfect predictor of the true outcome. In this paper, we propose combining data from both surrogate and true outcomes to improve decision making within a late-phase clinical trial. In contrast to broadly used clinical trial designs that rely on a single primary endpoint, we propose a Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design that simultaneously leverages both observed outcomes to inform trial decisions. We perform comparative statics on the relative benefit of our approach, illustrating the types of diseases and surrogates for which our proposed design is particularly advantageous. Finally, we illustrate our proposed design on metastatic breast cancer. We use a large-scale clinical trial database to construct a Bayesian prior and simulate our design on a subset of clinical trials. We estimate that our design would yield a 16% decrease in trial costs relative to existing clinical trial designs, while maintaining the same Type I/II error rates.

We design online learning algorithms for product ranking that maximize the number of customers who engage with the site. Customers’ product preferences and attention spans are correlated and unknown to the retailer; furthermore, the retailer cannot exploit similarities across products, owing to the fact that the products are not necessarily characterized by a set of attributes. We develop a class of online learning-then-earning algorithms that prescribe a ranking to offer each customer, learning from preceding customers’ clickstream data to offer better rankings to subsequent customers. Our algorithms balance product popularity with diversity, the notion of appealing to a large variety of heterogeneous customers. We prove that our learning algorithms converge to a ranking that matches the best-known approximation factors for the offline, complete information setting. Finally, we partner with Wayfair — a multibillion-dollar home goods online retailer — to estimate the impact of our algorithms in practice via simulations using actual clickstream data, and we find that our algorithms yield a significant increase (5–30%) in the number of customers that engage with the site.

In a field study, a possible channel of disease transmission between consecutive guests in hotel rooms is revealed. In order to prevent the transmission, an innovative assembly-line housekeeping method is developed. Academic/practical relevance: The transmission of infectious diseases during hotel stays (e.g., by touching unclean towels or bed linens) has been reported globally. Under the current COVID-19 pandemic, having contact with saliva or mucus left by an infected person could cause infection. The standard housekeeping process used by the majority of hotels leaves a channel for new towels and bed linens in refreshed rooms to be contaminated by bacteria or viruses from used towels and bed linens. Eliminating the contamination channel and preventing disease transmission are crucial for protecting the health and safety of hotel guests, especially under a disease outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: The research was conducted during a field study at a hotel. To design the assembly-line process, the service time distribution of each housekeeping operational step is characterized using data collected from the practice at hundreds of hotel rooms. An optimization model is proposed to optimize the operation. Through a pilot test, the performance of the assembly-line and the traditional housekeeping methods is compared. Results: The pilot test results show that the assembly-line housekeeping method has the potential to improve not only hygienic standards but also, labor efficiency and service quality (error rate). Managerial implications: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic draws tremendous public attention on disease transmission and public hygiene. The principle of the assembly-line method (i.e., eliminating contamination channels through teamwork operational design) can be applied to not only hotel housekeeping practices but also, many other service settings. It leads to hygienic, efficient, and reliable operations, at no additional cost. © 2021 INFORMS","assembly line; hotel hygiene; housekeeping operation; labor efficiency","Assembly; Assembly machines; Efficiency; Transmissions; Viruses; 'current; Assembly line; Bed linen; Disease transmission; Divide-and-conquer; Field studies; Hotel hygiene; Housekeeping operation; Labor efficiency; Pilot tests; Hotels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132235128

A key driver of overstenting is physician subjectivity in eyeballing a coronary angiogram. Advanced tests such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) provide more precise and objective measures of PCI appropriateness, yet the decision to perform these tests is endogenous and not immune to clinical ambiguity associated with eyeballing. Additionally, conflicts of interest, arising from revenue-generating incentives, play a role in overstenting. Academic/practical relevance: Conventional wisdom suggests more precise diagnostic testing will help reduce overtreatment. However, the literature rarely recognizes that the testing decision is itself endogenous. Our research highlights the role of endogeneity surrounding interventional cardiology decision making. Methodology: This study uses stochastic modeling and simulation. Results: Under a low conflict-of-interest level, the physician performs the advanced test for intermediate lesions. Under a high conflict-of-interest level, however, the physician would perform the advanced test only for high-grade lesions, because of a financial disincentive: Performing the advanced test may lower PCI revenue if the test results argue against the procedure. Surprisingly, despite this disincentive, a more revenue-driven physician can be more inclined to perform the advanced test. Managerial implications: Our model leads to implications for various efforts aimed at tackling overstenting: (1) Attention should be paid not only to the sheer quantity of FFR procedures but to which patients receive FFR procedures; (2) reducing the risk of the advanced test has a behavior-inducing effect, yet a modest risk reduction may lower patient welfare; and (3) offering a bonus to the physician for performing FFR procedures equal to a third of its reimbursement rate will cause only a 5% increase in average physician payment while inducing a 26% decline in overstenting. In addition, we show implementing a bundled payment scheme may discourage the use of FFR procedures and lead to more salient overstenting. © 2021 INFORMS","clinical ambiguity; conflicts of interest; fractional flow reserve (FFR); health policy; healthcare operations management; interventional cardiology decision making; percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)","Cardiology; Diagnosis; Patient treatment; Stochastic systems; Testing; Clinical ambiguity; Conflicts of interest; Decisions makings; Fractional flow reserve; Fractional flow reserves; Health policy; Healthcare operations managements; Interventional cardiology; Interventional cardiology decision making; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132220955

Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, WA  98195, United States","Problem definition: We study a two-stage supply chain, where the supplier procures a key component to manufacture a product and the buyer orders from the supplier to meet a price-sensitive demand. As the input price is volatile, the two parties enter into either a standard contract, where the buyer orders just before the supplier starts production, or a time-flexible contract, where the buyer can lock a wholesale price in advance. Moreover, we consider three selling-price schemes: Market Driven, Cost Plus, and Profit Max. Academic/ practical relevance: This problem is motivated by real practices in the cloud industry. Our model and optimization approach can address similar problems in other industries as well. Methodology: We assume that the input price follows a geometric Brownian motion. To determine the optimal ordering time, we propose an optimization approach that is different from the classic approach by Dixit et al. (1994) and Li and Kouvelis (1999). Our approach leads to deeper analytical results and more transparent ordering policy. Through a numerical experimentation, we compare profitability of different parties under different contracts, pricing schemes, and market conditions. Results: The buyer’s ordering policy is determined by a threshold policy based on the current time and input price; the optimal threshold depends on not only the drift and volatility of the input price but also, their relative magnitude. The supplier’s optimal procurement time should be determined by analyzing a trade-off between the holding cost of storing the components and the future input-price movement. Managerial implications: Under the Profit-Max and the Cost-Plus pricing schemes, the time-flexible contract is a Pareto improvement compared with the standard contract, whereas under the Market-Driven pricing scheme, the supplier may be better off under the standard contract. Moreover, although the most favorable scenario for the buyer is under the Profit-Max pricing scheme, the most favorable scenario for the supplier oftentimes is under the Cost-Plus pricing scheme. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights into impacts of various characteristics of the component market, such as the trend and volatility of the input price, on the expected profit of the supply chain and its split between the two parties. © 2021 INFORMS","cloud-computing industry; input-price uncertainty; pricing schemes; procurement contracts","Brownian movement; Costs; Economic and social effects; Locks (fasteners); Sales; Supply chains; Cloud-computing; Cloud-computing industry; Computing industry; Flexible contracts; Input-price uncertainty; Market driven; Optimization approach; Price uncertainty; Pricing scheme; Procurement contracts; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132211919

Academic/Practical Relevance: Sports teams face challenges in maintaining or increasing ticket sales levels. With the growth of analytics, they aim to implement data-driven pricing techniques to improve gate revenues; however, they do not have state-of-the-art demand estimation and price optimization tools that take into account the range of valuations across different seat sections and opponent match-ups. Methodology: Partnering with a college football team, we develop a data-driven pricing tool which (1) segments customers in two sales channels, using transaction-level data and anonymous customer profiles; (2) explores the decision-making process of different customers within these segments using the Multinomial Logit and Mixed Multinomial Logit frameworks; and (3) computes optimal or near-optimal prices subject to some business constraints enforced by the team management. In addition, our method takes the sequential arrivals of customers and the capacity constraints of seat categories into account. Results: Our estimation results show that customers differ significantly in their sensitivities to price and distance to the field within each segment, in addition to the differences across segments. We also observe that customers become less likely to choose a seat category as its remaining inventory falls below a certain point. Managerial Implications: By analyzing different policies, we show that price optimization could increase revenue by as much as 7.6%. In addition, better categorization of games and further refinement of seat category differentiation and related pricing may help further boost this figure up to 11.9%. © 2021 INFORMS","analytics; college football; discrete choice models; events/sports tickets; pricing","Costs; Decision making; Economics; Human resource management; Sales; Analytic; College football; Data driven; Discrete choice models; Event/sport ticket; Multinomial Logit; Price optimisation; Problem definition; Sales channels; State of the art; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132211215

Using a nationwide U.S. database of medical and pharmaceutical claims, we investigate the care delivery process at the most common entry point to opioid use: the primary care setting. For patients who return to primary care for a follow-up appointment within 30 days of opioid initiation, we ask who should revisit and potentially revise the opioid-based treatment plan: the initial prescriber (provider concordance) or an alternate clinician (provider discordance)? First, using a fully controlled logistic model, we find that provider discordance reduces the likelihood of long-term opioid use 12 months after opioid initiation by 31% (95% Confidence Interval: [18%, 43%]). Both the instrumental variable analysis technique and propensity-score matching (utilizing the minimum-bias estimator approach) account for omitted variable bias and indicate that this is a conservative estimate of the true causal effect. Second, looking at patient activities immediately after the follow-up appointment, we find that this long-term reduction is at least partially explained by an immediate reduction in opioids prescribed after the follow-up appointment. Third, the data suggest that the benefit associated with provider discordance remains significant regardless of whether the patient’s initial prescriber was their regular primary care provider or another clinician. Overall, our analysis indicates that systematic, operational changes in the early stages of managing new opioid patients may offer a promising, and hitherto overlooked, opportunity to curb the opioid epidemic.

To develop a credibility DEA model, a credibility counterpart constraint is suggested for each constraint of DEA model. Then, the weights generated by the credibility DEA (CDEA) model are considered as ideal solution in a multi-objective DEA model. To solve the multi-objective DEA model, a goal programming model is proposed. The goal programming model minimized deviations from the ideal solutions and found the common weights of inputs and outputs. Using the common weights generated by goal programming model, the final efficiency scores for decision making are calculated. The usefulness and applicability of the proposed approach have been shown using a data set in the airline industry. © Authors 2022","Airline; Common weight; Credibility theory; DEA; Efficiency","Air transportation; Data envelopment analysis; Decision theory; Efficiency; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Common weights; Credibility theory; Data envelopment analysis models; Decision making unit; Decisions makings; Goal programming model; Ideal solutions; Input and outputs; Multi objective; Performance; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128818955

Specifically, this procedure yields a more robust specification when linearity assumptions break down, when in the presence of structural breaks, or when the data generating process is heterogeneous across the cross-section units.

Amidst concerns that past economic shocks have left permanent scars on long-term growth, known as hysteresis, we find no robust evidence of a long-run causal effect between pandemic-induced uncertainty and most of key aggregate economic variables.

The decision maker’s objective is to select a general pricing policy with maximum worst-case ratio of revenue compared with an oracle with knowledge of the value distribution, when the latter is only known to belong to some general nonparametric class. We study achievable performance for two central classes: regular and monotone hazard rate (mhr) distributions. We develop a novel unified general approach to quantify the performance of mechanisms. The approach allows us to characterize optimal performance for the fundamental case of a single sample through lower and upper bounds on the maximin ratio, with corresponding near-optimal mechanisms and near-worst-case distributions. Furthermore, by extending this class of mechanisms to the cases in which more samples are available, we leverage our general approach to analyze a novel family of policies leading to new results on achievable performance as the number of samples increases. At a higher level, this work also uncovers insights on the value of samples for pricing purposes. For example, against mhr distributions, a single sample guarantees 64% of the performance an oracle with full knowledge of the distribution would achieve, two samples suffice to ensure 71%, and 10 samples guarantee 80% of such performance. © 2022 INFORMS","approximation ratio; data-driven decision making; market research; monotone hazard rate distributions; pricing; regular distributions; robust pricing; value of data","Decision making; Hazards; Knowledge management; Market Research; Approximation ratios; Data driven decision; Data-driven decision making; Decisions makings; Hazard rates; Market researches; Monotone hazard rate distribution; Rate distributions; Regular distribution; Robust pricing; Value of data; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128401319

Often, firms lack important information about a new product, such as its potential market size and the speed of its adoption by consumers. One of the most popular frameworks that has been used for modeling new product adoption is the Bass model. Although the Bass model and its many variants are used to study dynamic pricing of new products, the vast majority of these models require a priori knowledge of parameters that can only be estimated from historical data or guessed using institutional knowledge. In this paper, we study the interplay between pricing and learning for a monopolist whose objective is to maximize the expected revenue of a new product over a finite selling horizon. We extend the generalized Bass model to a stochastic setting by modeling adoption through a continuous-time Markov chain with which the adoption rate depends on the selling price and on the number of past sales. We study a pricing problem in which the parameters of this demand model are unknown, but the seller can utilize real-time demand data for learning the parameters. We propose two simple and computationally tractable pricing policies with O(ln m) regret, where m is the market size. © 2022 INFORMS","Bass model; data-driven pricing; demand learning","Commerce; Continuous time systems; Learning systems; Markov processes; Sales; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bass model; Data driven; Data-driven pricing; Demand learning; Dynamic pricing; Historical data; Market sizes; Potential markets; Priori knowledge; Product adoption; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128361572

This study aims to explore the impact of tourism along with some other regressors, namely labor force, official development assistance, local investment, and inflation rate on the economic growth rate of the developing country of Pakistan. Material and Methods. We used annual time series data over the period from 1980 to 2018 for empirical analysis. Based on the order of integration of data, we employed an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. Results. Empirical results vindicated a positive relationship between tourism and growth. The official development assistance and inflation rate have shown significantly negative impacts on the economic growth of Pakistan, whereas domestic investment has shown an insignificantly positive impact on the economic growth. Conclusions. The empirical findings exhibit that tourism plays a key role in the process of economic growth and development of Pakistan. The study recommends that the management authorities should implement appropriate policies to attract more tourists to improve economic growth of Pakistan. Furthermore, sincere efforts are required to ensure macroeconomic stability through controlling inflation, avoiding reception of foreign aid, and encouraging global investment. © 2022 Muhammad Azam et al.","economic growth; Pakistan; time series data; tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127552659

Recent analysis of data from the UK's long-term National Bat Monitoring Programme (NBMP) suggests stable or increasing population trends for many bat species, and these statistics help inform progress towards national biodiversity targets. However, although based on robust citizen science survey designs, it is unknown how sensitive these trends are to spatial and environmental biases. Here we use Bayesian hierarchical modelling with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), to examine the impact of these types of biases on the population trends using relative occupancy of four species monitored by the NBMP Field Survey in Great Britain (GB): Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus. Where possible, we also disaggregated trends to national levels using the best model per species to determine if national differences in trends remain once sampling biases are accounted for. Although we found evidence of spatial clustering in the NBMP Field Survey locations, the previously reported GB-wide population trends are broadly robust to spatial autocorrelation. In most species, accounting for spatial autocorrelation and species-environment relationships improved model fit. The nationally disaggregated models highlighted that GB-wide trends mask differences between England and Scotland, consistent with previous analysis of these data, as well as illustrating large gaps in survey effort, especially in Wales.

Therefore, ensuring trends are robust to sampling biases present in citizen science datasets is critical to effective monitoring of progress towards biodiversity targets, managing populations sustainably, and ultimately a reversal of global declines. © 2022","Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Biodiversity indicators; Chiroptera; Community science; INLA; Passive acoustic monitoring; Sampling biases","Autocorrelation; Population statistics; Surveys; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Biodiversity indicators; Chiropterum; Citizen science; Community science; Integrated nested laplace approximation; Laplace's approximation; Passive acoustic monitoring; Sampling bias; Spatial autocorrelations; Biodiversity; bat; biodiversity; environment; sampling bias",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125489082

It typically overwhelms the capacity of official first responders from the local emergency response system. With the advancement of GPS technology to map real-time positions, registered volunteers in the community could be a valuable addition to complement the official resources. In this paper, we propose an optimization model to aid in the initial dispatch of official responders and registered volunteers. We discuss how this model can be integrated with the existing registered volunteer management tools (e.g., databases and smart phone applications) to generate an upgraded emergency responder dispatching workflow for field practices. We model uncertainty in model parameters through different scenarios. Our objective is to maximize both the expected number of served victims across all scenarios and the minimum (worst-case) percentage of served victims among all scenarios. Based on a hypothetical case study of a mass-casualty incident in New York City, we illustrate how our model could increase emergency response outcomes by leveraging currently unutilized registered volunteers as emergency response resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Catastrophic mass-casualty incidents; Initial dispatching; Official responders; Registered volunteers","database; GPS; local participation; logistics; mobile phone; numerical model; optimization; real time; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125387684

We analyzed 10 Latinx testimonios (culturally situated narratives) wherein they voice their experiences as first-generation students in US graduate programs. Testimonialistas expressed how they navigate the complexities of being first-generation students and described how they persist and enact social justice. Situating the case: TPC programs may examine the relationship between social injustices and student retention and recruitment efforts, yet there is a dearth of literature regarding specific obstacles that Latinx students face. We examined how they build success through coalitional action and culturally informed tactical decision-making. Methods: We recruited participants who self-identified as first-generation Latinx students in TPC and other graduate programs. We conducted and recorded semistructured interview sessions based in testimonio and intersectional feminist methodologies. We used qualitative data coding and MAXQDA coding software to assemble and map social justice themes at work across the testimonios. Results: Analysis suggests that first-generation Latinx graduate students draw on complex informal and formal networks to aid their success, desire more effective culturally responsive mentorship, and develop tactical decision-making skills to circumvent oppressive behaviors. Conclusions: We suggest that directors, mentors, administrators, faculty, and Latinx students begin with a social justice framework to better listen to, understand, and address first-generation Latinx college experiences and build cohort-based support mechanisms into programmatic objectives and professional development sessions. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","First-generation Latinx students; Social justice; Testimonio","Decision making; Cultural difference; First-generation latinx student; Global communication; Graduate programme; Graduate students; Mentoring; Professional communication; Social justice; Technical communications; Testimonio; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124734879

Much research has focused on why, how, or what social content is popular, trending and “hype”. One central challenge is to forecast the spread (cascades) of information that leads to the popularity of content throughout a social network. Online content tends to have bursts and spikes, experiencing a different cascading pattern depending on the viral propagation. In this paper, we propose and test a flexible framework capable of modelling such patterns and trends. We take temporal and network perspectives and develop a model based on the multivariate Hawkes processes that account for social behaviour and network elements such as follower counts, and activity variation observed in collective re-sharing behaviour. We focus on Twitter as the most widely used micro-blogging online social network and measure the popularity of a brand's tweet by analysing the time-series path of three types of subsequent activities (retweets (RTs), replies (REs) and likes (LKs)). The specific model that we propose in this paper is the multidimensional epidemic-type aftershock sequence (METAS) model, a particular case of the multivariate Hawkes process. It consists of a power-law relaxation governing the timing of activities. It also includes an exponential boost as a reinforcement mechanism for the response amplitude to model the impact of influential users on their followers. Earlier attempts to model online cascades have treated all online responses as one type of activity. Rather than aggregating all the activities into one stream, and therefore, ignoring exciting effects among different types of activities, we incorporate the activity variation into the predictive models of content popularity, explicitly accounting for such excitation effects. We develop epidemic-type mutually exciting Hawkes point processes models to quantify such effects and to predict more accurately the number of follow-up activities (i.e., RTs, REs and LKs) on a brand tweet after it is posted. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, as it is able to account for mutual excitations and cross-interactions between sequences of users’ activities from one type to another. These results are relevant for developing and executing a plan for online activities by the brand owners. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Brand post popularity; brand post popularity; Brand-generated content; Hawkes process; Online social networks; Social media","Earthquakes; Forecasting; Analytic; Brand post popularity; Brand-generated content; Hawkes process; Point process; Process-models; Revenue growth; Social contents; Social media; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122692282

As vulnerable road users, pedestrians and bicyclists are more likely to be injured or killed in accidents involving cars. Therefore, understanding the perceptions of vulnerable road users is crucial for developing and deploying AVs and solving public concerns because the acceptance of AVs relies on both AV users and other road users, such as vulnerable road users. This paper analyzed two surveys collected in 2017 and 2019 by BikePGH in Pittsburgh to understand vulnerable road users’ perceptions of AVs in different years. The analysis showed that vulnerable road users’ interactive experiences with AVs increased from 2017 to 2019 in Pittsburgh, and the interactive experiences with AVs positively affected vulnerable road users’ perceived safety and receptivity toward AVs in 2017 and 2019. Specifically, vulnerable road users’ perceived safety of AVs significantly increased from 2017 to 2019, while their receptivity toward AVs did not change significantly during that period. Additionally, autonomous driving accidents negatively affected vulnerable road users’ perceptions of AVs. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers provide opportunities for the public to interact with AVs and guarantee vulnerable road users’ safety and benefits in AV testing. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Autonomous vehicle; Interactive experience; Perceived safety, Receptivity; Public perception; Vulnerable road user","Accidents; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Safety testing; Surveys; Autonomous Vehicles; Comparative analyzes; Driver error; Interactive experience; Perceived safety, receptivity; Pittsburgh; Public perception; Road users; User perceptions; Vulnerable road user; Autonomous vehicles; accident; comparative study; cycle transport; pedestrian; perception; unmanned vehicle; vulnerability; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121921600

In an effort to convert this customer-to-firm engagement into customer-to-customer engagement, many firms have recently started to ask customers who reach the final question of the CSS to write an online review that will be automatically posted on a review site (e.g., Google or TripAdvisor). Using a unique longitudinal data set provided by a large global hotel chain, we aim to understand the drivers behind CSS participation and, ultimately, behind online review posting in response to a prompt at the end of a survey. We employ the Hidden Markov model (HMM) to analyze how a customer's engagement state changes as a function of previous managerial responses, loyalty program membership, and satisfaction. The results reveal that customers have a greater tendency to transfer to higher engagement states if managers have responded to prior customer surveys. We have also found that the higher the customer's loyalty program membership status is, the more likely it is that they will participate in a survey. Lastly, we show that customers have a greater tendency to post negative versus positive reviews. We then discuss the implications of this study for researchers and managers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,"Customer satisfaction; Hidden Markov models; Managers; Surveys; Customer loyalty programs; Customer satisfaction survey; Customer surveys; Data set; Google+; Hidden-Markov models; Longitudinal data; Managerial practices; Online reviews; States change; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120426396

There are no simple heuristic approaches to guide ordering decisions in these situations. In this paper, we introduce two near-optimal heuristics to guide replenishment decisions for the fixed lifetime perishable inventory problem with random transfers. Much like the traditional base stock policy, the heuristics are straightforward to calculate and implement. The first heuristic (H1) employs a base stock policy using the convolution of demand and transfer distributions. The second heuristic (H2) employs a transfer adjusted base stock policy. We validate our heuristics using inventory-related cost components (i.e., order, holding, wastage, and underage costs) and demand and transfer distributions based on data provided by a large university medical center. Via simulation, we evaluate the performance of the heuristics by comparing the total costs obtained using each heuristic to the total costs obtained using the optimal ordering policy. Both heuristics perform quite well. We conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses considering the effects of different (1) levels of holding and stockout costs, as these costs are difficult to quantify and can vary dramatically, and (2) percentile transfer adjustments in H2. We observe that the H1 policy consistently results in slightly larger orders than the optimal policy, which leads to a slightly higher inventory, holding costs and wastage rates, yet slightly lower stockout costs. The H2 policy, on the other hand, consistently results in slightly smaller orders than the optimal policy, which leads to a slightly smaller inventory, lower holding costs and wastage rates, yet slightly higher stockout costs. To guide decision making, we discuss a number of management challenges that we encountered as part of this project and offer a five-step process to help decision makers with replenishment decisions. © 2021","Blood management; Health care operations; Heuristic; Perishable inventory; Supply chain; Transfers","Blood; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Supply chains; Base stock policy; Blood management; Health care operations; Heuristic; Holding costs; Perishable inventory; Random transfer; Sensitivity analyzes; Stockout costs; Transfer; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118348525

This starts by computing indexes that describe the social, economic and environmental progress of countries, and continues by ranking and clustering countries that face similar sustainability challenges. Although multi-criteria methods exist to support this process, two main issues have not been addressed in an integrated approach: uncertainty in decision-making parameters and imprecise data sources. In this study, we propose a procedure in which the PROMETHEE II multi-criteria method is used for ranking countries and an iterative algorithm is applied to find ordered clusters. A stochastic robustness analysis procedure helps to identify groups with robust sustainability paths. The approach is applied to the Human Development Index and the Sustainable Development Goals Index. By analyzing the ambiguous assignments of nations to clusters three groups of countries can be identified. First, countries that have very good arguments to be considered in a given cluster. Second, countries which have some merits to be considered in a cluster and where focusing resources would allow them to improve in their current group or jumping into a better one. Third, nations that have very ambiguous arguments to be considered in any cluster such that the support to improve their performance would have to be analyzed in depth on multiple fronts. Thus, policy decision-making could be enhanced with this approach, providing new and helpful visualizations of nations in HDI and SDG.

Different from the conventional DEA strategy which aims to optimize the pollution reduction and economic production simultaneously in performance evaluation, a novel DEA method for modeling protection-after-production strategy is developed. This strategy sets a lower priority for pollution reduction in the DEA objective function. Both strategies reflect the differences in priorities for implementing pollution reduction and economic production in DEA modeling. Effectively capturing pollution reduction and post pollution cleaning effectively captures more real-world policy options and technologies. This study explores a PM2.5 related environmental performance comparison between simultaneous and protection-after-production strategies for China's 242 cities. Significant urban disparities in PM2.5 related environmental performance are observed in China. PM2.5 concentration reduction should be accentuated in Chinese eastern area, especially for cities in circum-Bohai-Sea region. Based on the stochastic environmental performance comparison between both strategies, it is reasonable to adopt the simultaneous strategy to reduce emissions in some economically developed cities. The protection-after-production strategy is more economical than the simultaneous strategy for most cities; a result obtainable only through the critical contribution of this paper.

In this paper, we present a mechanism for accepting/rejecting user requests in a Demand Responsive Transportation (DRT) context based on the representative utilities of alternative transportation modes. We consider utility-maximising users and propose a mixed-integer programming formulation for a Chance Constrained DARP (CC-DARP), that captures users’ preferences via a Logit model. We further introduce class-based user groups and consider various pricing structures for DRT services. A customised local search based heuristic and a matheuristic are developed to solve the proposed CC-DARP. We report numerical results for both DARP benchmarking instances and a realistic case study based on New York City yellow taxi trip data. Computational experiments performed on 105 benchmarking instances with up to 96 nodes yield average profit gaps of 2.59% and 0.17% using the proposed local search heuristic and matheuristic, respectively. The results obtained on the realistic case study reveal that a zonal fare structure is the best strategy in terms of optimising revenue and ridership.

However, this can pose risks for the firms’ long-term viability and profitability. Here, we examine the short-term financial effects of the sale of different product-service combinations. We use the event study methodology to investigate the stock market reaction to 1025 new contract announcements by 41 large manufacturers from 1987 to 2016.679 of these announcements involve the sale of standalone products, while the remaining 346 are product-service deals which we classify as low-, medium- or high-risk depending on whether they involve the provision of product-oriented (or smoothing) services, use-oriented and adapting services, and result-oriented (or substituting) services, respectively. Our results indicate that equity investors react positively to announcements of low-risk service deals and pure product sales. In contrast, we do not find an overall significant market reaction to announcements of medium- and high-risk service deals, suggesting that shareholders are not generally confident in the value creating potential of these types of services. However, post-hoc analysis suggests that the abnormal returns to service deals are affected by both firm-specific (financial leverage and service infusion level) and contract-specific (duration and value) factors. We explain these findings by considering the complexities characterizing these types of services and the general lack of transparency in the agreed terms and pricing of service contracts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Abnormal returns; Event study; Services' risk; Servitization; Shareholder value","Commerce; Investments; Manufacture; Abnormal returns; Event studies; Market reactions; Product service; Risky business; Service provisions; Service' risk; Servitization; Shareholder values; Type of services; Shareholders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120636718

One criterion by which to evaluate these questions is economic performance. Using data on countries worldwide and constitutional adoptions from 1973 to 2017, we estimate the effect of constitutional entrenchment (rigidity) on economic growth. We employ matching methods to make causal inferences. The adoption of a constitution that is meaningfully more rigid than its predecessor defines a treatment. In our benchmark estimations (based on 19 treatments), post-treatment effects on growth are generally small and statistically insignificant. However, when we examine a subsample that excludes autocracies (13 treatments), post-treatment effects are always negative and sometimes statistically significant. The same is true when we exclude treatments associated with coups (12 treatments). Contrary to many scholars’ priors, the evidence suggests that, if anything (and based on the limited number of available treatments), greater entrenchment causes less economic growth. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Constitutional amendments; Constitutional rigidity; Constitutions; Economic development; Economic growth; Entrenchment; Matching methods; Political economy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119125298

Functional aspect of bus networks such as the fuel consumption and depreciation of buses and also spatial aspects of bus networks such as station and terminal locations or access rate to the buses are not proper conditions in most cities. Therefore, having an efficient method to evaluate the performance of bus lines by considering both functional and spatial aspects is essential. In this paper, we propose a new model for the bus terminal location problem using data envelopment analysis with multi-objective programming approach. In this model, we want to find efficient allocation patterns for assigning stations terminals, and also we investigate the optimal locations for deploying terminals. Hence, we use a genetic algorithm for solving our model. By using the simultaneous combination of data envelopment analysis and bus terminal location problem, two types of efficiencies are optimized: Spatial efficiency as measured by finding allocation patterns with the most serving amount and the terminals’ efficiency in serving demands as measured by the data envelopment analysis efficiency score for selected allocation patterns. This approach is useful when terminals’ efficiency is one of the important criteria in choosing the optimal terminals location for decision-makers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bus terminal location problem; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Genetic algorithm; Multi objective programming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113742751

The development of oilseed cover crops can eliminate the side effect of ILUCs for biofuel production because they come in rotation with the major crops with some savings in demand for new cropland. This study implemented Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and GTAP-BIO to estimate ILUC emissions values, the potentially available area, and total possible emissions savings of producing SAFs from carinata, camelina, and pennycress in the United States. The results suggest that: 1) the meals produced in conjunction with increases in Sustainable Aviation Fuel production from carinata, camelina, and pennycress could reduce land use emissions by 12.9, 15.3, and 18.3 gCO2e/MJ, respectively; 2) the total area of available land for producing these feedstocks could be about 29.3 million ha in 2035; and 3) using this area of land for SAF production, depends on the mix of oilseed cover crops that can be produced in practice, could generate up to 92 million metric tons of savings in GHG emissions per year. The projected emissions savings is about 11% of the current global GHG emissions generated by the aviation industry. Providing incentives to encourage farmers to produce these cover crops and facilitating investment in producing SAF from these cover crops are the most important factors that could help the aviation industry to enhance emissions savings.

The impact of these factors is examined here in relation to the profile of 14 Canadian organizations to investigate factors that influence CCT practices. Design/methodology/approach: This research involves a survey of 150 employees at 14 industries in British Columbia (BC) Canada to review and analyze their perceptions of factors that impact CCT. Findings: Results demonstrate the potential for enhancing the use of CCT by organizations. It was shown that organizations perceive that CCT enhances their competitive advantage, which is an incentive that needs further investigation as having potential for encouraging CCT and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Research limitations/implications: Due to limited funding and workforce, as well as geographical constraints, only 14 industrial organizations were engaged in this research in BC Canada. The scope of future research needs to be enlarged by considering neighboring countries such as the USA and Mexico. This research regarding factors that impact organizations in adopting carbon crediting trading has the potential to provide and shape inter-continental comparisons. Practical implications: This study illustrates how CCT has the potential to enhance competitive advantage and may impact the industry toward reducing GHG emissions through CCT. This concept adds a new environmental protection factor and dimension to trade and industry. As organizations plan to invest funds in different carbon reduction projects this may result in expanded employment opportunities. Social implications: Organizations are interested in CCT but may hesitate in engaging in CCT as it can be a complex procedure. In addition to further research, workshops and seminars regarding CCT and dissemination of research should be organized by the universities, related authorities and government organizations to make CCT more known and feasible. This study shows that financial and non-financial benefits may be gained by any organization when involved in CCT. Larger advertising and information campaigns may motivate more organizations in this regard. Originality/value: This study extends the study of Garg et al. (2017) regarding challenges for CCT practices. International Journal of Management, 10(1), 85–96.

Little is known though about how the pandemic has impacted on supporting, managing and governing events in municipal (i.e., local) authorities as key stakeholders, nor how events have featured in the opening-up of localities. This paper reports on empirical research with senior events officers for local authorities in the UK on these key knowledge gaps. Specifically, it examines events officers' unfolding experiences of the pandemic. The paper points to unpreparedness for a crisis of this scale and magnitude, and the roles of innovation, adaptation and co-production in the emergent response. It highlights the transformative nature of the pandemic through reconsiderations of the purpose of public sector involvement in events and, from a policy perspective, how relatively smaller-scale, more agile and lower-risk arts events and performances can figure in local recovery. Finally, while the effects on, and response of, the body corporate (the local authority) to crises is an obvious focus, it is important to recognise those of the individuals who manage the response and drive change.

While the prediction performance has obviously improved, some models have become too complex to understand, and these models are called black-box models. Detecting the feature interactions is a useful technique to gain insight into the structure of black-box models. In this paper, we propose a method based on high dimensional model representation (HDMR) to reveal the structure of prediction models by detecting the feature interactions that are embedded in the models. The HDMR-based method can detect the k-way interactions without any constraints on k and can detect the interactions from both classification and regression models. Moreover, this method is model-agnostic and can detect both global and local interactions. Experiments on some synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the HDMR-based method can detect feature interactions effectively and improve the model interpretability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Black box; Feature interaction; High dimensional model representation; Model interpretation","Feature extraction; Regression analysis; Black box modelling; Black boxes; Feature interactions; High dimensional model representation; High-dimensional model representations; Interaction detection; Machine learning models; Model interpretations; Prediction modelling; Prediction performance; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120348582

This paper aims to and achieves a mutually beneficial balance between research and practice by providing generalizable methods to a problem routinely encountered in practice. Overall, the development and execution of the heterogeneous capacitated helicopter routing problem with split deliveries and multiple depots is validated by the networks’ results. Design/methodology/approach: Using a unique sample of deepwater and ultra-deepwater permanent offshore locations in the Gulf of Mexico, transportation networks consisting of 57 locations operated by 19 firms are optimized via a randomized greedy algorithm. The study’s randomized greedy algorithm yields depot assignment, vehicle assignment, passenger assignment and routing. All data processing techniques and iterative algorithm processes are defined and explained. Findings: Results show that the model effectively solves the complex transportation networks consisting of subject firms’ offshore nodes and eligible depots. Specifically, average load factors related to seat capacity and effective vehicle capacity of 87.7 and 95.7% are realized, respectively. The study’s model is a unique contribution to the extant literature and provides researchers and practitioners a practical approach to model development and solution deliverance. Research limitations/implications: The extant literature encompasses works that inadequately observe the complexity associated with the transportation of personnel. Specifically, this research, unlike many works in the extant literature, uses a heterogeneous versus homogeneous fleet, includes multiple depots versus a single depot and allows split deliveries. Also, the current research ensures all relevant aircraft capabilities and limitations are observed. In particular, the paper takes into account vehicles’ seat capacities, effective capacities via maximum gross takeoff weights and reserve fuel requirements. The current model, which is built upon a heterogeneous capacitated helicopter routing problem with split deliveries and multiple depots (HCHRPSDMD), sufficiently provides a practical approach to model development and solution deliverance while promoting future research endeavors. Future research may use these findings for other geographical regions and similar transportation networks and could adopt firm-specific actual cost parameters instead of the estimated average hourly costs of operating different helicopters. Furthermore, future endeavors may employ other techniques for the derivation of solutions. Future works may be enhanced with actual cost data in lieu of estimations. In the current study, cost data were not available; however, estimations do not inherently proscribe sound interpretations of the models’ outputs. Also, future research endeavors including manual method results may enable comparative results to establish cost variance analysis. Although the current study is, to some extent, limited, the practicality for practitioners and contribution to researchers is comprehensible. Due to the idiosyncrasies and complexity prevalent in modern transportation networks, optimization is and will continue to be a rich opportunity for implementation and research. Practical implications: As described by previous researchers, energy firms may more efficiently use their contracted aircraft via implementation of a decision-making mechanism for passenger assignment, aircraft selection, depot selection and aircraft routing. Most energy firms possess numerous and spatially segregated offshore facilities and, therefore, are unable to efficiently and effectively make such decisions. Ultimately, the efficient use of firms’ contracted helicopters can enhance profitability via reduced costs without compromising operational performance. Reduced costs are likely to be realized by a potential workforce or workload reduction, reduced flight hours and enhanced bargaining power with commercial helicopter operators. Specifically, enhanced bargaining power may be realized as a result of minimized depots from which the aircraft are operated and an overall reduction of aircraft via increased asset utilization. In essence, the efficient use of commercial helicopters may yield systemic efficiencies that can be shared among all stakeholders, contracting energy firms and commercial helicopter operators. The achievement of operational efficiencies, ultimately, may determine the realization of target performance or solvency of a plethora of firms in the future (Krishnan et al., 2019). Social implications: For economies, communities and industries depending on crude oil and natural gas production, people’s livelihoods are significantly impacted due to price fluctuations (Rostan and Rostan, 2020; Solaymani, 2019). Based on a unique set of inputs and outputs, the International Energy Agency region (IEA), which includes the current study’s sample set, was found to achieve greater overall production efficiency relative to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) (Ohene-Asare et al., 2018). Therefore, enhanced logistics efficiency within the energy industry’s transportation sector across the globe is reasonably likely. For countries relying on these commodities’ exportation, production efficiency is and will continue to be a priority. With limited resources available in industry and society, efficiency is prone to yield advantageous results for all stakeholders. Furthermore, in the context of this study, a reduction of carbon dioxide and noise pollution in air, above water and on land will contribute to society’s drive to protect the environment and preserve our natural resources for future generations. Originality/value: The current study represents the lone or one of few research endeavors to evaluate the heterogeneous capacitated helicopter routing problem with split deliveries and multiple depots. Furthermore, research pertaining to transportation via helicopter in the Gulf of Mexico’s offshore basin is unprecedented. Lastly, this work yields actionable knowledge for practitioners while enhancing current and promoting future research endeavors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Air transport - domestic; Cost minimization; Decision-making; Distribution; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Transport","Aircraft seats; Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Complex networks; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Crude oil price; Data handling; Decision making; Digital storage; Gas industry; Gasoline; Geographical regions; Helicopters; Iterative methods; Location; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Noise pollution; Offshore oil well production; Transportation personnel; Vehicles; Water pollution; Data processing techniques; Decision-making mechanisms; Design/methodology/approach; International energy agency; Oil and natural gas productions; Operational efficiencies; Operational performance; Transportation network; Petroleum industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113877246

However, this presents a unique challenge for emerging and developing countries. As the technical and financial issues remain a significant barrier in implementing RE projects, several mechanisms are available to aid the financial aspect of investing and implementing clean energy projects. This paper aims to discuss new and traditional trends in the financial area of renewable investment, focusing on the Dominican Republic (DR), identifying the gaps in the financial area regarding RE. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted in the DR. This country is located at the heart of the Caribbean. Given the complexity of RE and developing countries issues and the scarcity of comparable research in the area, an interpretivist research paradigm along with the qualitative methodology was adopted. Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The study sample includes: directors, chief executive officers and managers responsible for the implementation of RE strategies in their respective departments/organisations. NVivo software was used for data management and the collected data was analysed using content analysis. Findings: The research highlighted several severe financial handicaps regarding RE in the DR: The lack of RE assets recognition; lack of RE investment loans; perceived RE risk; and lack of financial guarantor. After extensive interviews with critical actors in the RE sector in the DR, the possible solutions and recommendations for avoiding locking the energy and economic sector in fossil fuel debt are: (a) diversification of RE technology assets recognition, (b) implementation of government RE fund, (c) RE education on all actors and (d) introduction and adoption of new financial trends such as green bonds, bank pooling, cooperatives and more. Originality/value: This paper provides information and knowledge related to financial tools and policies that are available for the RE projects in the DR. The results have a socio-economic impact. This research provides a better understanding of the key financial tools to be explored by RE project developers in the developing countries.

GDP per capita represents economic growth while oil price, general index, trade openness, government spending, corruption perceptions index, and worldwide governance indicators were used as governance parameters in this study. The Saudi Arabian economy has gone through various reform initiatives resulting redefining and refitting economic activities in areas like the ownership structure of companies, the overreliance on petroleum sector, measures addressed in Vision 2030.

Findings indicate evidence for the supply leading theory (Hurlin & Venet, 2008; McKinnon, 1973; Patrick, 1966; Shaw, 1973): financial development causes economic growth overall, especially when private credit was used as the proxy for it. Yet, we observed bi-directional links when financial development was proxied by broad money. Furthermore, interest spread affected economic growth. The findings also indicate a positive relationship between broad money and private credit taken together to GDP growth, but only in the first lag; in the second lag, the inverse effect of broad money and private credit on GDP growth became evident. On a comparative scale, private credit was found to have a bigger impact on GDP than broad money.

However, prior studies suggest that individuals resist such innovative technology. In contrast to prior studies that investigate individuals’ decisions for themselves, we focus on family members’ rejection of AI monitoring, as family members play a significant role in health care decisions. Our research investigates competing effects of emotions toward the rejection of AI monitoring for health care. Based on two scenario-based experiments, our study reveals that emotions play a decisive role in family members’ decision making on behalf of their parents. We find that anxiety about health care monitoring and anxiety about health outcomes reduce the rejection of AI monitoring, whereas surveillance anxiety and delegation anxiety increase rejection. We also find that for individual-level risks, perceived controllability moderates the relationship between surveillance anxiety and the rejection of AI monitoring. We contribute to the theory of Information System rejection by identifying the competing roles of emotions in AI monitoring decision making. We extend the literature on decision making for others by suggesting the influential role of anxiety. We also contribute to healthcare research in Information System by identifying the important role of controllability, a design factor, in AI monitoring rejection. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, how they react to news of different nature and whether their reactions influence the stock market is far from clear. Employing data on financial news, tweets posted by firms and investors, and daily stock prices, we find that firms are more responsive to news with positive sentiment and low uncertainty, whereas investors are more responsive to news with high uncertainty. Moreover, the increased tweeting activities of firms and investors can improve the stock returns of firms. We further show that investors’ social media reactions to news and the subsequent influence on stock returns depend on firm size.

Aim: We consider three research questions about globalisation: (i) does globalisation heighten economic growth? (ii) is there a statistically significant threshold level of globalisation above which globalisation affects growth differently than at lower levels? (iii) what factors moderate the globalisation-economic growth nexus? Setting: A panel of 47 selected countries from Africa from 2001 to 2018 is under scrutiny. Method: To begin, it applies an overlapping five-year moving average (MA) to smoothen the data. In addition, we employ the revised globalisation index and the two-step systems generalised method of the moment (GMM) in its empirical strategy. Results: We find a largely insignificant relationship between globalisation and economic growth. We attribute these results to Africa’s infinitesimal share – less than 5% – in foreign direct investment (FDI) and global trade, acute infrastructure deficit and the lack of relevant skills that lead to productivity losses and weak performance within the international business ecosystem. We also find, among others, that globalisation is more effective in countries with more gross capital formation, higher population and urban growth rates. Conclusion: For Africa to maximise its growth potential from globalisation, sound policies should be put in place to promote trade, FDI, domestic capital formation and urbanisation. We suggest that future studies investigate the long-run equilibrium relationship between globalisation and economic growth. © 2022.

A public health survey informs model parametrization, and analytical findings guide the computational design of the decision-making process. The potential impact of jail-based screen-treat (S-T) programs on community health outcomes is presented. Numerical experiments are conducted for a case study population to quantify the effect and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of considered interventions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of increased jail S-T rates on community cases when resources for a community S-T program stays constant. Although this effect decreases when higher S-T rates are in place, jail-based S-T programs are cost-effective relative to community-based programs. Summary of Contribution: Public health programs have been developed to control community-wide infectious diseases and to reduce prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). These programs can consist of screening and treatment of diseases and behavioral interventions. Public correctional facilities play an important role in operational execution of these public health programs. However, because of lack of capacity and resources, public health programs using correctional facilities are questioned by policy-makers in terms of their costs and benefits. In this article, we present an analytical framework using a computational epidemiology model for supporting public health policy making. The system represents the dynamics of Chlamydia trachomatis transmission in two interacting populations, with an ordinary differential equations-based simulation model. The theoretical epidemic control conditions are derived and numerically tested, which guide the design of simulation experiments. Then cost-effectiveness of the potential policies is analyzed. We also present an extensive sensitivity analyses on model parameters. This study contributes to the computational epidemiology literature by presenting an analytical framework to guide effective simulation experimentation for policy decision making. The presented methodology can be applied to other complex policy and public health problems.

Traditional volatility-forecasting methods primarily rely on stochastic models. More recently, many machine-learning approaches, particularly text-mining techniques, have been implemented to predict stock return volatility, thus taking advantage of the availability of large amounts of unstructured data such as firm financial reports. Most existing studies develop simple but effective models to analyze text, such as dictionary-based matching algorithms that use a set of manually constructed keywords**. However, the latent and deep semantics encoded in text are usually neglected. In this study, we build on recent progress in representation learning and propose a novel word-embedding method that incorporates external knowledge from a well-known finance-domain lexicon (the Loughran and McDonald word list), which helps us learn semantic relationships among words in firm reports for better volatility prediction. Using over 10 years of annual reports from Russell 3000 firms, we empirically show that, compared with cutting-edge benchmarks, our proposed method achieves significant improvement in terms of prediction error, for example, a 28.4% reduction on average. We also discuss the practical and methodological implications of our findings. Our financial-specific word-embedding program is available as open-source information so that researchers can use it to analyze financial reports and assess financial risks. Summary of Contribution: Predicting stock return volatility is the key to investment and risk management. Traditional volatility-forecasting methods primarily rely on stochastic models. More recently, many machine-learning, especially text-mining, techniques have been developed to predict stock return volatility given the availability of a large amount of unstructured data, such as firm annual reports. Most existing research develops simple but effective approaches, for example, manually constructing a set of keywords to analyze texts. However, the latent and deep semantics encoded in texts are usually ignored. In this research, we build on recent progress in representation learning and propose a novel word-embedding method that incorporates external knowledge from the finance-domain lexicon of Loughran and McDonald word list, which helps us learn the semantic relationships among words in firm annual reports for better volatility prediction. In this study, we make the following contributions. First, methodologically, we are among the first to incorporate finance-specific lexicon into representation learning for stock volatility prediction. We propose a novel knowledge-driven text-embedding model that is trained on a large amount of unstructured textual data to learn high quality word embedding. Our proposed approach is effective in predicting stock return volatility, and the approach can potentially have broader applications. Second, substantively, we empirically show that the domain lexicon enhanced text representation learning can indeed significantly improve the performance, compared with bag-of-words models and generic word embedding for volatility prediction. Domain knowledge combined with text learning plays a critical enabling role in understanding financial reports. Third, our method adds on to existing literature on designing financial information systems by incorporating ontology knowledge, commonsense knowledge, and general prior knowledge.

These barriers include high initial investment costs, misaligned financial incentives among stakeholders, and the relatively low cost of less sustainable energy and materials. A Product-Service Systems (PSS) approach could successfully overcome many of these barriers by (1) outsourcing capital investment, as well as financial and technical risks, (2) providing shared economic incentives to collaborating stakeholders, and (3) retaining extended producer responsibility and ownership over materials and products. However, PSS is still not seen as a viable business model when compared to both a standard “ownership” contract and a “no-retrofit” scenario. This paper proposes a Total Value of Ownership (TVO) method to evaluate the financial performance of a building energy retrofit in terms of Net Present Value, comparing a matrix of scenarios. Results show that–when accounting for capital and opportunity costs tied to alternative investments, internalising externalities, and monetising soft values such as user productivity and property value–a PSS model can deliver the highest NPV. Furthermore, results show that a PSS alternative can act as a positive future-proofing strategy to safeguard the building owner’s position in the face of uncertain future market indicators and carbon taxation. Recommendations for policymakers, investors, financiers, building owners, and end-users are presented to identify the economic value of PSS contracts, leading to better-informed decisions which can accelerate deep energy retrofit of the building stock. © 2022 The Author(s).

Positioning our work in the B2B logistics services context, we take a customer needs fulfillment perspective to understand value creation and capture from digitalization of service orchestration in B2B logistics relationships. We suggest that a vendor will capture exchange value, manifesting as customer loyalty, for the customer’s perceived use value of the service enabled by tracking information quality on service orchestration. We propose that service flexibility and service efficiency provided by the logistics vendor are two types of use value for customers, which serve as the value-creation pathways through which tracking information quality affects customer loyalty, the exchange value received by the vendor. We further argue that service modal variety, a key aspect of service complexity, moderates the value-creation pathways of tracking information quality. Using survey and archival data of B2B relationships between a Fortune 100 logistics vendor and its major customers, we find empirical support for the use value mechanisms through which tracking information quality affects customer loyalty in the context of B2B logistics services. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","B2B logistics; customer loyalty; customer loyalty; digitalization; exchange value; service complexity; service orchestration; Tracking information quality; use value","Sales; B2B logistic; Customer loyalty; Digitalization; Exchange value; Information quality; Service complexity; Service orchestration; Tracking information quality; Use value; Information analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131361240

The number of data centers continue to increase to meet this demand, consuming 2 percent of the energy produced worldwide. Many organizations moving towards cloud computing due to its ability to meet users’ needs on demand. Greening cloud computing technology has become an important aspect of an organization’s design and use of cloud computing. One aspect of greening the cloud is through efficiently using cloud-based resources. In this study, we focus on the resource allocation applications of cloud computing technologies to green an organizations cloud. We design a pricing and allocation mechanism for a private cloud computing service that allows the firm to effectively load balance their cloud computing resources. Our optimal pricing mechanism is a dynamic pricing model, which maximizes the net value of users in a private cloud computing service. Additionally, we create a job allocation algorithm based on our dynamic pricing model to load balance the cloud. We show that balancing the job allocation such that the number of jobs at individual resource servers as close to equal as possible is optimal. Furthermore, simulations were run on the allocation mechanism to examine the effects on the cloud resources while gaining insight to effectively distribution resources to public clouds. Our model can help organizations to efficiently distribute their cloud-based resources, which allows for a greener cloud computing system. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cloud computing; Green IT; load balancing; optimal allocation","Costs; Dynamics; Economics; Green computing; Allocation mechanism; Cloud computing services; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud-based; Cloud-computing; Green information technology; Load-Balancing; Optimal allocation; Pricing mechanism; Private clouds; Cloud computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131360870

In this research, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is used to quantify the impact on daily flow profiles of cyclists due to the public's response to different levels of restrictions during a 6-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. An inductive loop network in Tyne and Wear, the UK provided cycle flow data from 25 sites. A paired sample t-Test was carried out between the ""Pre-COVID-19""baseline year and 2020 to determine how cycling volumes changed at each site. The HCA was then performed on the diurnal hourly flow profiles to observe how they changed within the same time period. Finally, the relationship between diurnal flow profile and volume was assessed. Overall cycling volume in the study area increased by 38% during the lockdown. The highest increases were found at coastal sites, with more modest increases in suburban areas and reduced volumes at city center locations. The HCA of the diurnal flow profiles revealed that locations associated with noncommuting-shaped flows witnessed the largest increases while commuting profiles saw a decrease. As lockdown restrictions eased, flow profiles began to revert back to the prepandemic norm but never fully returned to prepandemic levels. The adoption of working from home postpandemic will change commuting behavior. The conclusions drawn from this study suggest consideration of noncommuting trips should be made when planning the design and location of future cycling schemes, and the HCA of flow profiles can assist in this decision-making process as a method to quantify changes in daily flow profiles of cycling. © 2022 Matthew Burke et al.",,"Behavioral research; Cluster analysis; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Locks (fasteners); Cycle flows; Flow data; Flow profile; Flow volumes; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Inductive loops; Loop networks; Paired-sample t-test; Time-periods; Travel behaviour; Location",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131152084

If high-achieving faculty members are simply taking advantage of the availability of internal funds to boost their already high rates of productivity, internal programs designed to support the formation of novel teams and to enhance the impact of an institution’s research portfolio may not be advancing their objectives. In this study, we examine whether applicants to an interdisciplinary funding program are already more productive than other faculty members, including those who apply for traditional (non-interdisciplinary) internal funding support. Data were drawn from several sources: Academic Analytics, which provides productivity data that allows for comparisons of faculty members within fields; the Office of the Vice Provost for Research’s data on internal funding program applications; the Office of Research Administration’s data on external grant proposal submissions; data from an internal survey on perceptions of the university’s research climate; and Scopus, which provides individual faculty members’ h-indices and lists of publications and citations. Results indicate that faculty members who join interdisciplinary research teams and are awarded internal funding are not more or less likely to be “superstars.” This not only provides support for assertions that interdisciplinary programs can lead to team innovation and professional growth of individual faculty members, but also provides a blueprint for the establishment of baseline measures that can be used to help evaluate the impact of internal funding programs. © 2022, Society of Research Administrators International.

It follows an inductive approach, analyzing within-case findings, identifying cross-case commonalities, and inducing propositions. Findings show that there is no consistent definition of location privacy, with each local government developing its own definition and attendant approaches to privacy policymaking, management, and protection.

We study two types of information nudging: nudging through full and nudging through partial information provision. In the former, information nudges are provided to inform consumers of their usage status at every decision point in a billing cycle. In contrast, in the latter, consumers are nudged at one or more decision points within a billing cycle but not throughout the billing cycle. Our model considers two dimensions of consumer heterogeneity: inattentiveness and preference. Furthermore, our model investigates an important but under-investigated design element of information nudges, namely, the timing of the information nudges. We find that (1) nudging through information provision influences inattentive consumers’ usage decisions and improves consumption efficiency, (2) consumers’ welfare gains from full information nudging depict an inverted-U shape contingent on consumers’ preference heterogeneity, and (3) the timing of nudging matters.

As a result, the past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of seller-initiated misrepresentation of quality through fake reviews, fake sales, and fake posts. We develop an analytical model to investigate sellers’ competition in quality misrepresentation in agency pricing and the platform’s policies. The platform can discourage sellers’ quality misrepresentations by increasing the cost of misrepresentation or implementing a more lenient product return policy. We find that while a stricter anti-misrepresentation policy deters the misrepresentation of the high-quality seller, such a strategy may unintendedly incentivize the low-quality seller to misrepresent the quality more. Furthermore, increasing return leniency deters low-quality seller’s misrepresentation in a wider range of market conditions than increasing the misrepresentation cost. We show sellers’ online quality misrepresentation behaviors in a competitive setting, and our results have practical implications for platform policies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","agency selling; analytical modeling; E-commerce platforms; online platforms; online reviews; platform policies; product returns; quality misrepresentation","Analytical models; Electronic commerce; Quality control; Agency selling; Commerce platforms; E-commerce platform; Low qualities; Online platforms; Online quality; Online reviews; Platform policy; Product returns; Quality misrepresentation; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128350373

TVD has been adopted by the construction community to avoid project cost overruns while simultaneously improving value. TVD implementation involves a number of practices: clearly identify owner value, develop an inclusive interdisciplinary team organization, provide appropriate financial and contractual incentives, create a culture of respect, and steer to cost and value targets with TVD tools. While application of TVD has grown, not all results are as favourable as they might be. It is possible that TVD application may be piecemeal at times—potentially because the impacts of individual practices are unknown. This paper explores a fundamental research question: how consistent or inconsistent is the application of TVD principles, practices, and tools? To address this question, the authors reviewed 29 academic publications on TVD, surveyed 14 TVD practitioners through an anonymous on-line survey, and hosted two open-ended focus groups with 6 TVD facilitators. Results indicate that some—but not all—TVD practices are consistently being implemented, which may suggest one cause for observed variability of outcomes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaboration; contracts; culture; integrated project delivery; lean construction; Target Value design; tools; value","Lean production; Project management; 'current; Collaboration; Culture; Design practice; Design tool; Integrated project deliveries; Lean construction; Target costing; Target value designs; Value; Surveys; construction; culture; organization; project design; project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126800813

However, little is known about which of these practices are implemented and how their combined implementation might impact KPIs. The objectives of this research are to identify perceptions of CS practices that drive project performance, define CS practices used by industry that impact KPIs, and establish practices that are more commonly implemented and have a higher potential to positively impact KPIs. The research team conducted a nationwide survey in the United States and obtained 241 usable responses. Utilizing an information theory approach to measure the uncertainty of implementation and impact of each practice, the research built a set of Chow–Liu tree models to determine the most efficient sequence of actions to improve CS. Results indicate that meeting owners’ expectation throughout the life-cycle of the project from design through construction and commissioning, using the schedule to support a strong project culture, and an effective communication plan were the top CS levers for overall KPI improvement. An innovative method was developed to help construction project managers discover the value of each CS practice, the relation between CS practices, and CS practices’ influence to project KPIs so that managers can improve KPIs efficiently by prioritizing their CS practices according to their own project needs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Collaborative scheduling; information theory; practice; survey; uncertainty","Information theory; Life cycle; Managers; Scheduling; Surveys; Collaborative scheduling; Construction projects; High potential; Key performance indicators; Practice; Project performance; Research teams; Tree modeling; Uncertainty; Benchmarking; construction industry; industrial performance; prioritization; project management; survey; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126531392

This study collected 346 valid samples from an online survey and used structural equation modeling with AMOS version 22.0 to validate the proposed model. The results show that argument quality and source credibility have a significant and positive effect on vendor trust and trust-gaining information, respectively. Furthermore, source credibility has a higher effect on vendor trust and trust-gaining information than argument quality does. Vendor trust and trust-gaining information significantly and positively affect repurchase intention. Moreover, trust-gaining information has a higher effect on repurchase intention than vendor trust does. The positive effect of argument quality on vendor trust increases when the relationship strength increases. Conversely, the positive effect of argument quality on trust-gaining information and the positive effects of source credibility on vendor trust/trust-gaining information decrease when the relationship strength increases. Source credibility plays an important role of vendor trust and trust-gaining information. Online vendors encourage consumers to post current and objective information on their websites. Meanwhile, trust-gaining information is more important than vendor trust for repeat purchase intention. Online vendors should increase their expertise and knowledge about product information.

It shows how well an entity is using its resources to maximize shareholder’s wealth. Although a thorough assessment of a firm's financial performance takes into account many other measures, the most common performance measurement used in the area of finance are financial ratios. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the financial performance measurement literature related to the construction sector in Albania. The literature covers studies from Albania, Iran, India and Pakistan, but some international evidence has also been presented. The construction sector is chosen because of its impact on economic growth in Albania, it represents the second main sector according to its share effect on Albanian GDP. The financial ratios used to measure the financial performance of the construction sector are the debt ratio, the liquidity ratio and the profitability ratio from the period 2018-2020 for 100 construction companies in Albania. Return on Assets (ROA) is taken as the predictor variable and three financial ratios are taken as the predictive variables. This research reveals that the financial ratios have positive correlation with the dependent variable whereas the leverage ratio has negative correlation. To overcome the limitations of the forthcoming studies, the considered number of years need to be increased and other models such as Market Value Added, Capital Asset Pricing Model and Economic Value Added can be used to be tested for research to analyze other factors that may affect financial performance. © 2022, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Such dynamic resource allocation problems are challenging for two reasons. (a) The platform must strike a balance between optimizing the advertiser's own revenues and guaranteeing fairness to the advertiser's (repeat) buyers, and (b) the problem is inherently dynamic due to the uncertain, time-varying supply of goods available with the platform. We propose a stochastic approximation scheme akin to a dynamic market equilibrium. Our scheme relies on frequent resolves of an Eisenberg-Gale convex program and does not require the platform to have any knowledge about how the goods' arrival processes evolve over time. The scheme fully extracts buyer budgets (thus maximizing platform revenues) and at the same time provides a 0.64 approximation of the proportionally fair allocation of goods achievable in the offline case, as long as the supply of goods comes from a wide family of (possibly nonstationary) Gaussian processes. We then deal with amulti-objective problem where the platformis concerned with both the proportional fairness and efficiency of the allocation and propose a hybrid algorithm that achieves a 0.3 bicriteria guarantee against fairness and efficiency. Finally, we build a sequence of datasets, one public dataset released by the DSP iPinYou and the second based on real Google AdX data, and use them to test the empirical performance of our schemes. We find that across these datasets there is a surprising relationship between fairness and efficiency that can be used to tune the schemes to nearly optimal performance in practice. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This study investigates optimal patient enrollment in clinical trials with interim analyses, which are analyses of treatment responses from patients at intermediate points. Our model considers uncertainties in patient enrollment and drug treatment effectiveness. We consider the benefits of completing a trial early and the cost of accelerating a trial by maximizing the net present value of drug cumulative profit. Academic/practical relevance: Clinical trials frequently account for the largest cost in drug development, and patient enrollment is an important problem in trial management. Our study develops a dynamic program, accurately capturing the dynamics of the problem, to optimize patient enrollment while learning the treatment effectiveness of an investigated drug. Methodology: The model explicitly captures both the physical state (enrolled patients) and belief states about the effectiveness of the investigated drug and a standard treatment drug. Using Bayesian updates and dynamic programming, we establish monotonicity of the value function in state variables and characterize an optimal enrollment policy. We also introduce, for the first time, the use of backward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) for this problem class. We illustrate the findings using a clinical trial program from a leading firm. Our study performs sensitivity analyses of the input parameters on the optimal enrollment policy. Results: The value function is monotonic in cumulative patient enrollment and the average responses of treatment for the investigated drug and standard treatment drug. The optimal enrollment policy is nondecreasing in the average response from patients using the investigated drug and is nonincreasing in cumulative patient enrollment in periods between two successive interim analyses. The forward ADP algorithm (or backward ADP algorithm) exploiting the monotonicity of the value function reduced the run time from 1.5 months using the exact method to a day (or 20 minutes) within 4% of the exact method. Through an application to a leading firm’s clinical trial program, the study demonstrates that the firm can have a sizable gain of drug profit following the optimal policy that our model provides. Managerial implications: We developed a new model for improving the management of clinical trials. Our study provides insights of an optimal policy and insights into the sensitivity of value function to the dropout rate and prior probability distribution. A firm can have a sizable gain in the drug’s profit by managing its trials using the optimal policies and the properties of value function. We illustrated that firms can use the ADP algorithms to develop their patient enrollment strategies.

Academic/Practical Relevance: With increasing bipartisan scrutiny of federal spending in technology programs and continuing debate in the media about their execution, a nuanced understanding of the drivers of baseline changes in federal technology programs is a critical and contemporary line of inquiry relevant to both policymakers and managers. Our study also responds to recent calls in the operations management literature for research on public sector operations. Methodology: The study sample comprises detailed archival data on 240 U.S. federal government technology programs across 24 federal agencies. We estimate a negative binomial regression specification that accounts for agency fixed effects and several program-specific characteristics to test four hypotheses on the interrelationships between a program’s scope, granularity, management competency, execution methodology and baseline changes.. Results: The results indicate that program scope is positively associated with the number of baseline changes. However, increasing levels of program granularity and program management competency attenuate this positive relationship. Additional analysis highlights the significant savings in taxpayer contributions that can occur by reducing baseline changes in programs of greater scope through an increase in the levels of program granularity and program management competency. Managerial Implications: The study results emphasize the need for federal agencies to invest greater efforts in granularizing a program and in identifying managers with high levels of program management competency when program scope is high, as such efforts can translate into a reduction in the number of baseline changes. The results also highlight the role of number of baseline changes as a valuable in-process metric for program managers and federal agencies to monitor the execution of federal technology programs and identify programs with greater potential. for experiencing cost overruns.

This asymmetric sensitivity is strongest for young CEOs and those with the shortest tenure. Also, future repurchases are more sensitive to past repurchase losses for CEOs whose previous lifetime experience with the stock market is unfavorable. The sensitivity of future repurchases to past losses costs firms, on average, about 3.7% per year. When this cost is decomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic components, we find that nearly half (1.8%) comes from mistiming idiosyncratic shocks. Past losses on repurchases have a significant and negative impact on the CEO's future bonus and increase the likelihood that future CEO termination is involuntary. We also find that negative outcomes from past repurchases encourage the subsequent use of dividends. Our findings suggest that outcomes of past repurchases have economically significant consequences through both nonbehavioral (career concerns) and behavioral (snakebite effect) factors. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Despite this, no guiding framework has been developed for the application of blockchain and related technologies in the use of certificating systems that issue sharable and authentic student credentials. Existing certificating systems are marked by their lack of speed and low reliability and, in certain education systems, they produce social and cultural conflicts. Therefore, this paper offers an analysis of blockchain adoption in this field, focusing especially on the process of producing and sharing higher education certificates. The paper describes the second phase of an ongoing research project by presenting a certificate validation and sharing framework that guarantees authenticity through leveraging the privacy and security features of a blockchain network. The framework also covers the architectural design of a blockchain-based certificating system to solve problems and offer solutions in the context of higher education. Two groups of participants are also included in an empirical study focusing on an evaluation of the proposed framework in relation to its ability to describe and explain blockchain adoption in higher education. The validity and reliability of the framework is tested using a sequential mixed methods design involving the collection of quantitative survey data. It is expected that the proposed framework will have useful applications in different fields where it is necessary to determine whether a satisfactory level of blockchain technology has been maintained in accordance with relevant privacy and security standards. Finally, this study is about attitudes towards the technology and theory of acceptance by users, students and prospective employers, rather than a technological development study. © 2022 University of Bahrain.

This approach relies mainly on traditional data sources (e.g. surveys and interviews) for identifying those positive deviants and for discovering their successful solutions. The growing availability of non-traditional digital data (e.g. from remote sensing and mobile phones) relating to individuals, communities and spaces enables data innovation opportunities for positive deviance. Such datasets can identify deviance at geographic and temporal scales that were not possible before. But guidance is needed on how this new data can be employed in the positive deviance approach, and how it can be combined with more traditional data to gain deeper, more meaningful, and context-aware insights. This paper presents such guidance through a data powered method that combines both traditional and non-traditional data to identify and understand positive deviance in new ways and domains. This method has been developed iteratively through six development projects covering five different domains – sustainable cattle ranching, agricultural productivity, rangeland management, research performance, crime control – with global and local development partners in six countries. The projects combine different types of non-traditional data with official statistics, administrative data and interviews. Here, we describe a structured method for data powered positive deviance developed from the experience of these projects, and we reflect on lessons learned. We hope to encourage and guide greater use of this new method; enabling development practitioners to make more effective use of the non-traditional digital datasets that are increasingly available. © 2021","Data science; Global south; High performers; International development; Mixed methods; Non-traditional data; Positive deviance","Air navigation; Productivity; Remote sensing; Data-source; Digital datas; Global south; High performer; International development; Mixed method; Non-traditional; Non-traditional data; Positive deviance; Remote-sensing; Iterative methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121963887

Here we study voluntary climate action (VCA), which is costly to today’s decision-makers but essential to enable sustainable living for future generations. We predict that “offspring observability” is critical: parents will be more likely to invest in VCA when their own offspring observes their action, whereas when adults or genetically unrelated children observe them, the effect will be smaller. In a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment, we observe a remarkable magnitude of VCA: parents invest 82% of their 69€ endowment into VCA, resulting in almost 14,000 real trees being planted. Parents’ VCA varies across conditions, with the largest treatment effect occurring when a parent’s own child is the observer. In subgroup analyses, we find that larger treatment effects occur among parents with a high school diploma. Moreover, VCA for parents who believe in climate change is most affected by the presence of their own child. In contrast, VCA of climate change skeptical parents is most influenced by the presence of children to whom they are not related.

Why do individuals engage in intergroup conflict as often as they do? We propose that groups’ tendencies to present intergroup conflict as the default option and individuals’ tendencies to disproportionately choose default options fuel individual participation in intergroup conflict. Three experiments (total N = 893) that used incentivized economic games found support for this hypothesis. Designating intergroup conflict as the default option significantly increased individual participation in conflict relative to a no-default condition and to designating other behavioral options as defaults. The effects of defaults on intergroup conflict generalized across different social identities and levels of group identification. Our findings explain the stickiness of conflict and identify choice architecture as a potential solution: changing existing defaults can redirect intergroup behavior.

We report a group liability microfinance lab experiment that tests a mechanism to raise repayment rates among such borrowers. The mechanism offers partial revenue sharing among groups of borrowers, agreed to before individual business outcomes are realized and loan repayment is due. Such revenue sharing makes loan repayment optimal under more outcome states, increasing the expected benefit to each borrower of repayment to qualify for future loans. We further test the effect of allowing borrowers to renege on revenue sharing agreements after learning their business outcomes, prior to loan repayment decisions. Our results illustrate the problem that exogenously higher risk/return borrowing groups achieve lower loan repayment rates than lower risk/return borrowing groups. We find evidence that optional revenue sharing significantly increases high risk borrowers’ repayment rates, but that most of this gain is lost if they can renege on revenue sharing agreements. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adverse selection; Microfinance; profit sharing; revenue sharing; risk","experimental study; financial services; microfinance; profitability; risk assessment; tolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116834348

This paper analyzes the level of greenness and price competition of duopoly manufacturers in the consumer market in which both green-sensitive consumers (salience to greenness) and price-sensitive consumers (salience to price) exist simultaneously according to salience theory. We find that the regular manufacturer will enter the green market when all consumers’ average degree of price responsiveness is small or in a moderate part of the region.

However, critical assessment of the fit of sophisticated models into a decision-making context is often hidden or overlooked. Using the case of a national infrastructure systems model, this paper connects conceptions of infrastructure governance to techno-economic modelling assessing future infrastructure performance. Analysis of modelling input to a UK national level infrastructure policy process demonstrates the importance of governance understanding within infrastructure modelling for policy and it highlights the risks of not explicitly considering governance assumptions. Going on to pursue a more integrated approach to infrastructure modelling and governance, socio-technical researchers embedded within a model development research project are able to observe model development, analyse an early policy application, and facilitate discussions and co-development work with modellers. A methodological framework, building on recent transitions research ‘bridging’ socio-technical and techno-economic approaches, for connecting infrastructure governance understanding into techno-economic modelling analyses is presented and its use within this UK infrastructure modelling project is discussed. The integrated approach taken and the methodological framework developed are potential tools for researchers working with techno-economic models to support policy decisions; they show potential for further research on infrastructure futures. © 2021","Governance; Infrastructure; Policy decisions; Socio-technical systems; Techno-economic modelling","Economic analysis; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Decisions makings; Governance; Infrastructure; Infrastructure modeling; Integrated approach; Model development; Policy decisions; Sociotechnical; Sociotechnical systems; Techno-economic model; Integrated control; decision making; modeling; policy analysis; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115611055

Drawing on attribution theory, we propose that multi-violator CSI disclosures artificially create “violator groups.” Such violator groups weaken the extent to which investors attribute each violator firm's CSI behaviors to the firm itself and subsequently lessen negative market reactions toward the violator firm. Further, the temporal consistency and context diversity of the focal firm's past CSI behaviors mitigate the relationship between CSI disclosure type (i.e., multi-violator vs. single-violator CSI disclosures) and stock market reactions. Empirical findings based on a sample of 1,369 CSI disclosures linked to 506 S&P 1500 firms between 2010 and 2017 support our hypotheses. Managerial Summary: Some public media reports disclose multiple firms' CSI behaviors together, while others disclose only one firm's CSI behaviors at a time. These two different frames can result in very different stock market reactions. We find that while the stock market reacts negatively to media reports of firms' CSI behaviors on average, negative reactions are weaker when the media discloses multiple firms' CSI behaviors than when only one firm's CSI behaviors are disclosed. However, this difference in market reactions to multi-violator versus single-violator CSI disclosures is smaller for firms that have engaged in many CSI behaviors or have engaged in many different types of CSI behaviors before. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","attribution theory; corporate social irresponsibility; media framing; multi-violator CSI disclosures; stock market reactions","Commerce; Financial markets; Empirical findings; Market reactions; Temporal consistency; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112397270

While the literature points to the need to build such linkages, no mechanism exists that reconciles never mind integrates stakeholders’ (often conflicting) views. Addressing these omissions, we propose that there is a need for a framework that (1) reconciles and integrates the often conflicting priorities of stakeholders; (2) helps to construct a ‘unified’ CSR index inclusive of all stakeholders’ views; (3) fosters consensus-driven management decision-making; and thereby (4) facilitates effective CSR stakeholder engagement and implementation. We construct an ‘AHP-based Integrative Framework for Stakeholder Engagement’. We construct a ‘unified’ combined CSR index for Saudi businesses as well as the wider Saudi society as external stakeholders based on 18 CSR indicators identified as relevant through primary data collection. Based on combined rankings for the 18 CSR indicators, the most desirable ‘common’ CSR attributes are determined for all stakeholders. Notably, the popular notion that the Saudis view CSR in terms of philanthropy as a means of fulfiling their charitable obligations is not supported. The ‘AHP-based Integrative Framework for Stakeholder Engagement’ delivers measurable and transparent consensus-driven objective decision-making in setting CSR priorities inclusive of all (internal and external) stakeholders’ views enabling participatory stakeholder engagement and CSR implementation, as well as objective CSR evaluations and comparisons improving the performance-disclosure gap. While this research focuses on CSR, we demonstrate the ‘AHP-based Integrative Framework for Stakeholder Engagement’ serves as a general framework that delivers effective stakeholder engagement in any management decision-making reconciling and integrating various stakeholders’ often conflicting priorities into common objectives thereby enabling organisations the best possible informed management decisions inclusive of all (internal and external) stakeholders views. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP); CSR reporting; multicriteria decision analysis; Saudi Arabia; service sector; Stakeholder conflict resolution","Hierarchical systems; Combined rankings; External stakeholders; Integrative framework; Management decision-making; Management decisions; Primary data; Research focus; Stakeholder engagement; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111682059

We consider a functional organisational structure where a team leader and a project manager are together responsible for the operational execution of a project. The team leader, which has the formal authority over the resources, is standing at the top of the hierarchy and determines the number and mix of (additional) employees and tries to level the workload over the planning period in order to avoid idle resource times. The project manager is responsible for the scheduling of the project activities and his/her objective is to minimise the project duration. The interaction between both agents in the decision-making process is, on the one hand, hierarchical, i.e. the team leader imposes his/her decision on the project manager. On the other hand, the decision taken by the team leader should comply to the objective of the project manager such that the staffing plan and project schedule is agreed by both parties. We propose a bilevel optimisation model that embeds a nested inner optimisation problem, i.e. the project manager decision problem, as a constraint in the outer optimisation problem, i.e. the decision problem of the team leader. The algorithm is a mathematical programming method thriving on the generation of additional lazy constraints via feasibility callbacks so that the team leader problem has to respect the requirements formulated in the project manager problem. In the computational experiments, we compare this solution approach to alternative classical optimisation approaches and we validate the design choices related to the proposed speed-up mechanisms and parameter settings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bilevel optimisation; Multi-agent; Personnel staffing; Project scheduling","Decision making; Managers; Mathematical programming; Multi agent systems; Personnel selection; Bi-level optimization; Decision problems; Multi agent; Optimization problems; Organizational structures; Personnel staffing; Project managers; Project scheduling; Resource Constraint; Team leaders; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108532604

In the conventional RT planning process, the RT planner has to iteratively adjust either the planning objectives (tumour or OAR dose levels) or the weights of the planning objectives until an acceptable plan is obtained that satisfies the minimum requirements. At the end of this iterative process, it remains unknown whether this plan is the best that can be obtained for the patient. The oncologist reviews each plan and decides to either treat using this plan or request further plan development, which may or may not lead to an actual improvement of the reviewed plan. We describe how Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used as a real-time decision support tool to assess quality of RT plans for head and neck cancer patients by applying a knowledge-based comparison of each new plan to a library of previous clinically approved plans. This library allows benchmarking, which gives planners and oncologists a better idea of the relative quality of their plan and its improvement potential, resulting in improved use of resources and better quality treatments for patients. Our DEA-based approach provides a novel way of capturing multiple measures of plan quality as well as anatomical differences between patients in the benchmarking process. We present the developed DEA model and results for a set of benchmark instances.

Therefore, we used a combination of Churchill and Rossiter’s scale development frameworks to create the Ecotourist Identification Scale (EIS) as a tool for identifying ecotourists based on these three criteria. We split a sample of 786 U.S. travellers in half to perform a Principal Components Analysis for scale purification on one half followed by a Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the other.

To deliver such care, providers must respect patients’ needs and preferences and ensure that patients’ values are a centrepiece of clinical decisions. This research proposes a framework for shared decision-making, capable of analytically incorporating patients’ preferences and physicians’ expertise into a joint patient-physician (JPP) model to overcome the barriers encountered in clinical patient-centred care. The JPP framework combines patient’s wishes and physician’s judgments coherently and transparently and generates user-friendly guidance for discussion in a subsequent medical encounter. We examine the impact of integrating patient’s preferences with physician’s expertise for preventive healthcare in the case of choosing an appropriate colorectal cancer screening option. Our results indicate that two possible scenarios might be encountered: (a) the patient-preference-only model and the JPP model do not result in the same screening alternative, and (b) the two models agree in their recommendation. We identify the structural differences in the two models associated with both scenarios. The results show that clinically the proposed JPP model has the capability of providing a transparent starting point for discussions between the patient and the physician. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Analytic Network Process (ANP); joint patient-physician model; patient-centred care; preventive healthcare services; Shared decision-making","Clinical research; Decision making; Diseases; Health care; Clinical decision; Colorectal cancer; Health care providers; Medical decision making; Patient preferences; Shared decision makings; Structural differences; Unified framework; Diagnosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105028580

Current enterprises compact their business software as services into cloud platform to users. In the cloud services market, service providers attempt to make more profits from their services, while users hope to choose low-cost services with high-quality. The conflict of interests between users and service providers is an important challenge for the booming cloud service market. This article characterizes this application problem formally based on a utility game model of service providers and users. In the model, QoS is considered as the basis for determining the utilities of both parties from an economic point of view. By analyzing the behaviors of users and service providers, we introduce the concept of reputation cost for the first time in the model and find a QoS solution that balances the utilities of users and service providers in service transactions. In such a balance, any change in either party's strategy will result in a loss of utility. And then a QoS optimization method is designed to obtain a near-optimal QoS solution for a tradeoff between user satisfaction and provider profit. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to substantiate the effectiveness of our method. The results are applicable to win-win service applications between service providers and users. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Cloud services; game; QoS optimization; user preference; utility","Computer games; Cost benefit analysis; Job analysis; Profitability; Web services; Cloud services; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Game; Optimisations; QoS optimization; Quality-of-service; Task analysis; User's preferences; Utility; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101834397

Nevertheless, our scientific understanding of how individuals work with geospatial information is still limited. While contemporary decision support systems improve geospatial decision-making, managers and researchers must form a more comprehensive understanding of how decision-makers work with geospatial data. For instance, little is known about the prerequisite cognitive abilities required to solve geospatial problems, how to measure such abilities effectively, and the influence of individual characteristics on these abilities. To address this need, we validate the Geospatial Reasoning Ability (GRA) measurement scale on a large sample (N = 794) using a structural equation model (PLS-SEM) analysis. Furthermore, we examine the effects of age, culture, and gender on the model through multigroup (PLS-MGA and permutation) analyses.

With the number keeping on burgeoning, predicting the tendency of services invocation will provide various roles in service ecosystems with promising opportunities. However, services invocation bear three unique characteristics, which give rise to difficulties in predicting them. First, enormous services show different and complicated traits, like periodicity, nonlinearity and nonstationarity. Second, services providing similar or compensatory functions make up intricate relationship. Third, the combination dependencies between mashups and their comprising component services further amplify the difficulty. Given these factors, we have developed a tailored model Multi-Step Piecewise Recurrent Neural Network (MSP-RNN) to predict the tendency of services invocation. In MSP-RNN, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units are used to extract universal features. Based on these features, we have developed a piecewise regressive mechanism to make prediction discriminatingly. Besides, we have developed a multi-step prediction strategy to further enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments in real-world data set with interpretable analysis show that MSP-RNN predicts the tendency of services invocation more accurately, i.e., by 3.7 percent in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), than state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","deep learning; Service discovery; tendency of services invocation; time series prediction","Forecasting; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Baseline methods; Multi-step prediction; Non-stationarities; Number of services; Piece-wise; Prediction accuracy; Real-world; Service ecosystems; Long short-term memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083727261

In this paper we propose SEnD, a fully-distributed censorship circumvention system built upon an overlay, where users have peer-To-peer virtual private IP tunnels to proxies within their social network. With SEnD, users in an uncensored area can act as proxy servers for their social friends in a censored area, allowing them to bypass the censorship. SEnD is able to outperform the current censorship techniques, such as IP address blocking and active probing attacks. We assessed the effectiveness of SEnD through extensive simulations based on a synthetic dataset, as well as experiments based on a prototype implementation. We built our synthetic dataset based on parameters obtained from questionnaires administered both inside and outside China (we consider China as a case study of censorship area). The results show that SEnD is feasible, efficient and scalable. For example, when the proportion of concurrent active users is less than 60, 99.9 percent of these users are able to find proxy servers. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Censorship; communications; distributed system; social network","Communication; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Internet; Peer to peer networks; Servers; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Surveys; Virtual private networks; Active probing; Censorship; Decentralized system; Distributed systems; Extensive simulations; IP networks; Peer-to-peer computing; Prototype implementations; Internet protocols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072735561
