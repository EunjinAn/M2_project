As Industry 4.0 is the relatively new concept originated from an advanced manufacturing vision supported by the German government in 2011, there are only several existing surveys on either cyber physical systems or big data in Industry 4.0. In addition, there are much less surveys related to the intersection between cyber physical systems and big data in Industry 4.0. However, cyber physical systems are closely related to big data in nature. For example, cyber physical systems will continuously generate a large amount of data which requires the big data techniques to process and help to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. Therefore, we conduct this survey to bring more attention to this critical intersection and highlight the future research direction to achieve the fully autonomy in Industry 4.0. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data; cloud computing; cyber-physical systems; data science; industrial information integration engineering; Industry 4.0; IoT","Cloud computing; Cyber Physical System; Distributed computer systems; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Surveys; Advanced manufacturing; data science; Future research directions; German government; Information integration; Resource efficiencies; System scalability; Technology development; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042909694

Counter to this notion, results from six experiments show that lay people adhere more to advice when they think it comes from an algorithm than from a person. People showed this effect, what we call algorithm appreciation, when making numeric estimates about a visual stimulus (Experiment 1A) and forecasts about the popularity of songs and romantic attraction (Experiments 1B and 1C). Yet, researchers predicted the opposite result (Experiment 1D). Algorithm appreciation persisted when advice appeared jointly or separately (Experiment 2). However, algorithm appreciation waned when: people chose between an algorithm's estimate and their own (versus an external advisor's; Experiment 3) and they had expertise in forecasting (Experiment 4). Paradoxically, experienced professionals, who make forecasts on a regular basis, relied less on algorithmic advice than lay people did, which hurt their accuracy. These results shed light on the important question of when people rely on algorithmic advice over advice from people and have implications for the use of “big data” and algorithmic advice it generates. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Accuracy; Advice-taking; Algorithms; Decision-making; Forecasting; Theory of machine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061014799

The proposed model incorporates three acceptance generation stages (primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and outcome stage) and six antecedents (social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and emotion). Utilizing data collected from potential customers, the proposed AIDUA model is tested. Findings suggest that customers go through a three-step acceptance generation process in determining whether to accept the use of AI devices during their service interactions. Findings indicate that social influence and hedonic motivation are positively related to performance expectancy while anthropomorphism is positively related to effort expectancy. Both performance and effort expectancy are significant antecedents of customer emotions, which determines customers’ acceptance of AI device use in service encounters.

The findings of this study, based on articles from the journals included in the Web of Science database, facilitate a broader comprehension of two separate lines of research, which allows an analysis of the interaction among institutions, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. The systematic literature analysis over the last 25 years (1992–2016) of research reveals that institutions could be related to economic growth through entrepreneurship, which would open new research questions about what institutional factors are conducive to entrepreneurship, which in turn spurs economic growth. Thus, not only is understanding both complex relationships and their possible sequence useful for planning strategies and public policies, but it is also helpful for advancing and providing new insights in these research fields, which could be complementary and interdisciplinary. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Economic development; Economic growth; Entrepreneurship; Formal and informal institutions; Institutional approach; Systematic literature analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045282653

Rezaei, Best-worst multi-criteria decision-making method, Omega 53 (2015) 49–57), it has attracted many scholars’ attention due to the efficiency of this method in reducing the times of pairwise comparisons and the good performance in maintaining consistency between judgments. Lots of researches related to this method have been published over the past several years. This paper concentrates on the state-of-the-art survey of the BWM based on the in-depth analysis over the publications concerning this method published from 2015 to 26th, January 2019. This paper intends to answer five questions about the BWM: (1) How does this method perform in bibliometric analysis? (2) Why to propose this method and what is it? (3) Which integrations that the BWM were focused on and which areas did they apply to? (4) What extensions of this method were investigated? (5) What are the challenges and future research directions regarding this method? In view of the fact that the research on this method is still in infancy, this paper has guiding significance for the later research related to the BWM. From the theoretical point of view, the reasonable value of consistency ratio, the inconsistency improving methods, the uncertain extensions of the BWM and the techniques for solving multi-optimality model in the BWM are good research issues that need to be further investigated in the future. From the perspective of application, the software packages for this method, the various integrations of this method, the wider application areas, and the international cooperation on this method are good topics to consider. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Best worst method; Bibliometric analysis; Consistency; Multiple criteria decision making; Pairwise comparisons; Survey","article; decision making; infancy; international cooperation; publication; software; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061718369

The aim of this paper was to identify the main Sustainable Development Goals approached by experts from different geographic regions, according to their experience and research area, and to discuss the relation between these goals and the main local issues and challenges of each region. The methodology starts with snowball sampling to collect information from experts from all geographic regions, through contact networks of universities in different countries. With the information about the goals researched by the participating experts, an analysis of the relation between the study focus and the geographical regions of origin was conducted. A total of 266 specialists from North America, Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania participated in the survey. Based on the sample used, it can be said that there is a relation between the local problems or challenges observed in some regions and the main areas of interest of the surveyed experts, with a general emphasis on the study of goals 4, 11 and 13.

Since then, widespread attention has been devoted to determining when and how this goal will be achieved. This study aims to explore the role of China's changing regional development patterns in the achievement of this goal. This study uses the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) to estimate seven socioeconomic drivers of the changes in CO 2 emissions in China since 2000. The results show that China's carbon emissions have plateaued since 2012 mainly because of energy efficiency gains and structural upgrades (i.e., industrial structure, energy mix and regional structure). Regional structure, measured by provincial economic growth shares, has drastically reduced CO 2 emissions since 2012. The effects of these drivers on emissions changes varied across regions due to their different regional development patterns. Industrial structure and energy mix resulted in emissions growth in some regions, but these two drivers led to emissions reduction at the national level.

The importance of sustainable innovation management in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) cannot be underestimated. Studies on SSCM have emphasised the need for sustainable innovation in achieving sustainability but none provide deep insights into sustainable innovation management in SSCM implementation. This lack of research depth stimulates this study to identify and investigate criteria for sustainable supply chain management innovation advancement. This paper proposes a sustainable innovation criteria framework for investigating sustainable supply chains in manufacturing companies. To exemplify the applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework, a sample of five Indian manufacturing companies are used to evaluate and prioritise the sustainable innovation management criteria, using the ‘best–worst’ multi-criteria decision-making (BW-MCDM) model. The criteria weights for all companies from BWM are aggregated, averaged and used for ranking. The respondent managers viewed ‘financial availability for innovation’ as the most important sustainable innovation sub-criteria. The results of the study will inform industrial managers, practitioners and decision-makers on which criteria to focus on during the implementation stage, to increase sustainability in manufacturing supply chains, and further advance corporate and supply chain sustainable development. The framework may also serve as a theoretical construct for a future empirical study on sustainable supply chain innovation in the manufacturing sector.

As such, the supply and demand are ""endogenously"" dependent on the price the platform charges its customers and the wage the platform pays its independent providers. We present an analytical model with endogenous supply (number of participating agents) and endogenous demand (customer request rate) to study this on-demand service platform. To coordinate endogenous demand with endogenous supply, we include the steady-state waiting time performance based on a queueing model in the customer utility function to characterize the optimal price and wage rates that maximize the profit of the platform. We first analyze a base model that uses a fixed payout ratio (i.e., the ratio of wage over price), and then extend our model to allow the platform to adopt a time-based payout ratio. We find that it is optimal for the platform to charge a higher price when demand increases; however, the optimal price is not necessarily monotonic when the provider capacity or the waiting cost increases. Furthermore, the platform should offer a higher payout ratio as demand increases, capacity decreases or customers become more sensitive to waiting time. We also find that the platform should lower its payout ratio as it grows with the number of providers and customer demand increasing at about the same rate. We use a set of actual data from a large on-demand ride-hailing platform to calibrate our model parameters in numerical experiments to illustrate some of our main insights.

However, not many universities have realised that and many are falling behind. This paper explores the many advantages of the introduction of the SDGs into teaching and suggests that it can catalyse the engagement of students in Higher Education Institutions (HEI) with the concepts of sustainability. The paper fills in a research gap by surveying the current state of the art regarding the theme, presenting current data outlining the extent to which HEI are using SDGs to support their sustainability work. The reasons why some institutions are currently not engaging is also shown. The paper, which consists of a worldwide survey deployed to collect data on the SDGs and sustainability teaching at universities, concludes by providing some recommendations aimed at encouraging further engagement of HEI in incorporatingSDGs as part of their teaching programs. This research is unique in the sense that it provides for the first time offers an overview of the level of emphasis selected universities currently place on the SDGs. Finally, it provides a contribution to current state of knowledge by outlining some actions universities may take, to move forward with their implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Engagement; Higher education; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Teaching","Planning; Surveys; Teaching; Community IS; Current data; Engagement; External stakeholders; Higher education; Higher education institutions; State of the art; Teaching programs; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067272614

The statistical analysis results indicate that security is the most significant antecedent of customers’ trust, followed by platform reputation, mobility and customization. Customers’ trust, in turn, is negatively associated with perceived risk and positively associated with continuance intention. Moreover, a multi-group analysis shows that the relative influences of trust building mechanisms are contingent upon gender.

However, successful adoption and implementation of this paradigm of managing business remains a challenge. In this article, we build a case for utilizing big data analytics (BDA)as a fundamental basis for informed and data driven decision making in supply chain networks supporting CE. We view this from a stakeholder perspective and argue that a collaborative association among all supply chain members can positively affect CE implementation. We propose a model highlighting the facilitating role of big data analytics for achieving shared sustainability goals. The model is based on integrating thematic categories coming out of 10 semi-structured interviews with key position holders in industry. We argue that mutual support and coordination driven by a stakeholder perspective coupled with holistic information processing and sharing along the entire supply chain network can effectively create a basis for achieving the triple bottom line of economic, ecological and social benefits. The proposed model is useful for managers in that it provides a reference point for aligning activities with the circular economy paradigm.

In reality, however, many economies are producing more and more waste, which poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability. The problem is enormously complex as it involves a variety of stakeholders, demands behavioral changes, and requires a complete rethinking of the current waste management systems and the dominant linear economic model. Smart enabling technologies can aid in a transformation of waste management toward a circular economy, but many barriers persist. This study first shortlists twelve important barriers to smart waste management in China based on interviews with experienced practitioners. It then prioritizes these barriers through a scientific prioritization technique, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), based on the survey data from three representative stakeholders. It identified three key causal barriers: the lack of regulatory pressures, the lack of environmental education and culture of environmental protection, and the lack of market pressures and demands.

Organisations need to consider economic, environmental and social sustainability dimensions in their decisions to become sustainable. Supply chain decisions play a distinct and critical role in organisational good and service outputs sustainability. Sustainable supplier selection influences the supply chain sustainability allowing many organisations to build competitive advantage. Within this context, the social sustainability dimension has received relatively minor investigation; with emphasis typically on economic and environmental sustainability. Neglecting social sustainability can have serious repercussions for organisational supply chains. This study proposes a social sustainability attribute decision framework to evaluate and select socially sustainable suppliers. A grey-based multi-criteria decision-support tool composed of the ‘best-worst method’ (BWM) and TODIM (TOmada de Decisão Interativa e Multicritério–in Portuguese ‘Interactive and Multicriteria Decision Making’) is introduced.

A conceptual framework was developed through extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology UTAUT2 by incorporating three additional constructs, namely trust (TR), security (PS) and privacy (PP). Data were collected using an online survey and a self-administrated questionnaire from 901 mobile banking users who were either Lebanese or English. These were analysed using structural equation modelling based on AMOS 23.0. The results of this analysis indicated that behavioural intention towards adoption of mobile banking services was influenced by habit (HB), perceived security (PS), perceived privacy (PP) and trust (TR) for both the Lebanese and English consumers. In addition, performance expectancy (PE) was a significant predictor in Lebanon but not in England; whereas price value (PV) was significant in England but not in Lebanon. Contrary to our expectation, Social Influence (SI) and Hedonic Motivations (HM) were insignificant for both the Lebanese and English consumers. Overall, the proposed model achieved acceptable fit and explained 78% of the variance for the Lebanese sample and 83% for the English sample – both of which are higher than that of the original UTAUT2. These findings are expected to help policy makers and bank directors understand the issues facing mobile banking adoption in different cultural settings. Subsequently, they will help guide them in formulating appropriate strategies to improve the uptake of mobile banking activities. As the low mobile banking adoption rate in Lebanon can be attributed to the novelty of this technology, the Lebanese banking sector stands to greatly benefit from this study. © 2019 The Authors","Culture; Developed countries; Developing countries; Mobile banking; Structural equation modelling; Technology adoption; UTAUT","Cell culture; Developing countries; Developed countries; Mobile bankings; Structural equation modelling; Technology adoption; UTAUT; Surveys; banking; cultural influence; developing world; Internet; mobile phone; security; technology adoption; England; Lebanon; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069599105

Recently, the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique is introduced into service recommendation to pursue high recommendation efficiency and the capability of privacy-preservation, especially when the historical service quality (QoS) data used to make recommendation decisions are distributed across different platforms. However, existing LSH-based service recommendation approaches often face the following challenge: they often assume that the QoS data for service recommendation are static and unique, without considering the influence of dynamic context (e.g., time) on QoS. In view of this challenge, we extend the traditional LSH technique to incorporate the time factor and further propose a novel time-aware and privacy-preserving service recommendation approach based on LSH. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, i.e., WS-DREAM, to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal. The experiment results show that our approach achieves a good tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and efficiency while guaranteeing privacy-preservation. © 2018","Distributed service recommendation; Locality-sensitive hashing; Privacy-preservation; Time","Efficiency; Distributed service; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Locality sensitive hashing; Privacy preservation; Recommendation accuracy; Recommendation efficiency; Service recommendations; Time; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059185548

Nevertheless, there have been difficulties in developing an optimum or even a consensual model able to predict green consumer behaviour. This paper thus seeks to examine the links between a set of constructs in order to propose a model for green consumer behaviour based on a different set of buying behaviour antecedents: a prosocial attitude, the value placed on green and green communication. We developed a survey, in a self-administered questionnaire format, to gather data before applying Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) for the analysis. The results returned convey how general prosocial attitudes have a direct influence on green consumption values, and that green values positively influence green buying behaviour and receptivity to green advertising. However, green advertising generates only a weak influence on green buying behaviours. The relationship between these concepts becomes important whenever considering how best to develop green marketing campaigns and communication strategies able to further nurture green behaviours. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Buying behaviour; Green behaviour; Green communication; Prosocial","Surveys; Buying behaviour; Communication strategy; Green behaviour; Green communications; Individual behaviour; Prosocial; Self-administered questionnaire; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056195065

Thus, forecasting SMEs’ credit risk in SCF has become one of the most critical issues in financing decision-making. Nevertheless, traditional credit risk forecasting models cannot meet the needs of such forecasting. Many researchers argue that machine learning (ML) approaches are good tools. Here we propose an enhanced hybrid ensemble ML approach called RS-MultiBoosting by incorporating two classic ensemble ML approaches, random subspace (RS) and MultiBoosting, to improve the accuracy of forecasting SMEs’ credit risk. The experimental samples, originating from data on forty-six quoted SMEs and seven quoted core enterprises (CEs) in the Chinese securities market between 31 March 2014 and 31 December 2015, are collected to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the RS-MultiBoosting approach. The forecasting result shows that RS-MultiBoosting has good performance in dealing with a small sample size. From the SCF perspective, the results suggest that to enhance SMEs’ financing ability, ‘traditional’ factors, such as the current and quick ratio of SMEs, remain critical. Other SCF-specific factors, for instance, the features of trade goods and the CE's profit margin, play a significant role. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Credit risk forecasting; Machine learning; Partial dependency plot; RS-MultiBoosting; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Supply chain finance","Commerce; Decision making; Finance; Learning systems; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Credit risks; Partial dependency plot; RS-MultiBoosting; Small and medium sized enterprise; Supply chain finances; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061298470

As companies tend to outsource a variety of their activities, green supplier selection as an imperative function of green supply chain management, has a crucial role in helping companies to maintain their strategic competitiveness. Despite the plethora of studies introducing supplier selection models based on economic criteria, studies that take into account the environmental issues are rather limited. In this study, a comprehensive grey-based green supplier selection model is proposed that incorporates both economic and environmental criteria. A novel weight assignment model is proposed by combining best-worst method and fuzzy grey cognitive maps to capture the interdependencies among the criteria. Improved grey relational analysis is advanced to be able to use grey weights of criteria to evaluate green suppliers which are subsequently ranked using an interval analysis approach. This study contributes to the decision-making theory by addressing the shortcomings of the available green supplier selection models.

However, the knowledge about the effects of a manufacturer's design and production capabilities on supply chain quality management is limited. In this study, we propose a model to investigate the effects of mass customization and product modularity on supply chain quality integration (i.e. internal, supplier, and customer quality integration) and the impact of supply chain quality integration on competitive performance. We use data collected from 317 global manufacturers to empirically test the conceptual model. The results show that mass customization and product modularity directly improve internal quality integration, and product modularity also improves internal quality integration indirectly through mass customization. Product modularity improves supplier quality integration directly, and both mass customization and product modularity improve supplier quality integration indirectly through internal quality integration. Mass customization improves customer quality integration both directly and indirectly through internal quality integration, and product modularity improves customer quality integration indirectly through mass customization and internal quality integration. We also find that supplier quality integration directly enhances competitive performance, and internal quality integration enhances competitive performance both directly and indirectly through supplier quality integration. Our findings contribute to production and quality management literature and practices. © 2017","Competitive performance; Mass customization; Product modularity; Supply chain quality integration","Computer aided manufacturing; Manufacture; Quality management; Sales; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Competitive performance; Conceptual model; Customer quality; Internal quality; Mass customization; Product modularity; Production capabilities; Supply chain quality management; Integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038832677

Although textual data are common, it is rarely considered in the financial decision support models. Deep learning uses layers of neural networks to extract features from textual data for prediction. We construct a comprehensive bankruptcy database of 11,827 U.S. public companies and show that deep learning models yield superior prediction performance in forecasting bankruptcy using textual disclosures. When textual data are used in conjunction with traditional accounting-based ratio and market-based variables, deep learning models can further improve the prediction accuracy. We also investigate the effectiveness of two deep learning architectures. Interestingly, our empirical results show that simpler models such as averaging embedding are more effective than convolutional neural networks.

Moreover, when selection criteria are subjective and require decision makers’ judgment, and each candidate supplier dominates a separate selection criterion, the decision-making process becomes more complex and traditional DEA models cannot differentiate between potential candidates. In this paper, we propose a multi-method approach based on quantitative empirical investigations, and analytical modeling. We utilize interval type-2 fuzzy sets to quantify decision makers’ inputs and propose an extended super-efficiency DEA model, which includes both desirable and undesirable inputs and outputs to evaluate suppliers. This approach simultaneously incorporates sustainability and suppliers’ risk factors into the supplier selection problem. The model is developed for both risk-neutral and risk-averse decision-makers. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a real case.

We construct a novel database of CSR contracting and document that CSR contracting has become more prevalent over time. We further find that the adoption of CSR contracting leads to (a) an increase in long-term orientation; (b) an increase in firm value; (c) an increase in social and environmental initiatives; (d) a reduction in emissions; and (e) an increase in green innovations. These findings are consistent with our theoretical arguments predicting that CSR contracting helps direct management's attention to stakeholders that are less salient but financially material to the firm in the long run, thereby enhancing corporate governance. Managerial Summary: This paper examines the effectiveness and implications of integrating environmental and social performance criteria in executive compensation (CSR contracting)—a recent practice in corporate governance that is becoming more and more prevalent. We show that CSR contracting mitigates corporate short-termism and improves business performance. Firms that adopt CSR contracting experience a significant increase in firm value, which foreshadows an increase in long-term operating profits. Furthermore, firms that adopt CSR contracting improve their environmental and social performance, especially with respect to the environment and local communities.

Particularly, decision makers are being increasingly motivated to improve their supply chain activities in coping efficiently with the objectives of sustainable development. Where the era of sustainability threatens the current supply chain partners to either cope with the new regulations of sustainability or leave the field for new players. Notwithstanding, most of the recent studies considered economic and green criteria in handling sustainable supplier selection and order allocation (SSS/OA) problems overlooking the social criteria which represents the third pillar of sustainability. This work aims at putting forward a hybrid Multi Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) approach for a sustainable supplier selection and order allocation problem by considering economic, environmental and social criteria. Thus, an integrated Fuzzy AHP-Fuzzy TOPSIS is proposed to assess and rank suppliers according to three sets of criteria (i.e. conventional, green and social). A Multi-Objective Optimization Model (MOOM) is developed for choosing suppliers and allocating the optimal order quantities. To cope with the multiple uncertainties in the input data, the MOOM is reformulated into a Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization Model. The ε-constraint and LP-metrics approaches are used to reveal two sets of Pareto solutions based on the developed FMOOmodel. Finally, TOPSIS is applied to select the final Pareto solution that is closest to the ideal solution and furthest from the nadir solution. The effectiveness and the applicability of the developed hybrid MCDM-FMOO approach is demonstrated through a case study. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy sets; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization; Supplier selection and order allocation; Sustainability","Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Multiobjective optimization; Social aspects; Supply chains; Current supplies; Ideal solutions; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimal order quantity; Order allocation; Pareto solution; Sustainable supplier selections; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065609782

Three competition scenarios chosen by the manufacturer are studied in this paper. First, the manufacturer does not establish a complete CLSC, and the remanufacturer takes the entire recycling business instead. Second, the manufacturer chooses to establish its own collecting networks, and the manufacturer and remanufacturer compete in the recycling market. Third, the manufacturer chooses to outsource the collecting business to the retailer, and the retailer and remanufacturer compete in the recycling market. We use Stackelberg gaming models to study the optimal pricing strategies for all three individuals and their attitudes toward different scenarios. Finally, numerical analysis is presented. We generate our findings from three aspects, as follows: the manufacturer's recycling choice, supply chain controllability, and influence on retailers and remanufacturers.

We show that female-led ventures are 63 percentage points less likely than male-led ventures to obtain external funding (i.e., venture capital). The most significant portion of the gap (65 percent) stems from gender differences in initial startup orientation, with women being less likely to found ventures that signal growth potential to external investors. However, the residual gap is as much as 35 percent and much of this disparity likely reflects investors’ gendered preferences. Consistent with theories of statistical discrimination, the residual gap diminishes significantly when stronger signals of growth are available to investors for comparable female- and male-led ventures or when focal investors appear to be more sophisticated. Finally, conditional on the reception of external funds (i.e., venture capital), women and men are equally likely to achieve exit outcomes, through IPOs or acquisitions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Discrimination; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Venture capital","Investments; Discrimination; Entrepreneurship; External funding; Gender; Gender differences; Percentage points; Signal growth; Venture Capital; Population statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064820807

Existing literature in analyzing online hotel reviews mainly focuses on a single data resource, lexicon, and analysis method and rarely provides marketing insights and decision-making information to improve business’ service and quality of products. We propose an integrated framework which includes a data crawler, data preprocessing, sentiment-sensitive tree construction, convolution tree kernel classification, aspect extraction and category detection, and visual analytics to gain insights into hotel ratings and reviews. The empirical findings show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms as well as well-known sentiment classification methods, and achieves high precision (0.95) and recall (0.96). The visual analytics results reveal that Business travelers tend to give lower ratings, while Couples tend to give higher ratings. In general, users tend to rate lowest in July and highest in December.

To manage fluctuating demand across market locations (zones), on-demand platforms share market forecasts with workers to inform them where they should be available, and use surge pricing-wherein the price at a particular zone is temporarily raised above the regular price. We analyze these platform strategies in an on-demand marketplace where independent workers can move between adjacent zones, explicitly accounting for the strategic interaction in their moving decisions. We show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, surge pricing can be useful even in zones where supply exceeds demand. Specifically, because workers are strategic agents facing costs to move and competition from other workers who move, simply informing workers where they should be available may not ensure that enough workers move to that zone. Interestingly, more workers can be made to move from a zone with excess supply of workers by strategically using a surge price to throttle demand in that zone. Such strategic surge pricing can increase total platform profit across zones, and even be more profitable than offering workers bonuses to move. Surge pricing in a zone with excess supply can also be useful to credibly communicate the need for more workers to move. In other instances, such surge pricing may be useful to avoid too many workers from moving. Our analysis offers insights for effectively managing on-demand service with independent workers. © 2019 INFORMS.","Demand throttling; Forecast sharing; Gig economy; On-demand economy; Peer-to-peer platforms; Signaling; Spatial pricing; Surge pricing; Worker bonus","Commerce; Forecasting; Profitability; Signaling; Demand throttling; Forecast sharing; Gig economy; On demands; Peer to peer; Worker bonus; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065775413

Subjective judgments can be evaluated by linguistic variables, and both numerical values and subjective judgments can be accurate or uncertain. The evidential reasoning (ER) approach provides a process for dealing with MADM problems of both a quantitative and qualitative nature under uncertainty. The existing ER approach considers both benefit and cost attributes in the evidence combination process. In this paper, deviated interval and fixed interval attributes are introduced into ER based MADM approach and the frames of discernment for representing these two kinds of attributes are given. The transformation rules from the assessment values of deviated interval attributes to belief degrees in the ER structure are then studied. An ave-entropy based weight assignment method considering the risk preference of decision maker is also shown to deal with uncertain assessment situation, such as belief distribution with qualitative attribute and uncertain utility function. Some programming models to generate interval weights and utilities are constructed. The rationality and efficiency of the methods in supporting MADM problems are discussed. Two case studies are provided to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed approaches and the potential in supporting MADM under uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Deviated interval attribute; Entropy; Evidential reasoning; Fixed interval attribute; Multiple attribute decision making; Transformation rule; Weight assignment","Behavioral research; Entropy; Risk assessment; Evidential reasoning; Fixed intervals; Interval attribute; Multiple attribute decision making; Transformation rules; Weight assignment; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053592549

The adaptive distributionally robust optimization framework caters for dynamic decision making, where decisions adapt to the uncertain outcomes as they unfold in stages. For tractability considerations, we focus on a class of second-order conic (SOC) representable ambiguity set, though our results can easily be extended to more general conic representations. We show that the adaptive distributionally robust linear optimization problem can be formulated as a classical robust optimization problem. To obtain a tractable formulation, we approximate the adaptive distributionally robust optimization problem using linear decision rule (LDR) techniques. More interestingly, by incorporating the primary and auxiliary random variables of the lifted ambiguity set in the LDR approximation,we can significantly improve the solutions, and for a class of adaptive distributionally robust optimization problems, exact solutions can also be obtained. Using the new LDR approximation, we can transform the distributionally adaptive robust optimization problem to a classical robust optimization problem with an SOC representable uncertainty set. Finally, to demonstrate the potential for solving management decision problems, we develop an algebraic modeling package and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate modeling and obtain high-quality solutions for medical appointment scheduling and inventory management problems.

Drawing on data from 265 SMEs in the United Kingdom, the main argument of this paper is that variations in formalisation activities reflect differences in firm location, personal networks, the influence of external crisis events, and entrepreneurs’ attitudes towards the prevention of crises. The resulting typology identifies four clusters: Attentive Interventionists, Light Planners, Rooted Strategists and Reliant Neighbours. These findings contrast with prior theorizations of firms as either resilient or vulnerable and further illuminate our understanding of SME resilience and how this is shaped by historical, developmental and strategic factors. The study further develops associations between resilience and social capital, examines how locational choices generate a proximity premium, and develops a growth-survival-maturity perspective on SME resilience. Data reveals an interplay between an ensemble of entrepreneurial activities and decisions about planning, networks, learning, and location.

(2018), which accommodates the presence of a single unknown structural break in the series. The empirical results confirm that the variables are cointegrated in a long-run relationship. Education is negatively linked to energy demand, and export diversification also decreases this demand in the long-run. On the other hand, economic growth increases energy consumption, while oil prices reduce energy demand in the long-run. Natural resource production affects energy consumption positively. Further, the Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM)'s Granger causality analysis reveals a feedback effect between education and energy demand.

The peculiarities of Big Data applications span different fields such as customer need identification, risk management and decision-making, data-driven knowledge, product and service design, quality management, and opportunity recognition and creation. However, while these have resulted in the emergence of a rich research domain focusing on the managerial and practical implications typically addressed from the user perspective, there is still a lack of complete understanding of how companies that provide Big Data solutions can create and capture value from them. This paper explores the question of how provider companies create and capture value from Big Data, drawing on a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies that offer solutions and services based on Big Data. The results illustrate a theoretical framework on value creation and capture by relying on Big Data and identify two main innovation service strategies based on Big Data used by provider companies.

Following the world of practice, research into the adoption, utilization and success of BI systems has grown substantially over the past two decades. The literature suggests that organizations have largely failed to capture the benefits of BI systems to their full extent and are seeking ways to leverage value from the implemented systems. However, prior studies do not have any comprehensive study that discusses the issues and challenges related to adoption, utilization and success of BI systems. In this study, using a systematic literature review, we present comprehensive knowledge about what has been found in the domain of BI system adoption, utilization and success.

Throughout the lean and green debate, many organisations have recognised that LMPs have implications for their sustainable development and competitive positioning. Not only LMPs are complex on their own, but when perceived from an environmental sustainability perspective, the decision to implement an LMP can become even more intricate. Although general tools exist, the lack of effective decision-making tools to help in the implementation of LMPs with an environmental sustainability dimension is palpable. Thus, this study tackles the aforementioned decision problem by incorporating environmental and operational performance outcome expectations as these expectations are viewed in light of the ease of implementation of various LMPs. A novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model for evaluation of LMPs is developed in this respect. The model integrates a three-parameter interval grey number with rough set theory and the TODIM method. The model is run using empirical data from six manufacturing organisations. The findings facilitate the identification of a ‘locus of investments’ for a better selection of LMPs. The robustness of the decision support model developed is assessed through sensitivity analysis. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ease of implementation; environmental performance; grey numbers; lean manufacturing; operational performance; rough set; TODIM","Agile manufacturing systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Environmental management; Lean production; Rough set theory; Sensitivity analysis; ease of implementation; Environmental performance; Grey number; Operational performance; TODIM; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050365776

That consciousness forces companies not only to develop eco-friendly products, but also motivates practitioners and academicians to understand the eco-friendly buying behaviour of the customer. Yet in current literature, there is little discussion available where researchers talk about the influencing relationship of altruistic and egoistic values of customers on their attitudes and purchase intentions towards eco-friendly packaged products. Therefore, this work aims to build a structural model to establish the relationship between egoistic and altruistic values on customers’ attitudes and their intention to purchase products with eco-friendly packaging. With the help of a structured questionnaire, data from 227 young Indian customers was collected. An empirical investigation was carried out and the conceptual model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The analysis indicates that these values do influence purchase intention for products with eco-friendly packaging. However, altruistic value exerts greater influence than egoistic value. This research provides relevant findings about young consumers and their response to products with ecological packaging. These findings will assist marketers in reducing the environmental footprint caused by packaging materials, helping them to retain customers as a result. From the Asian perspective, the present research is among the early efforts towards understanding the significance of values (altruistic and egoistic) pertaining to products with ecological packaging. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Altruistic value; Eco-friendly packaging; Egoistic value; Environmental concern; Health concern","altruism; conceptual framework; consumption behavior; environmental impact; health impact; modeling; numerical model; public attitude",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065708113

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle. The insight will significantly benefit the co-value creation among engineers, project managers, technicians, and senior management team. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","6D; BIM; Carbon; Costs; Digital twin; IS; Level 3 model; Life-cycle; Schedule; Turnout","Architectural design; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Costs; Efficiency; Human resource management; Iodine; Life cycle; Manufacture; Project management; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Scheduling; Sustainable development; Building Information Modelling; Digital twin; Integrated informations; Operation and management; Operational efficiencies; Railway turnout systems; Technical communications; Turnout; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065500423

In recent years, BIM-based construction networks have progressively become the norm in executing BIM activities on projects. However, even though achieving BIM's full capabilities relies on effective collaboration among the team members in BIM-based construction networks, it is still a struggle for these members to collaborate. Nonetheless, only a few studies have been conducted to identify the barriers to strengthening team collaboration in BIM-based construction networks. To address this gap, the current study, by examining 73 journal articles on collaboration in BIM-based construction networks, builds upon a theoretical review of the literature. A conceptual model is presented to capture the main barriers to collaboration in BIM-based construction networks. The study benefits researchers as well as project managers. For researchers, the conceptual model provides an intermediate theory, namely, a theoretical basis to direct further knowledge creation attempts on the topic.

Evaluating the suppliers and selecting the best one based on environmental criteria can facilitate us to reach the objective of green supply chain management. As the assessment generally consists of various alternatives over different criteria, green supplier selection is regarded as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Hesitant fuzzy set, which is an extension of fuzzy set, is an effective tool to handle the vagueness in such a way that hesitant and flawed information by allowing the degree of belongingness for a green supplier selection over the evaluation criteria. In this paper, an integrated method is developed based on Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) approach to solve the multi-criteria decision-making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. This method is based on hesitant fuzzy operators, some improvement in the conventional WASPAS approach and a procedure for calculating the criteria weights. To calculate the criteria and decision expert weights, we propose new information measures for hesitant fuzzy sets and combine entropy and divergence measures for criteria weights, while we use similarity measure for decision expert weights. Since the uncertainty is an inevitable feature of multi-criteria decision-making problems, the developed approach can be a useful tool for uncertain multi-criteria decision-making atmosphere. Next, a green supplier selection problem is taken to show the usefulness of the developed approach in real-life decision-making problems. The results of this study found that the most significant criteria for green supplier selection were management commitment (0.3119), environmental management system (0.2259) and green product (0.2010). Also, we demonstrate a sensitivity analysis over different parameter values and sets of criteria weight to illustrate the stability of the developed method. Finally, the outcome developed approach with existing approaches is compared to validate the developed method. © 2019","Divergence measure; Green supplier selection; Hesitant fuzzy sets; Multi-criteria group decision-making","Environmental management systems; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Sensitivity analysis; Stability criteria; Supply chain management; Decision-making problem; Divergence measures; Green supplier selections; Green supply chain management; Hesitant fuzzy sets; Multi criteria decision making; Multi criteria group decision making; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070228829

Promotion of bioenergy is one of the main aspects of bioeconomy strategy. The aim of this paper is to show how the development of bioenergy can contribute to climate change (and the associated policy). Specifically, we look into the possible reduction of GHG emissions within the framework of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The panel models are estimated for the EU countries by modifying the classical EKC by including in the EKC model biomass and other renewables. The results showed that the coefficient associated with GDP decreases when renewables are included in the model. More specifically, the more types of renewables are included, the lower values of the coefficient associated with the linear term are observed. Furthermore, the effect of biomass on the reduction of GHG emission is higher if opposed to that caused by the other renewable resources. If we hold other factors fixed, increase in biomass use of 1% would reduce GHG emission by 0.089%, whereas the effect of the other renewable energy sources is 0.025%. Therefore, the development of bioeconomy and the promotion of bioenergy are one of the main tools for climate change mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bioeconomy; Bioenergy; Climate change; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable energy","Bioeconomy; Biomass; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Bio-energy; Climate change mitigation; Environmental Kuznets curves; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Political agenda; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable resource; Climate change; alternative energy; bioenergy; climate change; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; air pollution control; Article; bioenergy; biomass; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental Kuznets curve; environmental parameters; environmental policy; European Union; renewable energy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058456181

The SMEs in Indian food sector are facing different challenges, such as financial issues, lack of technical skills and investment in the business etc. In this sense, several key factors can help food SMEs in reducing wastage of farm products and lowering energy consumption for sustainable growth. Thus, this paper tries to identify and analyse key factors for Information Communication Technology (ICT) applications for a sustainable growth of SMEs in Indian food sector. Grey based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique was applied for analysis of factors. From findings, ‘Government initiatives and policies’, ‘Public-private partnership’, and ‘Encouragement to ICT service provider’ are topmost influential cause group factors. While, ‘ICT integrated effective food supply chain’, ‘Coordination between different departments’, and ‘Collaboration and strategic alliances across supply chain’ are highest influenced factors. Results suggests that ‘Government policies and initiatives’ are at the core of the efforts to upgrade food supply chain. As, Indian government is the largest customer of SMEs and controls various policy-making aspects in food sector. Therefore, government has to take steps to encourage private and foreign investments as well as promote IT service providers and business environment related economic policies to improve competitiveness of Indian food sector. This work would help managers to develop efficient ICT applications for an effective sustainable growth of SMEs in their respective food supply chains. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Food supply chain; Grey based; Indian small and medium enterprises; Information communication technology; Resource management; Sustainable growth","Competition; Decision making; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Facings; Food supply; Information management; Investments; Public policy; Service industry; Supply chains; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratories; Grey based; Information communication technology; Resource management; Small and medium enterprise; Sustainable growth; Sustainable development; decision making; food industry; food supply; information and communication technology; resource management; small and medium-sized enterprise; supply chain management; article; catering service; coordination; decision making; food industry; government; human; India; investment; laboratory technique; manager; public-private partnership; resource management; sustainable growth; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064567731

The multistage model allows studying the innovation activities of firms through multi-interrelated factors while controlling the issue of simultaneity and causality. The paper contributes to the research in this area by estimating the effect of innovation on performance through multistage equation modeling. It fills the gap in providing an understanding of factors that influence on product innovation - firm performance relationship in transition economies. This research is among the first to use product-only innovation to measure the impact of innovation on firms' performance. Findings indicate that product innovation has a positive impact on firm performance in transition economies, complemented by significant impact of specific control variables such as size, total labor cost, capital of the firm.

The paper highlights some of the potential relationships between KM in organisations and their economic performance. Finally, the authors assess the role of human resources and technological infrastructures in the relationship between organisation’s approach to KM and their performance. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested via a survey on a sample of managerial-level employees of information technology organisations located in the city of Brno in Czech Republic. The data collected are analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to study the relationship between KM; the workforce’s willingness and ability to collaborate and co-create value; and the organisations’ economic performance. Findings: The research found that there is a direct and positive relationship between an organisation’s approach to KM and its economic performance. This study also shows that the workforce’s behaviour and the technological infrastructure of the organisation have a direct effect on business performance. Finally, the authors proposed that a link between human resource management and technology orientation must be established and supported by a KM strategy. Originality/value: This paper offers a new perspective to the approach to KM in organisations. Reflections and empirical results underline the need for organisations to invest in the implementation of KM strategies that involve both the human resources and technological infrastructure as a way to improve the impact of knowledge on the companies’ economic performances. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Human resources; Information technology; Knowledge management phases; Learning organization; Structural equation modelling; Surveys; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068819354

Therefore, it is quite usual that experts use them to carry out Group Decision Making processes. One disadvantage that recent Group Decision Making methods have is that they do not allow the experts to use free text to express themselves. On the contrary, they force them to follow a specific user–computer communication structure. This is against social network nature where experts are free to express themselves using their preferred text structure. This paper presents a novel model for experts to carry out Group Decision Making processes using free text and alternatives pairwise comparisons. The main advantage of this method is that it is designed to work using social networks. Sentiment analysis procedures are used to analyze free texts and extract the preferences that the experts provide about the alternatives. Also, our method introduces two ways of applying consensus measures over the Group Decision Making process. They can be used to determine if the experts agree among them or if there are different postures. This way, it is possible to promote the debate in those cases where consensus is low. © 2018 The Authors","Consensus measures; Group Decision Making; Sentiment analysis; Social networks","Behavioral research; Concrete pavements; Data mining; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Computer Communications; Consensus measures; Free texts; Group Decision Making; Group decision making process; Pair-wise comparison; Text structure; Two ways; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058180698

The study examines the effect of product certification by expert intermediaries, prominent customers, and social proof (that is, others' interest in investing in a venture) on interest in investing. These three signals are primarily signals of a venture's product, market, and investment characteristics, respectively. The study finds that signals of product certification and prominent customers, and product certification and social proof are complements. In particular, investors who were able to view the combined product certification and prominent customer signals have a 72% higher likelihood of indicating an interest in making an equity investment than those who did not receive any of the three signals. Similarly, investors who were able to view the combined product certification and social proof signals have a 65% higher likelihood of indicating an interest in investing. These results suggest that in the context of technology ventures, a signal about product characteristics is the key to unlocking the value of signals of market or investment characteristics. © 2018 INFORMS.","Entrepreneurial finance; Equity crowdfunding; Equity investments; Randomized field experiment; Signals","Commerce; Sales; Signaling; Equity crowdfunding; Equity investment; Field experiment; Product certification; Product characteristics; Technology ventures; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063404205

The excessive amounts of plastics produced today pose a threat to both man and nature. Urgent approaches towards reducing plastic consumption and increasing its recyclability are needed. This paper discusses the matter of accelerating the circularity of plastic-based material systems. It investigates a sample of plastics-converting companies in Emilia Romagna region (Italy), which stand out for radical innovations in business models, with the aim to catalyse changes in current manufacturing practices. The findings provide empirical support for a positive relationship between business strategies and the use of non-virgin plastic materials. The innovative value of this paper relies on the fact that it elaborates on the vision established within the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy that sets ambitious targets about achieving high plastic recycling targets by 2025. Legislative, economic, technological and social barriers can only be tackled by radically revising the current philosophy of designing, producing, distributing and consuming plastic as part of goods and services. A systemic thinking perspective is an essential building block in this context: moving from a micro to a meso-scale analysis can represent a useful means supporting the creation of viable management approaches towards achieving environmental and economic gains, especially in European plastic conversion industry, where SMEs are the majority (about 50000). Thanks to its analysis and scope, this paper provides useful insights to the plastic industry: it shows that this substantial improvements in this sector will require innovative solutions and major efforts by key decision makers, producers, recyclers, manufacturer, retailers as well as consumers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption; Contamination; Industry; Plastic; Production","Contamination; Decision making; Elastomers; Industrial economics; Industry; Plastic recycling; Production; Building blockes; Business strategy; Consumption; Innovative solutions; Manufacturing practices; Plastic consumption; Radical innovation; Systemic thinking; Plastics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072198787

Traditional recommender systems, however, suffer from data sparsity and cold start problems. To address these issues, a great number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed to leverage side information of users or items (e.g., social network and item category), demonstrating a high degree of effectiveness in improving recommendation performance. This Research Commentary aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on recommender systems with side information. Specifically, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two orthogonal perspectives. One involves the different methodologies of recommendation: the memory-based methods, latent factor, representation learning and deep learning models. The others cover different representations of side information, including structural data (flat, network, and hierarchical features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data (text, image and video features). Finally, we discuss challenges and provide new potential directions in recommendation, along with the conclusion of this survey. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Feature hierarchies; Flat features; Knowledge graphs; Latent factor models; Memory-based methods; Recommender systems; Representation learning; Research commentary; Side information; Social networks","Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Surveys; Feature hierarchies; Flat features; Knowledge graphs; Latent factor models; Representation learning; Side information; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072564292

Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about users’ experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won't easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified. This study explores the feasibility to discover valuable UX data as well as their relations automatically for product design and business strategic plan by analyzing a large volume of customer online data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Design informatics; Information modeling and management; Online review; Opinion mining; Product design; User experience","Data integration; Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Sales; Sentiment analysis; Surveys; Causal dependencies; Informatics; Information Modeling; Online customer reviews; Online reviews; Operational mechanism; User experience; User experiences (ux); Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059121306

We show that the effectiveness of the Simar–Wilson approach critically depends on the assumption that the actual data generating process (DGP) exactly matches their assumed DGP and their approach does not yield correct inferences in environments characterized by stochastic noise. Extensive simulations from a stochastic frontier data generating process document that the simple two-stage DEA + OLS model significantly outperforms the more complex Simar–Wilson model with lower mean absolute deviation (MAD), lower median absolute deviation (MEAD) as well as higher coverage rates when the contextual variables significantly impact productivity.

Results strongly suggest systemic eco-innovation, powered by multidimensional policies, as the key to unlock deep transition. In particular, over the next 20 years Circular Economy development is more than technological and economic puzzle-solving; it will be contingent on the ability to creatively overcome real political trade-offs and broader societal challenges needing to include in their action more social and behavioural considerations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Delphi; Eco-innovation; Policy; Sustainability; Transition","Commerce; Public policy; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Delphi; Eco-innovation; Key characteristics; Operational tools; Sustainability transition; Systematic literature review; Transition; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065494682

While many manufacturing organisations have been taking lean initiatives for the past few years for operational excellence, an impulsive rush to adopt lean without a strategic deployment vision has led to scattered implementation of lean tools and projects without desired success. Many researchers and practitioners prescribe value stream mapping as a foundation for lean transformation initiatives; however, little empirical work is available on the symbiosis of lean and green paradigms to reap maximum benefits. This research, through a systematic methodology and a novel tool called Green Integrated Value Stream Mapping (GIVSM), integrates both paradigms in a case study on a U.K. packaging-manufacturing SME. Applying the GIVSM demonstrates that simultaneous deployment of lean and green paradigms have synergistic effect for improving both operational efficiency and environmental performance. In addition, continuous improvement framework with sustainable procurement is proposed to overcome the lean-green misalignments. This study also provides a guiding reference for practitioners to undertake similar improvement projects and identifies opportunities to expand this academic research on integrated lean-green approach into other industry sectors. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In so doing, performance focused dimensions are imperative in optimizing resources consumption and accomplishing sustainability concepts in an organizational context. In the present study, ‘hard (operational and technology-based) and soft (human resource based)’ performance indicators of the green value chain are analyzed in the Indian agro-based industry context. The performance indicators were identified using literature resource and further analyzed by using a quantitative approach. Several hypotheses were formulated for exploring the interrelationship between the ‘green practices’ and ‘business performance’ in the agro sector. For this work, 490 responses were gathered from a diverse set of respondents. Research findings reveal that ‘Collaborative Green Transportation and Cold storages’ have a higher influence on operational performance. The present research can assist managers, regulating authorities, and decision makers in understanding the linkage between the green-focused - operational and human resource related factors and business operational performance in agro food supply context. Based on the findings, the decision makers need to develop policies for improving the overall efficiency of the case sector. Researchers can carry out investigations by applying various multi-attribute decision making tools and formulating hypothesis, which can be further tested by statistical tools across various industries and in different economies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-food supply chain; Corporate social responsibility; Green human resource management; India; Performance indicators; Sustainability","Benchmarking; Cold storage; Decision making; Food supply; Social aspects; Statistical mechanics; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Transportation personnel; Agri-food supply chains; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); India; Multi attribute decision making; Operational performance; Organizational context; Performance indicators; Regulating authorities; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060954277

Cement is primarily used in concrete, the most used material on the planet and a critical part of any analysis of emissions reduction strategy. To estimate the potential for reducing demand, this work analyses material flow in the cement industry, using the UK in 2014 as a case study. Combining published data, analytic assumptions, and interviews we estimated the material flow of cement from the production to a breakdown of its use in applications. Having broken down the demand for cement into 25 applications, multiple material efficiency techniques were considered: substituting cement for calcined clay and limestone, reducing the cement content of concrete, post-tensioning floor slabs, using more precast building elements, reducing construction waste, and reducing the overdesign in construction. We produce a final estimate of the total reduction in emissions achievable from material efficiency: 51.3%. Due to overlap and interactions between the methods, the attribution of the carbon abatement depends on the sequence of application. In this analysis, we have applied the reduction of overdesign last, because it is independent of the others, and would require a cultural change. We show then that cement demand from floors, repairs and maintenance, concrete beams, and applications within the transport sector should be targeted. The substitution of cement with calcined clay and limestone has the biggest potential to reduce cement demand (27%) and carbon emissions in the UK. Reducing the amount of cement in concrete has the next highest potential (10%), followed by post-tensioning floor slabs (3%). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Cement; Material efficiency; Material flows","Calcination; Carbon; Cements; Concretes; Efficiency; Emission control; Floors; Lime; Limestone; Building element; Carbon emissions; Construction wastes; Emissions reduction; Material efficiency; Material Flow; Multiple materials; Transport sectors; Cement industry; cement; concrete; limestone; assessment method; carbon emission; cement (construction material); demand analysis; material flow analysis; agriculture; Article; building; building industry; carbon footprint; case study; cement industry; commercial phenomena; content analysis; flow measurement; industrialization; information processing; limit of quantitation; productivity; reduction (chemistry); substitution reaction; uncertainty; United Kingdom; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056621341

Farmer credit risk evaluation is an important issue when determining financial support to farmers, improving agricultural supply chain performance, and ensuring profitability of financial institutions. Credit risk evaluation, or creditworthiness, is not a trivial exercise due to various complexities. Honoring complexity is necessary to effectively evaluate and predict farmer creditworthiness. A methodology using fuzzy rough-set theory and fuzzy C-means clustering is used to evaluate and investigate the complex relationships between farmer characteristics, competitive environmental factors, and farmer credit level. The methodology is detailed using actual bank data from 2044 farmers within China. This empirical methodology generates decision rules that provide insight to more complex relationships than can be found through standard econometric multivariate approaches. A rule-based methodological outcome can be used to predict the creditworthiness of farmers and to aid in agricultural loan decision making. Prediction accuracy of the rule-base was 81.16%. A central finding is that education and skills related characteristics are important for determining farmer credit-worthiness.

Recent practices and literature however undermines many suggested benefits of BSS showing they mostly facilitate transport for already privileged demographics in increasingly exclusive urban cores. Additionally, case study performance estimates in Europe and North America commonly show low usage rates further undermining promoted benefits. In the context of urban transports existing social injustice, energy consumption and land use, which cannot be sustained, this work, drawing on data analysis, interviews and literature and media review in North America and Europe, presents how existing BSS deployments have intrinsic flaws. These convenient luxuries are typically not effective or less so than familiar, proven and less technologically innovative opportunities at achieving greater cycling modal share. This paper illustrates how with BSS deployments converge many actors, promoting success and beneficial narratives, gain advantage through diverse outcomes while residents subsidize the services economically, through public land or advertising, while receiving few benefits. Municipalities and decision makers regularly use BSS to promote themselves, their city, attract investment and develop local pride in representatives and their policy. Beyond being a good example of policy boosterism and rich in rhetoric, BSS often have less effective or just outcomes than alternative transport policies. Advertisers meanwhile utilize sustainability narratives to capitalize on new markets and commodification opportunities while effectively undermining promoted BSS outcomes. This paper provides a critical history of BSS, summarizes their stated purposes and benefits and utilizes a smart-city critique framework to evaluate outcomes. This work concludes that most BSS typically benefit the privileged, help little to increase mass cycling transport and are used as easily deployable technological (false) solutions to contemporary problems while advancing unjust tendencies to privatize public space and services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Decision making; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Investments; Land use; Sustainable development; Bicycle sharing; Decision makers; Public lands; Public space; Social benefits; Technology providers; Transport policy; Urban transport; Urban transportation; cycle transport; decision making; demography; public transport; smart city; sustainability; urban transport; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061131884

However, only a limited amount of literature assesses the effect of culture, socio-economic, historical, and regulatory factors on the classification of factors that are important to individual preferences for resource development used in designing valid discrete choice experiments. This work seeks to assess differences in the levels of importance among the determinants of public acceptance of mining projects due to differences in cultural, regulatory, socio-economic, and historical contexts. This will be accomplished by comparing the levels of importance as reported by respondents in the United States, China and Turkey. We used the same survey in the three countries to: (1) validate in China and Turkey the classification of mining project characteristics identified by previous research in the United States; (2) verify the key demographic factors that can be used to explain individual preferences relating to project characteristics in China and Turkey; and (3) compare the differences between attitudes of respondents from mining communities in the United States, China and Turkey. The median ranking of all 16 project characteristics was higher than the midpoint ranking (neither important nor unimportant), verifying that this classification of factors were valid in the three countries.

To this end, we first explain how the big data analytics cycle can provide useful insights into the characteristics of the environments in which many organizations operate. Next, we review some common challenges faced by many organizations in their uses of big data analytics and offer specific recommendations for mitigating them. Among these recommendations, which are rooted in the findings of strategy implementation research, we emphasize managerial responsibilities in providing continued commitment and support, the effective communication and coordination of efforts, and the development of big data knowledge and expertise.

The two schemes differ on the payment mechanism: under the fee-for-service scheme, the healthcare provider receives the payment each time a patient visits (or revisits) whereas, under the bundled payment scheme, the healthcare provider receives a lump sum payment for the entire episode of care regardless of how many revisits a patient incurs. By considering the quality-speed trade-off (i.e., a higher service speed reduces service quality, resulting in a higher revisit rate), we examine a three-stage Stackelberg game to determine the patients’ initial visit rate, the service provider’s service rate (which affects the revisit rate), and the funder’s reimbursement rate. This analysis enables us to compare the equilibrium outcomes (social welfare, revisit rate, and waiting time) associated with the two payment schemes. We find that when the patient pool size is large, the bundled payment scheme dominates the fee-for-service scheme in terms of higher social welfare and a lower revisit rate, whereas the fee-for-service scheme prevails in terms of shorter waiting time. When the patient pool is small, the bundle payment scheme dominates the fee-for-service scheme in all three performance measures. © 2018 INFORMS","Bundled payment; Fee-for-service; Healthcare operations; Queueing","Economic and social effects; Bundled payment; Fee-for-service; Health care providers; Health-care operations; Patient waiting time; Performance measure; Public healthcares; Queueing; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065647042

We propose and evaluate the value-creation mechanisms of network resources from different types of partners for startups, highlighting the unique resources of government partners for cleantech startups.

Our findings highlight the importance of governmental partners in technology development alliances to catalyze cleantech startup innovation (the patenting activity of cleantech startups increases by 73.7 percent with every additional governmental technology alliance when compared to those startups that did not engage in such alliances) and as quality signals to private sector investors for licensing alliances (private financing deals increase by 155 percent for every additional license from a government organization).

Prior research investigating the performance consequences of strategic IT alignment (SITA) has produced inconsistent results. This paper distinguishes between two roles of SITA: (1) as a state of congruence between business and IT, which is the primary focus of empirical studies, and (2) as reflecting a capability that may enable or inhibit the leveraging of IT investments, as has been discussed theoretically but not examined empirically. Based on the resource-based view (RBV), IT investment (ITI) is explicitly included as the resource that SITA as a capability can inherently help leverage. Also based on RBV, we argue that environmental uncertainty, which is examined in terms of dynamism, complexity, and munificence, moderates the effect of SITA on the relationship between ITI and firm performance. The research model is tested through panel-data analyses of data from 1999–2008, including 758 firm-year observations from 242 firms. This study is the first to find that SITA as a state directly improves firm performance even when considering ITI and its interaction with SITA. Moreover, the effect of the interaction between SITA and ITI on firm performance increases with an increase in environmental dynamism or complexity and with a decrease in environmental munificence. We also find that the effect of the interaction between SITA and ITI can be negative under some environments. Specifically, the results suggest that (1) in dynamic, complex, and hostile environments, SITA does reflect a capability that enhances the positive effect of ITI on firm performance, but (2) in stable, simple, and munificent environments, SITA reflects a rigidity that reduces the positive effect of ITI on firm performance. The results are robust under a variety of statistical specifications and estimations. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

This opaqueness tends to generate resistance when SOEs undertake cross-border acquisitions. Opaqueness can also aggravate concerns about an SOE's semipolitical nature and its susceptibility to agency problems, making gaining legitimacy harder. Data on attempted foreign acquisitions by Chinese firms were analyzed to compare the likelihood of deal completion between SOEs and firms with other forms of ownership. The SOEs' completion rate was 14% lower than that of other firms. Their disadvantage was shown to be alleviated when they could provide credible signals by being publicly listed (though only on an exchange in a well-developed economy or by hiring reputable auditors). We also find that the disadvantage of SOEs was partially mediated by their opaqueness. Managerial Summary: Opaqueness, or lack of transparency, is critical in many business transactions. In this article, we argue that the concept of opaqueness can help us understand why SOEs tend to have a lower likelihood of deal completion in cross-border acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that opaqueness influences the relationship between state ownership and deal completion, and firms can improve their chance of success in cross-border acquisitions by providing credible information, such as by listing on an exchange in a developed market or hiring a reputable auditor. These help mitigate the hazard of opaqueness. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","acquisitions; China; emerging economies; opaqueness; state-owned enterprises","Mergers and acquisitions; Planning; Business transaction; China; Cross-border acquisitions; Emerging economies; Foreign acquisitions; International acquisitions; opaqueness; State owned enterprise; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058845988

In order to advance this area of research and to help further incorporate sustainability into 3PRLPs selection modeling, a novel multi-stage, multi-method, multi-criteria approach is developed. Methodologically, this is the first time that neighborhood rough set (NRS) theory is integrated with TOPSIS and VIKOR techniques. Neighborhood rough set, as a data management and soft computation tool, can help reduce the number of 3PRLP to be evaluated and ranked using TOPSIS combined with VIKOR's compromise conception decision tools. A conceptual application is developed using business, environmental, and social factors within the context of reverse logistics management decisions. A sensitivity analysis evaluating various neighborhood rough set parameters is also introduced to investigate robustness of solutions using the multi-stage methodology.

The result is not significantly consistent with EKC hypotheses. The effect of export on air pollutant emissions presented an “inverse-U″ or “increasing linear” shape in eastern China, an “increasing linear” or “inverse-N″ shape in central China, and an “inverse-U″ shape in western China; the export had a promoting effect on air pollutants, which indicates air pollutants transferred into China.

While problem-focused coping (PFC) has been extensively studied in the IT security literature, little is known about emotion-focused coping (EFC). We propose that individuals employ both PFC and EFC to volitionally cope with IT security threats, and conceptually classify EFC into two categories: inward and outward. Our research model is tested by two studies: an experiment with 140 individuals and a survey of 934 respondents. Our results indicate that both inward EFC and outward EFC are stimulated by perceived threat, but that only inward EFC is reduced by perceived avoidability. Interestingly, inward EFC and outward EFC are found to have opposite effects on PFC. While inward EFC impedes PFC, outward EFC facilitates PFC. By integrating both EFC and PFC in a single model, we provide a more complete understanding of individual behavior under IT security threats. Moreover, by theorizing two categories of EFC and showing their opposing effects on users’ security behaviors, we further examine the paradoxical relationship between EFC and PFC, thus making an important contribution to IT security research and practice. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

Product management greatly influences supply chain performance. Supply chain information is also critical for sound product management. Product deletion, rationalization, or discontinuation research is an important dimension often overlooked in product management. It is a critical issue for many managerial reasons, many espoused in this article. Product deletion is typically a multi-staged process including recognition, analysis and revitalization, evaluation and decision formation, and implementation. Each stage requires complicated information and data support from supply chain activities. Failure in information generating, understanding, and accuracy can prove risky for rational product deletion. Blockchain technology may help address information challenges. Blockchain technology provides traceability, transparency, security, accuracy, and smart execution, which can all contribute to the product deletion and rationalization decision. Application recommendations and managerial insights into product deletion decision making processes with blockchain technology are provided. © 1973-2011 IEEE.","blockchain technology; information systems; Product deletion; supply chain management","Blockchain; Decision making; Information management; Information systems; Managers; Address informations; Application recommendations; Critical issues; Decision making process; Product deletion; Product management; Supply chain flows; Supply chain performance; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061528564

It has been widely proved that fiscal decentralization is of great use to economic growth, but its environmental effect is still inconclusive. As the complex mechanism for the impact of fiscal decentralization on environment still remains unclear, our study is making an attempt to bridge the gap by introducing a detailed theoretical analysis by making use of a utility maximization approach, and two kinds of fiscal decentralization concerning both revenue and expenditure decentralization are analyzed; besides, an empirical test is further made on their effects on environmental quality and two types of regulations (that is, fiscal environmental input and environmental administrative charge). According to the results of the theoretical analysis, both of the decentralizations have positive effects on environmental improvement. The results of the empirical tests based on the panel data of 30 provinces/municipalities confirm the above theoretical deductions, as well as the following conclusions could also be derived. First of all, the fiscal decentralization has a positive regulatory effect on the environmental regulations mentioned above, which indicates there is synergy between the two kinds of policy tools. Secondly, the empirical results determine a threshold effect of fiscal decentralization on environment. Lastly, compared with expenditure decentralization, the fiscal revenue decentralization proves to be more effective for environmental improvement. Based on these conclusions, it is recommended that the central government should strengthen both environmental management and fiscal decentralization systems so as to achieve a win-win situation for economic growth and environmental protection. Particularly, in order to maximize its potential, we propose that priority be given to fiscal revenue decentralization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Empirical test; Environmental effect; Fiscal decentralization; Regulatory effect; Theoretical analysis","Developing countries; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Quality control; Central government; Empirical test; Environmental improvements; Environmental quality; Fiscal decentralization; Regulatory effects; Theoretical analysis; Utility maximizations; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071025201

This paper provides a novel contribution to the field by examining the factors related to willingness of potential Chinese consumers to further adopt EVs. Much of the research to date has focused primarily on consumer perceptions in European countries, or within particular cities or urban provinces of China. Given that China also is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, and that transportation is growing in its contribution to China's national carbon footprint, the potential for larger scale uptake of EVs by Chinese consumers is an important area of research. We therefore utilize a survey instrument among a fairly large national sample (805 respondents across all Chinese provinces) to solicit perceptions of Chinese consumers about their willingness to adopt EVs, and the importance of different types of motivations, controlling for socio-demographic variables. Using descriptive statistics as well as multivariate analysis and principal component analysis, we find that willingness to adopt EVs is associated with performance features of electric vehicles, the perceived benefits of driving an electric vehicle and policy support for the promotion of electric vehicles. We conclude by elaborating on the implications of our findings, namely insights for car dealerships and sales personnel, automotive manufacturers, local and national planners, and users and adopters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonizing transport; Electric mobility; Electric vehicles; Pro-environmental behavior; Purchasing intentions","Automobile manufacture; Carbon footprint; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Multivariant analysis; Sales; Surveys; Automotive manufacturers; Decarbonizing transport; Descriptive statistics; Electric mobility; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Multi variate analysis; Pro-environmental behaviors; Socio-demographic variables; Electric bikes; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; perception; surveying; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062937851

The economics literature theorizes regarding optimal usage of Heckman's method, emphasizing the valid exclusion condition necessary in the first stage. However, our meta-analysis reveals that only 54 of 165 relevant papers published in the top strategy and organizational theory journals during 1995–2016 claim a valid exclusion restriction. Without this condition being met, our simulation shows that results using the Heckman method are often less reliable than OLS results. Even where Heckman is not possible, we recommend that other rigorous identification approaches be used. We illustrate our recommendation to use a triangulation of identification approaches by revisiting the classic global strategy question of the performance implications of cross-border market entry through greenfield or acquisition. Managerial Summary: Managers make strategic decisions by choosing the best option given the particular circumstances of their firm. However, researchers had previously not taken into consideration these circumstances when evaluating the outcome of that choice. The Heckman method importantly addresses this situation, but requires that the researcher have some variable that effects the best option for the firm, but not the outcome. We show that researchers frequently do not utilize such a variable, and demonstrate that the Heckman method can exacerbate estimation issues in this case. We then provide an approach that researchers can use to address the challenge of determining the outcome of a strategic decision, and illustrate it with an empirical examination of the performance implications of cross-border market entry through greenfield or acquisition. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","entry mode; foreign investment; Heckman correction; selection bias; two-step estimator","Commerce; Managers; Empirical examination; Entry mode; Foreign investment; Identification approach; Organizational theory; Selection bias; Strategic decisions; two-step estimator; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061265154

One of the challenges of omni-channel retailing and supply chain management is a result of the new and complex characteristics of the omni-channel retail environment; specifically, how to make customers more familiar with and adapt themselves to the omni-channel retail setting and to get them to utilize it to their advantage. Understanding customer perception is the first step in overcoming that challenge. This study examines the influential factors of customer channel selection intention in an omni-channel retail setting. Via an empirical analysis through surveys of customers (among whom a majority are online buyers) from the United States and United Kingdom, we find that channel transparency, channel convenience, and channel uniformity positively influence customer perceived behavioral control. In addition, we find that channel transparency and uniformity help reduce customers’ perceived risk, whereas channel convenience does not have a significant impact. Higher product price increases the influence of channel transparency, convenience, and uniformity on reducing customers’ perceived risk. Furthermore, we find customer perceived behavioral control and channel price advantage have a positive impact, and perceived risk has a negative impact on customer channel selection intention in the omni-channel retail environment. Our study provides an opportunity for omni-channel retailers to understand customer perception and needs, and better improve their offerings and supply chain management to attract more customer demand. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Channel convenience; Channel selection intention; Channel transparency; Channel uniformity; Omni-channel retailing; Omni-channel supply chain management","Supply chain management; Transparency; Channel convenience; Channel selection; Channel uniformity; Complex characteristics; Customer perceptions; Influential factors; Omni-channel retailing; Perceived behavioral control; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060011137

In industry, soft (human resource-related) dimensions influence the implementation of GSCM process greatly. In the literature, relatively less discussion is provided on assessing the significance of soft dimensions in efficient GSCM acceptance in industry. The present work is an attempt to construct a structural framework for assessing the significance of the soft dimensions in adopting GSCM concepts by taking a case of automotive company in India.

BWM is used to prioritize the GSCM oriented soft dimensions, and DEMATEL is employed to extract interrelationships among them. The result shows that ‘Top management commitment’, ‘Employee involvement’, ‘Organizational culture’ and ‘Teamwork’ are the highly prioritized causal soft dimensions in efficient GSCM adoption.

We find that early investors with experience—particularly investors with app development experience and investors with app investment experience—have a disproportionate influence on later investors in the crowd. Investors with app development experience are likely to have better knowledge of the product and are therefore found to be more influential for “concept apps” (apps in the pre-release stage), while investors with app investment experience with a better knowledge of market performance are found to be more influential for “live apps” (apps that are already being sold in the market). Our findings show that the majority of investors in this market, the crowd, although inexperienced, are rather sophisticated in their ability to identify and exploit nüanced differences in the underlying expertise of the early investors, informational signals that align well with the informational needs they face in the different stages of a venture. In examining the ex post performance of apps, we find that apps with investments from investors with experience are positively associated with ex post app sales. More importantly, we find that investors with experience indeed have the ability to select better apps, making their investment choices credible signals of quality for the crowd. Contrary to popular perceptions of crowdfunding platforms as substitutes for traditional expert-dominated mechanisms, our findings indicate that participation by individuals with experience can be beneficial to these markets. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

The deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (bio-CCS) could significantly reduce their emission intensities. In detail, the results demonstrate that CO 2 emission reduction targets of up to 20% can be met entirely by biomass deployment. A slow CCS technology introduction on top of biomass deployment is expected, as the requirement for emission reduction increases further. Bio-CCS could then be a key technology, particularly in terms of meeting targets above 50%, with CO 2 avoidance costs ranging between €60 and €100 t CO2 −1 at full-scale deployment. The future of bio-CCS and its utilisation on a larger scale would therefore only be viable if such CO 2 avoidance cost were to become economically appealing. Small and medium plants in particular, would economically benefit from sharing CO 2 pipeline networks. CO 2 transport, however, makes a relatively small contribution to the total CO 2 avoidance cost. In the future, the role of bio-CCS in the European iron and steelmaking industry will also be influenced by non-economic conditions, such as regulations, public acceptance, realistic CO 2 storage capacity, and the progress of other mitigation technologies. © 2019 The Authors","BECCS; Bio-CCS; Blast furnace; CCS; Charcoal; Industry","Biomass; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Charcoal; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Industrial economics; Industry; Iron; Steelmaking; BECCS; Bio-CCS; CO2 emission reduction; Economic condition; Emission intensity; Emission reduction; Public acceptance; Steel-making industries; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061317532

Although technostress is a highly prevalent organizational phenomenon, there is a lack of theory-based understanding on how IT users can cope with it. We theorize and validate a model for deliberate proactive and instinctive reactive coping for technostress. Drawing from theories on coping, our model posits that the reactive coping behaviors of distress venting and distancing from IT can alleviate technostress by diminishing the negative effect of technostress creators on IT-enabled productivity.

Hence new forms of organisation are needed. Collaborating with Building Information Modelling (BIM) is complex and challenges the management of projects. The ubiquitous digital information sharing among multi-disciplinary actors in BIM-based projects, activates dense inter-organisational processes. This study offers insights into collaboration with BIM, through the theoretical lens of boundaries. By analysing two projects of BIM-based collaboration in the Netherlands, the interplay between structure and agency of collaboration was discussed. The various artefacts of BIM, as boundary objects were interpreted in multiple ways by different communities of practice and this resulted in poor communication and consequently poor collaboration. The findings challenge the prevalent view of BIM as a software artefact and showed that this view only partially supports collaboration. Additionally, a structurational view (enabled by communication, conflict management, negotiation, and teamwork) as opposed to a structural view of collaboration (e.g. BIM as a software) can fully support the implementation of digital innovations. Finally, the paper revealed a ‘tactical gap’ in the implementation of digital between strategic and operational decision-making needs fine-tuning to ensure better collaboration in projects where digital innovations are adopted. The study concludes with propositions for supporting organisation of teams through integration of activities and the management of BIM-based collaboration in projects beyond merely structural and technological approaches, which dominate the field but from a structurational view instead. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association","Boundary theory; Building Information Modelling (BIM); Collaboration; Digital; Structuration","Construction industry; Decision making; Human resource management; Information theory; Boundary theories; Building Information Modelling; Collaboration; Digital; Structuration; Architectural design; construction industry; decision making; innovation; modeling; organizational framework; theoretical study; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061406205

While economists have tended to focus on high-growth, high-tech startup firms as the unit of analysis, economic geographers and urbanists have examined the geographic dimensions of entrepreneurship, particularly the rise of entrepreneurial clusters and eco systems. We focus here on a particular type of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship associated with high-tech startup companies, or what we refer to as “tech-startup entrepreneurship.” We contend that the organization of such Schumpeterian entrepreneurship occurs at two spatial scales. At the macro-geographic level, it is highly clustered and concentrated in a relatively small number of global cities or metro areas. At the micro-geographic level, it is highly concentrated in distinct districts or micro-clusters within these leading cities and metro areas. To examine the geographic dimensions of tech-startup entrepreneurship across these spatial scales, we use previously unused data on venture capital-financed startups at the metropolitan and district levels. Our findings support the hypothesis that tech-startup entrepreneurship is organized across two distinct but related spatial scales, which act on entrepreneurial activity through different mechanisms. These findings suggest that local diversity and local specialization can simultaneously potentiate innovation, and that a multi-scalar approach to the geography of entrepreneurship is prudent. © 2018","City; Clustering; Geography; Startup entrepreneurship; Tech startups; Venture capital","economic activity; economic growth; economic theory; entrepreneur; high technology industry; hypothesis testing; industrial location; innovation; organizational framework; technological development; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059638509

This paper aims to investigate how different PSS archetypes may affect firms’ sustainability performance differently, and to identify the main reasons for the differences. We studied three manufacturing firms, each of which has co-existence of various archetypes of PSS. We analysed the sustainable value generated by each archetype, and observed that, firstly, different archetypes of PSS do create differences in the sustainable value delivered; secondly, the main reason for the difference is the integration level of product maker, owner and user; thirdly, result-oriented PSS is shown to have significant potential to deliver environmental and economic benefits through enhanced resource efficiency in production and consumption; and fourthly, PSS alone does not have significant social sustainability effects. We then proposed a framework of PSS business model archetypes and sustainability based on the literature study and empirical evidence. The proposed framework is novel and provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic, environmental and social sustainable value creation of known PSS business model archetypes. The findings can be applied in manufacturing firms to explore sustainable value sources when developing different archetypes of PSS business models. © 2019","Product-service system; PSS; PSS archetypes; Servitization; Sustainable business models; Sustainable value","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Product-service systems; PSS archetypes; Servitization; Sustainable business; Sustainable values; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062686637

Impressions generated through earned social media complement owned media, but not paid media.

However, although their adoption is well documented in developed nations and few other countries, very little has been done to understand such phenomenon in a rapid developing country such as Thailand. This paper aims at filling this gap by providing light into some fundamental issues regarding the implementation of these approaches in the manufacturing sector of Thailand. A survey-based exploratory research was carried out based on 287 Thai manufacturing companies. The data was analysed using a combination of descriptive and inferential statics. The study revealed that a large amount of investment capacity, and proper training & knowledge are needed to fully implement the studied operational approaches. This resulted in some of the weakest elements of Thai manufacturing firms and hence the main barriers to their implementation. The study also showed that Thai manufacturing firms consider the impact on the environment and benefits from adopting these operational approaches as company's policy and own initiative, environmental awareness, and cost saving from conservation of energy as the main reasons for adopting the studied operational approaches. Finally, the findings also indicate that Thai manufacturing firms tend to implement them because of internal factors and that they lack of motivation from external factors and involvement from other stakeholders. The paper extends the current limited knowledge on the deployment of operational environmental sustainability approaches in Asia, and its results can be beneficial for organisations that aim at effectively adopting them to improve their operation's sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental sustainability; Implementation; Manufacturing; Operations improvement","Developing countries; Economics; Industrial research; Investments; Logistics; Manufacture; Pollution control; Supply chain management; Environmental awareness; Environmental challenges; Environmental sustainability; Green supply chain management; Impact on the environment; Implementation; Manufacturing companies; Operations improvement; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062692494

This study utilizes 222 cases from 18 of Ghana's key stakeholders and finds that the membership of country's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and petroleum revenue management policies are insufficient to avert its ‘resource-curse’ unless they are complemented with country-level institutional factors such as the quality of institutions, quality of governance, government effectiveness, accountability, corruption control mechanisms, natural resource sustainability and effective accounting practices. Consequently, the study contributes to the deeper understanding of complex macro-level factors interlinked with the ‘natural resource-curse’. We also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, along with suggestions for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Institutional quality; Resource-curse; Sustainability; Transparency","Developing countries; Economics; Sustainable development; Transparency; Accountability; Accounting practices; Institutional factors; Institutional qualities; Natural resource curse; Non-governmental organisations; Resource curse; Resource sustainability; Economic and social effects; accountability; developing world; economic development; economic growth; energy resource; nongovernmental organization; stakeholder; sustainability; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044312006

Two decades ago, a new global standard of intellectual property swept across developing and industrialized nations through the implementation of the WTO's TRIPS Agreement. Many years later, the issue of patent rights remains contentious. In this paper, we focus on the effects of patent rights systems on total factor productivity growth, using dynamic panel regression analysis for 70 countries from 1965 to 2009. We show that the effects of stronger or more rigorous patent systems are insignificant for productivity growth in both developing and industrialized countries. Why does the strength of patents appear to have no impact on productivity? Classic economic theory suggests that stronger patent systems incentive innovative output with important spill-over effects for productivity and growth. We offer an alternative explanation using data from the Economic Complexity Index. We find that while patents rights are increasingly irrelevant to productivity, the relationship between economic complexity and productivity is highly positive and significant. Our results are consistent with the contributions of the absorptive capacity theory in that they suggest it is not the discovery and ownership of novel products and processes at the innovative frontier that induces productive growth, but the ability to adapt, replicate and diffuse along the international productive chain. © 2018","Development; Economic complexity; Innovation; Intellectual property rights; Patents; Productivity","complexity; developing world; economic analysis; economic development; innovation; intellectual property rights; policy analysis; policy implementation; theoretical study; total factor productivity; World Trade Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057145301

In order for battery swap to be economically sound, the BSS operator must make a long-term decision on the number of charging bays in the facility, a medium-term decision on the number of batteries in the system, and short-term decisions on when and how many batteries to recharge. In this paper, we introduce a periodic fluid model to describe charging operations at a BSS facing time-varying demand for battery swap and time-varying prices for charging empty batteries, with the objective of finding an optimal battery purchasing and charging policy that best trades off battery investment cost and operating cost including charging cost and cost of customer waiting. We consider a two-stage optimization problem: An optimal amount of battery fluid is identified in the first stage. In the second stage, an optimal charging rule is determined by solving a continuous-time optimal control problem. We characterize the optimal charging policy via Pontryagin's maximum principle and derive an explicit upper bound for the optimal amount of battery fluid which allows us to quantify the joint effect of demand patterns and electricity prices on battery investment decisions. In particular, fewer batteries are needed when the peaks and the troughs of these periodic functions occur at different times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Battery swapping and charging; Dynamic fluid model; Electric vehicles; Production and inventory control; Strategic planning","Continuous time systems; Costs; Electric vehicles; Inventory control; Investments; Optimal control systems; Sales; Secondary batteries; Stages; Strategic planning; Battery swap stations; Battery swapping; Dynamic fluids; Electric vehicle batteries; Investment decisions; Pontryagin's maximum principle; Production and inventory control; Two stage optimizations; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067644991

The efficient and orderly introduction of AVs will require their acceptance by the public. Although the perspectives of members of the general public concerning AVs have been surveyed, no academic research has to date been completed on the views of AVs held by people with disabilities. The present study employs a mixed methods research methodology to assess attitudes towards AVs among a UK sample of individuals with physical disabilities that affected their mobility. Participants were asked open-endedly to express their thoughts about AVs and their responses were analysed using a structural topic modelling (STM) procedure. Outputs to the STM analysis were then employed in a structural equation model (SEM) constructed to predict the sample members’ willingness to travel in driverless vehicles. The results were compared against those obtained from a control group of people without physical disabilities. The attitudes towards AVs of people with disabilities differed significantly from the attitudes of the respondents without disabilities. Attitudes towards AVs among people with disabilities were significantly influenced by their levels of interest in new technology, generalised anxiety, intensity of a person's disability, prior knowledge of AVs, locus of control and action orientation. A latent class analysis confirmed the relevance of these variables as determinants of the views of people with disabilities regarding AVs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Action orientation; Anxiety; Disability; Driverless vehicles; Locus of control; Structured topic model; Technology interest; Transportation","Behavioral research; Transportation; Uranium metallography; Action-orientation; Anxiety; Disability; Driverless; Locus of control; Topic Modeling; Autonomous vehicles; disability; numerical model; public attitude; regression analysis; technological development; transportation system; unmanned vehicle; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068937224

On the one hand, firms want controlled and selective participation, clarity of purpose, and a choice of ideas based on their own current capacity and value appropriation strategies. On the other, their external contributors tend to want open and unfettered participation, the creative potential of the idea per se, and unrestricted knowledge sharing. This article proposes to shift the conceptual frame from looking at the tensions between control and openness as problems to looking at them as synergies.

However, there has not been much research on the characteristics of UGC on these platforms and, correspondingly, their impact on customer engagement. In this paper, we analyze user-generated posts from Facebook business pages of multiple companies to understand what users post on Facebook business pages and how post valence and content characteristics affect engagement, measured as the number of likes and comments received by a post. We control for a variety of factors, including post linguistic features, poster characteristics, and post context heterogeneity. Our analysis demonstrates that for user-generated posts on Facebook business pages, negative posts are significantly more prevalent than positive posts, which contrasts with the J-shaped valence distribution of online consumer reviews. We also show that engagement depends not only on the valence of a post but also on the specific ways in which a post is positive or negative. We observe three types of customer complaints, respectively, related to product and service quality, money issues, and social and environmental issues. Our analyses show that social complaints receive more likes, but fewer comments, than quality or money complaints. Such nuances can only be uncovered by analyzing the actual post content, going beyond the valence of the posts. Furthermore, we theoretically discuss and empirically demonstrate that liking and commenting are engagement behaviors with different antecedents. For example, positive posts tend to attract more likes yet fewer comments than neutral posts. Overall, our research shows that user-generated posts on Facebook business pages represent a distinctive form of UGC that is conceptually different from online consumer reviews. Our work advances the knowledge on UGC and has practical implications for firms’ social media marketing strategy.

While sharing is vital for value creation, protecting is critical for value appropriation. Prior research has examined this paradox of openness from the perspective of the seeking firm, focusing on the firm-level challenges of inbound open innovation. In this article, we complement that research by illuminating the tensions between sharing and protecting in individual-level outbound open innovation, where we argue that the paradox of openness is most prevalent, yet much less well understood. Drawing on the experience of individual participants, or solvers, in intermediated crowdsourcing contests, we analyze textual data from 2,149 answers to five open-ended narrative questions embedded in a large-scale solver survey, as well as 43 in-depth interviews of solvers. Our findings indicate that individual solvers face fundamental sharing-protecting tensions that carry considerable economic and psychological costs. We also document how solvers attempt to navigate the paradox of openness by employing three formal and four informal value appropriation practices. They build elaborate configurations of these practices, which they tailor to the idiosyncrasies of each contest. They also dynamically adjust these configurations over time, as the contest and the interaction with the seeker unfold. We end by outlining how these findings contribute to a more multifaceted conceptualization and a richer understanding of the paradox of openness. © 2019 The Authors","Crowdsourcing; Open innovation; Paradox of openness; Value appropriation; Value capture","Navigation; Surveys; In-depth interviews; Individual levels; Knowledge protection; Knowledge-sharing; Open innovation; Paradox of openness; Value appropriation; Value captures; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060873817

Most of these studies find corruption, transparency, accountability, weak institutions and poor governance as causes of developing countries’ natural resource ‘curse’. However, recent studies identify a strong association between oil and gas multinational corporations (MNCs) as agents of globalisation and the resource-curse. First, we consider the international dimensions of this relationship and how MNCs have an influence on the resources of ODCs. Second, we link the impact of MNCs and their natural resource nexus to broaden debates on strategic organisational practices. We show that globalisation creates the platform for the natural resource ‘curse’ phenomenon. Our findings offer new insights into the natural resource ‘curse’ debates. We expand knowledge on the traditional focus of the resource-curse literature to include globalisation and how ethical practices of MNCs could avert the ‘curse’ or allow ODCs to experience the advantages of their natural resource wealth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Globalisation; Management strategies; Natural resource ‘curse’; Oil and gas multinational corporations; Profit maximisation","Developing countries; Economics; Ethical practices; Globalisation; Management strategies; Multi-national corporations; Organisational; Resource curse; Resource endowments; Socio-economics; Natural resources; accountability; developing world; economic growth; gas industry; globalization; governance approach; multinational enterprise; natural resource; oil industry; profitability; resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061427240

Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, WA  98195, United States","In recent years, there has been substantial outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) from China to other countries. Meanwhile, China has taken green development as one of its core future strategies. Questions arise as to whether the OFDI of China brings green spillovers towards home, and should the government encourage OFDI to further promote the domestic green economy? To answer these questions, this study examines empirically the reverse spillovers of China's OFDI on its domestic green development. Based on a panel dataset involving 30 provinces, provincial green total factor productivity (GTFP) is calculated and its relationship with OFDI is discussed for the period of 2006–2015. Then the main results demonstrate whether China's OFDI has green spillovers on the domestic economy and to what extent they depend on provincial heterogeneity in terms of absorptive capability and environmental regulation stringency. At the national level, it is only either when employees in every province have more than 12 years of schooling on average or the environmental legal construction index reaches approximately 611 that China's OFDI can generate significant spillovers towards its green economic growth, such that a rise of 1 unit of OFDI is associated with 2.4% and 3.2% increases in GTFP, respectively. Moreover, green benefits from OFDI cannot be found in the home country unless the stock of OFDI reaches a certain level, i.e., beyond approximately 3361 Chinese yuan (RMB) per capita at the 2005 constant price. At the provincial level, the influence of OFDI on the green economy in the eastern provinces is greater than that in other provinces. Additionally, this study finds that the relationships between OFDI, absorptive capability, environmental regulation stringency, and green economic growth are robust to multiple econometric methods and alternative proxies for threshold variables. Overall, it is indicated that China's OFDI does bring green spillovers to China, but the current effects show large heterogeneities across provinces and are still very limited due to the lack of necessary supporting conditions. Even with the dramatically rising scale, OFDI in most of Chinese provinces has only small effects on local transition to the green economy, calling for the formulation of proper policies to encourage OFDI and enhance its green spillover effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China's outward foreign direct investment; Emerging economy; Green spillover effect; Home economy; “Going-out” strategy","Economic analysis; Investments; Absorptive capability; Emerging economies; Foreign direct investments; Home economy; Legal constructions; Spillover effects; Supporting conditions; Total factor productivity; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060935965

We argue that selecting a reasonable pool of forecasts is fundamental in the modelling process and in this context both forecast selection and combination can be seen as two extreme pools of forecasts. We evaluate forecast pooling approaches and find them beneficial in terms of forecast accuracy.

Drawing on research on the importance of employee-level behaviors for the success of corporate sustainability initiatives, we focus on the proenvironmental behaviors (PEBs) of Russian employees. We integrate scholarship on employees’ PEBs and the Russian cultural context to offer theory regarding three potentially important antecedents of employees’ PEBs: top management commitment to sustainability, the immediate manager's environmental leadership, and the employee's motivation. Using self-report data from management development program attendees in Russia (N = 165), we examined the links between these factors and employees’ PEBs. We also tested whether top management commitment moderated the impact of immediate managers’ leadership on employees’ PEBs. We found that the immediate manager's active environmental leadership (i.e., transformational, contingent reward, and active management by exception) was positively related to employees’ PEBs. Managers’ passive-avoidant environmental leadership (i.e., passive management by exception and laissez-faire) was negatively related to PEBs, but only when top management was committed to sustainability. Employees’ motives were linked to PEBs, but the nature of the relationship varied across motives. External motivation was negatively related to PEBs, suggesting that using rewards to motivate PEBs may be detrimental. Motivation that came from a desire to fulfill one's values or avoid feeling bad about oneself was positively associated with PEBs. Our work provides a foundation for future research on PEBs in Russia, and suggests new directions for research on employees’ PEBs in other settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate environmental sustainability; Employee proenvironmental behaviors; Leadership; Motivation; Russia; Self-determination theory","Computer supported cooperative work; Environmental management; Human resource management; Managers; Motivation; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability; Leadership; Pro-environmental behaviors; Russia; Self-determination theories; Behavioral research; behavior; environmentalism; leadership; management; sustainability; article; employee; environmental sustainability; human; human experiment; leadership; major clinical study; manager; motivation; reward; Russian Federation; self report; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053463573

Although DEA is regarded as non-parametric, the sample size can be an issue of great importance in determining the efficiency scores for the evaluated units, empirically, when the use of too many inputs and outputs may result in a significant number of DMUs being rated as efficient. In the DEA literature, empirical rules have been established to avoid too many DMUs being rated as efficient. These empirical thresholds relate the number of variables with the number of observations. When the number of DMUs is below the empirical threshold levels, the discriminatory power among the DMUs may weaken, which leads to the data set not being suitable to apply traditional DEA models. In the literature, the lack of discrimination is often referred to as the “curse of dimensionality”. To overcome this drawback, we provide a simple approach to increase the discriminatory power between efficient and inefficient DMUs using the well-known pure DEA model, which considers either inputs only or outputs only.

As the number of DMUs increases, the running-time to solve the standard model sharply rises. In this study, a new framework is proposed to significantly decrease the required DEA calculation time in comparison with the existing methodologies when a large set of DMUs (e.g., 20,000 DMUs or more) is present. The framework includes five steps: (i) selecting a subsample of DMUs using a proposed algorithm, (ii) finding the best-practice DMUs in the selected subsample, (iii) finding the exterior DMUs to the hull of the selected subsample, (iv) identifying the set of all efficient DMUs, and (v) measuring the performance scores of DMUs as those arising from the traditional DEA approach. The variable returns to scale technology is assumed and several simulation experiments are designed to estimate the running-time for applying the proposed method for big data. The obtained results in this study point out that the running-time is decreased up to 99.9% in comparison with the existing techniques. In addition, we illustrate the essential computation time for applying the proposed method as a function of the number of DMUs (cardinality), number of inputs and outputs (dimension), and the proportion of efficient DMUs (density).

An example is cross-channel fulfillment, which allows a store to fulfill online orders in any location. Another is price transparency, which allows customers to compare the online price with store prices. This paper studies a new and widespread problem resulting from omnichannel retail: price optimization in the presence of cross-channel interactions in demand and supply, where cross-channel fulfillment is exogenous. We propose two pricing policies that are based on the idea of “partitions” to the store inventory that approximate how this shared resource will be utilized. These policies are practical because they rely on solving computationally tractable mixed integer programs that can accept various business and pricing rules. In extensive simulation experiments, they achieve a small optimality gap relative to theoretical upper bounds on the optimal expected profit. The good observed performance of our pricing policies results from managing substitutive channel demands in accordance with partitions that rebalance inventory in the network. A proprietary implementation of the analytics is commercially available as part of the IBM Commerce markdown price solution. The system results in an estimated 13.7% increase in clearance-period revenue based on causal model analysis of the data from a pilot implementation for clearance pricing at a large U.S. retailer. © 2019 INFORMS","Attraction demand; Cross-channel; E-commerce fulfillment; Elasticity; Markdown pricing; Omnichannel; Pricing","Elasticity; Electronic commerce; Integer programming; Retail stores; Sales; Attraction demand; Cross-channel; Extensive simulations; Markdown pricing; Mixed-integer programs; Omnichannel; Pilot implementation; Seamless integration; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067664305

This paper endeavors to clarify some drivers of science and technology (S&T) of nations. The thesis of this paper is that nations produce science advances and new technology to endorse a socio economic power and leadership directed to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with environmental threats in competitive settings. In general, science advances and new technology are due to organized social and economic efforts of nations to achieve breakthroughs directed to support national interests of institutions and wellbeing of population. In particular, the production of science advances and new technology is driven by individuals, which have the natural tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to explore, to learn and to achieve goals within efficient organizations in line with national interests.

This study aims to contribute to both theoretical research of material flow analysis and timely management of EOL EV batteries at various geographic scales (i.e., national, state, and county). Theoretically, this study tests two battery lifespan scenarios (i.e., constantly at 3–8 years and dynamically increasing over time), three discard probability functions (i.e., uniform, truncated normal, and Weibull), and three EV sale projections (i.e., low, moderate, and high). Results show that the short-term EOL volume (by 2025) can be particularly sensitive to the lifespan parameter. The long-term estimates involve most uncertainties related to the EV market penetration. Various discard probability functions generally derive similar results. In practical terms, the results suggest that necessary infrastructure for proper EOL EV battery management is needed sooner than the public may have perceived. This study urges for regional planning that incorporates both temporal and spatial considerations. To illustrate an example of regional solutions, this study adopts empirical data in California to simulate and spatially match EOL EV battery clusters and the renewable energy facilities that can potentially reuse EV batteries as energy storage. Meanwhile, the spatial mis-match between the supply and demand, as can be the case in other regions, calls for region-wide coordination in terms of both infrastructure development and transportation planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Batteries; Electric vehicles (EV); End-of-life management; Material flow analysis; Product flow analysis; Waste management","Battery management systems; Digital storage; Economics; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Regional planning; Solar cells; Solid wastes; Uncertainty analysis; Waste management; Weibull distribution; Electric vehicle batteries; Electric Vehicles (EVs); End of life managements; Infrastructure development; Material flow analysis; Probability functions; Product flow; Transportation planning; Automotive batteries; electric vehicle; electronic equipment; inventory; material flow analysis; modeling; spatial analysis; uncertainty analysis; waste disposal; waste management; article; California; coordination; flow measurement; lifespan; market; probability; renewable energy; spatial analysis; storage; theoretical study; uncertainty; waste management; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062386206

These standards entail increased levels of complexity to be addressed by appropriately designed tools, such as the Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process (VAHP) proposed by Liu and Hai (2005). This method of multi-criteria group decision making structures decision criteria in a hierarchical fashion as per Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) for deriving criteria weights from the ordinal preferences of the group members. Compared to AHP, the method permits a simpler application in a group decision context. However, its theoretical underpinnings have been questioned in the literature. This specifically concerns (i) the requirement of a strong convex order for the importance weights of ordinal rank gradations, and (ii) the choice of discrimination threshold for consecutive rank weights in the underlying DEA model. We propose a revised VAHP method that overcomes both issues (i) and (ii) by pursuing a game-theoretic approach to elicitation of criteria weights — so as to remove subjectivity from rank discrimination. We illustrate the application of the method on a real-world problem of sustainable supplier selection. We contribute to theory by proposing a more robust VAHP tool that helps supply chain and purchasing managers selecting suppliers based on a comprehensive set of criteria spanning all three sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental, and social), while coping with parsimonious input by group decision-makers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Game theory; Group decisions; Multi-criteria decision making; Ordinal preferences; Preference aggregation; Supplier selection; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Data envelopment analysis; Game theory; Hierarchical systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Group decision; Multi criteria decision making; Ordinal preference; Preference aggregations; Supplier selection; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061664920

Our goal in this paper is to study how policy adjustments over time will interact with production decisions from the industry. We model the interaction between a government and an industry player in a two-period game setting under uncertain demand. We show how the timing of decisions affects the risk sharing between the government and the supplier, ultimately affecting the cost of the subsidy program. In particular, we show that when the government commits to a fixed policy, it encourages the supplier to produce more at the beginning of the horizon. Consequently, a flexible subsidy policy is on average more expensive, unless there is a significant negative demand correlation across time periods. However, we show that the variance of the total sales is lower in the flexible setting, implying that the government's additional spending reduces the adoption level uncertainty. In addition, we show that for flexible policies, the supplier is better off in terms of expected profits, whereas the consumers can either benefit or not depending on the price elasticity of demand. Finally, we test our insights with a numerical example calibrated on data from a solar subsidy program. © 2018 INFORMS.","Commitment; Government subsidies; Newsvendor; Strategic supplier","Economic analysis; Risk management; Sales; Software testing; Commitment; Expected profits; Government subsidies; Newsvendors; Price-elasticity of demand; Production decisions; Strategic suppliers; Timing of decisions; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063404078

With videos and corresponding transcripts of interviews with emerging market CEOs, we use this synthesis of methods to discover five distinct communication styles that incorporate both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication. Our data comprises interviews that represent unedited expressions and content, making them especially suitable as data sources for the measurement of an individual's communication style. We then perform a proof-of-concept analysis, correlating CEO communication styles to M&A outcomes, highlighting the value of combining text and videographic data to define styles. We also discuss the benefits of using our methods versus current research methods. Managerial Summary: CEOs spend most of their time communicating to investors, customers, and partners with the aim of influencing these various stakeholders. To what extent though does their effectiveness as leaders depend on a mixture of what they say and how they say it? We use cutting-edge machine learning approaches to measure a CEO's communication style, which can give clues about the major strategic decisions a CEO's firm must make. With a collection of video interviews with 61 organizational leaders from emerging markets, we use textual analysis and facial image expression recognition to code whether CEOs are “excitable,” “stern,” “dramatic,” “rambling,” and “melancholy” in their communication styles. As a proof-of-concept, we also show that CEOs who were more dramatic in expressing themselves were also less likely to oversee major acquisitions. Therefore, not only can CEO communication styles help predict a firm's ability to grow, adapt to change, and reallocate existing assets, styles can also be coded more intuitively by using our new method, representing a vast improvement over previous methods in both accessibility and interpretability. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CEO oral communication; image analysis; machine learning; managerial cognitive capability; topic modeling","Commerce; Cutting tools; Edge detection; Image coding; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Managers; Neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Cognitive capability; Communication styles; Convolutional neural network; Expression recognition; Machine learning approaches; Oral communication; Strategic decisions; Topic Modeling; Image analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070722812

Such partnerships are typically governed by contractual or equity arrangements with clear mutual obligations. More recently, however, organizations have begun to seek strategic partnerships with open innovation communities, which are novel digitally enabled forms of organizing, and where contractual commitments are not possible. Thus, selecting the right open innovation community as an alliance partner becomes a more complex decision. We follow how the organizational decision makers, in two technology firms that were pioneers of forming strategic alliances with open innovation communities, developed metrics around making such decisions. We build upon Shah and Swaminathan's (2008) contingency model of alliance partner selection and consider how it applies to the case of partnering with open innovation communities. This framework was useful in to frame our findings, yet our work recognizes and builds upon two key differences: 1) the evaluation metrics used in selecting an open innovation community were more focused on value creation than value capture; and 2) open ecosystem considerations, and not just partner-specific metrics, featured prominently in this type of alliance partner evaluation. We develop the notions of community and ecosystem health to refer to these new metrics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Company engagement with open source; Company-community relationship; Open ecosystem; Open innovation; Open source community; Partner selection; Strategic alliances","Decision making; Technology transfer; Open innovation; Open source communities; Open sources; Partner selection; Strategic alliance; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063741188

In recent years, food leftover sharing (FLS) platforms that can provide a means to collect the unsold food products from individual retailers and create values from them have emerged. Motivated by this real world observation, we build a single supplier multi-retailer analytical supply chain model to explore the value of this kind of FLS platform. In the decentralized supply chain setting, we prove that the presence of FLS platform is beneficial to the retailers, the supplier, the consumers and the environment. Whether it benefits the supply chain economically depends on the logistics costs (incurred from the food product leftover collection by the FLS platform). We extend the analysis to the case with a centralized supply chain and show that the FLS platform is guaranteed to help improve the environment, but the consumers and the supply chain are only benefited when the logistics costs are sufficiently small. Sensitivity analyses are conducted which show that for both centralized and decentralized supply chain settings, the FLS platform is especially helpful in enhancing social welfare when the unit food product leftover cost is higher, the unit benefit derived from reusing the food product leftovers is higher, or the unit logistics cost is lower. We further consider the case when the logistics cost with the use of platform is high and propose the use of government sponsors to help and provide the conditions under which this sponsor is well-justified with respect to social welfare enhancement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Platforms; Product leftover management; Sharing economy; Social welfare","Cost benefit analysis; Food products; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Centralized supply chains; Decentralized supply chains; Fresh vegetables; Platforms; Sharing economy; Sharing platforms; Social welfare; Supply chain modeling; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063115517

Future leaders must make decisions from an informed position and the public will need to embed climate change mitigation tools into their work and private life. It is therefore essential to understand the range of CCE strategies being taken globally by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and to explore and analyse the ways that HEIs could better address this challenge. Consistent with this research need, this paper offers an analysis of the extent to which HEIs in 45 countries approach CCE and provides a conceptual framework for exploring how HEIs are embedding CCE into their curricula. In addition to the specialist approach (where students choose to study a degree to become experts in climate change adaptation and mitigation tools), the CCE framework developed identifies and highlights three other approaches HEIs can deploy to embed CCE: Piggybacking, mainstreaming and connecting (transdisciplinary). Using data gathered in an explorative international survey involving participants working across academic and senior management, this paper illustrates the different approaches taken and analyses practical examples of current CCE practice from across the world. Responses from 212 university staff from 45 countries indicated that CCE was highly variable – no clear pattern was identified at the country level, with CCE approaches varying significantly, even within individual HEIs. This plurality highlights the wide range of ideas and examples being shared and used by institutions in very different countries and contexts, and underlines the importance of the independence and autonomy of HEIs so that they can choose the right CCE approaches for them.

A question arises, then, whether stock market values reflect the interdependence of security breaches and investments. In this paper, we used the event study methodology to investigate how a firm's security breaches and IT security investments influence its competitors. We collected and reviewed 118 information security breaches and 98 IT security investment announcements from 2010 to 2017. We found substantial evidence supporting our hypothesis that information security breaches do, indeed, have a competition effect: when one firm is breached, its competitors have opportunities to absorb market power. For the IT security investment announcements, however, we observed the positive externalities, or contagion effect, in play: market investors feel that the security investments made by one firm increase the security level of the entire network, and hence, competitors also get benefits. Additionally, we found that the competition effect was higher when the breaches occurred after the preceding security investments than when there were no preceding investments before the breaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Breach; Event study; Externalities; Information security; Information transfer effect; Investment","Commerce; Security of data; Security systems; Breach; Event studies; Externalities; Information systems security; Information transfers; IT security investments; Security environments; Security investments; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057034121

While international organisations and institutions, such as the United Nations and the European Union (EU), mobilised around the grand challenge of sustainability, on both a local and a global scale, eco-innovation as a key concept (or buzzword) started emerging and consolidating in policy documents and funding schemes. By focusing on the European context, this paper aims to explore how the discourse of eco-innovation has been framed by the EU research funding programmes Horizon 2020 since the introduction of the 2011 Eco-Innovation Action Plan. The review was conducted by using content analysis methods designed to disclose the framing of eco-innovation in the EU programmes. The article presents three main findings: the eco-innovation discourse in the EU programmes has mostly become constructed around the notion of eco-efficiency; eco-innovation is overwhelmingly framed as a dialectic between the state vs private actors whereas stakeholders in the third sector such as cooperatives, non-governmental organisations, social enterprises, and community-based initiatives are largely neglected; eco-innovation as a buzzword has been losing relevance through the years in favour of the new rising discourse of the ‘circular economy’. The article concludes by suggesting that the construction of a new discourse on circular economy may provide opportunities to embrace more eco-centric and inclusive approaches to economics, towards stronger sustainability and the more systematic inclusion of not-for-profit organisations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-efficiency; Eco-innovation; European Union policy; Horizon 2020","Data mining; Economics; Efficiency; Sustainable development; Content analysis method; Eco-efficiency; Eco-innovation; European context; European Union policy; Horizon 2020; Non-governmental organisations; Social enterprise; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060352090

It can help in determining conditions of returned EOL products with the help of sensors and RFID tags, which then can be used to decide a feasible recovery process for the EOL product amongst disassembly, remanufacturing, recycling or disposal. Product design is a key criterion which affects the choice of recovery process. Complex product designs will increase the cost of disassembly which will lead to higher recovery costs. Therefore, considering the recovery operations during a product's design phase can lead to effective recovery process after its EOL. In order to see the effect of product design on product recovery using IoT, this paper proposes an Advanced-Remanufacturing-To-Order-Disassembly-To-Order (ARTODTO) system which receives sensors and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags embedded End-Of-Life (EOL) products to satisfy various products, components and materials demands. The received EOL products can be recovered via disassembly to meet the components demands, remanufactured to meet the products demands or recycled to meet the materials demands. The remaining EOL products can be disposed of. The model evaluates different designs of a product for the ease of disassembly and remanufacturing based on three criteria viz., total profit, quality level and the number of disposed items. To solve the proposed multi-criteria decision-making model, linear physical programming is used. An example of laptops is considered for illustration of the proposed methodology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Disassembly; Internet of things; Linear physical programming; Product design; Remanufacturing","Decision making; Internet of things; Quality control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Recycling; Disassembly; End-of-life products; Evaluation of designs; Internet of Things (IOT); Linear physical programming; Multi-criteria decision-making models; Radio-frequency-identification tags (RFID); Remanufacturing; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058382379

We use data from a randomized field experiment run on the website of a top retailer in North America across 82,290 products and 1,138,238 users. We report four main findings. First, we demonstrate and quantify across a wide range of product categories that the use of traditional collaborative filters (CFs) is associated with a decrease in sales diversity relative to a world without product recommendations. Furthermore, the design of the CF matters. CFs based on purchase data are associated with a greater effect size than those based on product views. Second, the decrease in aggregate sales diversity may not always be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in individual-level consumption diversity. In fact, it is even possible for individual consumption diversity to increase while aggregate sales diversity decreases. Third, copurchase network analyses show that while recommenders can help individuals explore new products, similar users still end up exploring the same kinds of products, resulting in concentration bias at the aggregate level. Fourth and finally, there is a difference between absolute and relative impact on niche items. Specifically, absolute sales and views for niche items in fact increase, but their gains are smaller compared with the gains in views and sales for popular items. Thus, whereas niche items gain in absolute terms, they lose out in terms of market share. We discuss economic impacts and managerial implications. © 2019, INFORMS.","Collaborative filtering; Consumer purchase behavior; E-commerce; Gini coefficient; Personalization; Recommender systems; Sales diversity","Aggregates; Collaborative filtering; Competition; Consumer behavior; Electronic commerce; Purchasing; Recommender systems; Consumer purchase; Gini coefficients; Individual levels; Managerial implications; Personalizations; Product categories; Product recommendation; Recommender algorithms; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065439836

However, there are few studies on carbon emissions performance for the logistics industry, especially at the city level. Therefore, this study attempts to analyse the carbon emissions performance of the logistics industry at the city level by examining sixteen cities within Yunnan Province. In particular, the Data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Malmquist index from both the static and dynamic perspective were explored. To further capture the driving factors of the carbon emissions performance in logistics, the Tobit model was applied to perform regression analysis. The results indicate that (1) with regards to static performance, two northwest cities, Nujiang and Diqing, have reached the technological frontier; (2) regarding dynamic performance, although six cities have improved, the average dynamic logistics carbon emissions performance of all the cities decreases by approximately 5.9% from 2011 to 2015; (3) in terms of driving factors, the economic development factor is found to be positively and significantly related to static carbon emissions performance, whereas others indicate negative and significant relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions performance; City level; Data envelopment analysis; Logistics industry; Malmquist index","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Carbon emissions; City level; Dynamic performance; Economic development; Logistics industry; Low carbon economy; Malmquist indices; Static performance; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067072869

This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance.

The uncertainty of future demand and capital cost reduction is modelled by means of a scenario tree configuration, whereas the uncertainty of fuel prices is approached through Monte Carlo simulation. Global environmental concerns have rendered essential not only the satisfaction of the energy demand at the least cost but also the mitigation of the environmental impact of the power generation system. As such, renewable energy penetration, CO 2,eq mitigation targets, and fuel diversity are imposed through a set of constraints to align the power generation mix in accordance to the sustainability targets. The model is, then, applied to the Indonesian power generation system context and results are derived for three cases: Least Cost option, Policy Compliance option and Green Energy Policy option.

To address the research gaps identified in the literature, we draw on crime opportunity theory and the affordance perspective to propose a meta-framework that guides our investigation into SNS bullying. The meta-framework explains how SNS affordances give rise to the evaluation of favorable SNS environmental conditions for SNS bullying, which, in turn, promote SNS bullying. The research model was empirically tested using a longitudinal online survey of 223 SNS users.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects that innovation capabilities have on the business performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within the context of a regional developing and emerging economy of Mexico, in this case, Aguascalientes. Design/methodology/approach: The approach of this study is quantitative. Four research hypotheses were formulated and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). Data were collected through a questionnaire survey responded by 308 SMEs located in the Aguascalientes state of Mexico. Findings: The results obtained show that innovation in products, processes, marketing and management has a positive and significant effect on the business return of Mexican SMEs. Originality/value: The paper complements the limited body of knowledge currently existent in the SMEs innovation literature, particularly when compared to that of large organisations. Similar works in other settings have provided mixed results in regards to the effects that innovation capabilities have on the business performance of SMEs. Thus, this paper offers a refined understanding and validation of the relationship between innovation capabilities and business performance, especially within the context of SMEs, and insights into some of the innovation aspects that managers may consider when formulating the strategies of their organisations. Finally, it enables such relationship to be understood within a particular situation, contributing in this manner to expand the body of knowledge in the innovation field. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation capabilities; Mexico; Performance; SMEs","Commerce; Design/methodology/approach; Innovation capability; Me-xico; Performance; Questionnaire surveys; Small and medium-sized enterprise; SMEs; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049630873

It establishes which resources small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) should invest in to be more successful in following environmental principles. The findings of a survey of the owner‐managers of Australian wine‐producing SMEs are reported, and partial least squares structural equation modelling is utilized to analyze the data. Results clearly indicate that successful firms that manage their resources more effectively influence the application of environmental behaviour, with one distinct resource significantly influencing the disclosure of such behaviour.

Central to the closed-loop paradigm is remanufacturing: the restoration of used products to useful life. While this operational model has huge potential to extend product life-cycles, the collection and recovery processes diminish the effectiveness of existing control mechanisms for open-loop systems. We systematically review the literature in the field of closed-loop supply chain dynamics, which explores the time-varying interactions of material and information flows in the different elements of remanufacturing supply chains. We supplement this with further reviews of what we call the three ‘pillars’ of such systems, i.e. forecasting, collection, and inventory and production control. This provides us with an interdisciplinary lens to investigate how a ‘boomerang’ effect (i.e. sale, consumption, and return processes) impacts on the behaviour of the closed-loop system and to understand how it can be controlled. To facilitate this, we contrast closed-loop supply chain dynamics research to the well-developed research in each pillar; explore how different disciplines have accommodated the supply, process, demand, and control uncertainties; and provide insights for future research on the dynamics of remanufacturing systems. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The underlying rationale is that the collective intelligence of a large number of contributors outside the firm's boundaries increases the likelihood of achieving ‘extreme outcomes’, i.e., high quality ideas with exceptional business potential. Due to the idiosyncrasies that differentiate crowdsourcing from other forms of OI, the findings from prior research on the performance implications of OI cannot be directly extended to crowdsourcing. Similarly, the findings on the effect of internal R&D on firm performance cannot be directly applied to crowdsourcing due to the greater uncertainty in dealing with a crowd of unknown individuals outside the organization whose ideas have to be evaluated and ultimately processed internally. Thus, while crowdsourcing research has recently burgeoned, it is ambiguous as to whether and when crowdsourcing is beneficial for firms. In fact, the overall effect of crowdsourcing on a firm's future profits has not been thoroughly investigated. To fill this gap, we conducted an event study analyzing stock market reactions to crowdsourcing announcements, a forward-looking market-based measure able to isolate the effect of crowdsourcing on a firm's future profits, which we refer to as firm stock market performance. Drawing on the resource-based view, we argue that an external crowd can become a valuable resource if the firm is able to extract value from it. Our findings show that two key contingency factors, i.e., brand value and investment opportunities, determine the boundary conditions that enable firms to extract value from the crowd, resulting in a positive stock market reaction to the announcement of a crowdsourcing campaign. In addition to advancing scholarly knowledge on crowdsourcing, our results provide practitioners with relevant indications for profitable crowdsourcing campaigns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Brand value; Crowdsourcing; Investment opportunities; Open innovation; R&D; Stock market performance","Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Profitability; Brand values; Collective intelligences; Contingency factors; Investment opportunities; Market-based measures; Open innovation; Resource-based view; Stock market performance; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068734216

Chlorination is the most prevalent and the cheapest method in this regard. One of the most significant factors in chlorination is the location and the amount of chlorine injections, both of which must be chosen in a way that the amount of chlorine remaining in all sections of a city’s water distribution network is within the standard range, and the associated costs are reduced to a considerable extent. Therefore, in this research, we have implemented a technique which takes both of those issues, i.e., the amount of residual chlorine in pipes and the quantity of chlorine consumed in diverse sections of the water distribution network into account leading to a much more cost-effective water disinfection technique. Our technique shows that municipal water distribution network, are effectively in tune with the current highest standards set in the water disinfection procedure for the lowest possible cost. For modeling the water allocation network, the WaterGems software was used. Using this software, the network was modeled into two practical methods, i.e., gravity and direct pumping methods. The productivity of gravity as well as direct pumping methods was shown to control the optimal chlorine injection rate by resolving the two applied models of water distribution networks. The results showed that the residual chlorine content in 70% of the direct pipe network was within the standard range and in 100% of the tubes in the gravity distribution network lower than the standard. Also, the chlorine which was consumed in the direct pumping network was 7% lesser than that in the gravity distribution network. This research showed that the adjusting of chlorine injection into direct-pumped networks compared with gravity distribution networks was more feasible and also required less chlorine consumption. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Abstraction system; Qualitative examination; Residual chlorine; Simulation model; Water distribution network","chlorination; chlorine; computer simulation; disinfection; distribution system; numerical model; optimization; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086703080

Many factors intervene simultaneously and their hard-to-interpret interactions throughout the supply chain greatly complicate decision-making. The complexity clearly manifests itself in the field of inventory management, in which determining the optimal replenishment rule often becomes an intractable problem. This paper applies machine learning to help managers understand these complex scenarios and better manage the inventory flow. Building on a dynamic framework, we employ an inductive learning algorithm for setting the most appropriate replenishment policy over time by reacting to the environmental changes. This approach proves to be effective in a three-echelon supply chain where the scenario is defined by seven variables (cost structure, demand variability, three lead times, and two partners’ inventory policy). Considering four alternatives, the algorithm determines the best replenishment rule around 88% of the time. This leads to a noticeable reduction of operating costs against static alternatives. Interestingly, we observe that the nodes are much more sensitive to inventory decisions in the lower echelons than in the upper echelons of the supply chain. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bullwhip Effect; inductive learning; inventory management; machine learning; replenishment policy; supply chain management","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Inventory control; Learning systems; Operating costs; Supply chain management; Bullwhip effects; Demand variability; Environmental change; Environmental conditions; Inductive learning; Inventory decisions; Inventory management; Replenishment policy; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058171214

Nevertheless, buyers sometimes struggle to persuade suppliers to adopt SCF quickly. To craft more effective supplier onboarding strategies, buyers need to know which suppliers are likely to adopt SCF faster. Drawing on the theoretical perspective on organizational motivation, we develop a research framework that uncovers the key drivers of supplier adoption speed. Our framework combines efficiency motive drivers, identified by recent analytical studies on SCF, with legitimacy motive drivers, which stem from a supplier's institutional environment and are new to the SCF literature. We test our hypotheses using a unique data set from a leading financial technology platform provider. We find that suppliers with more limited access to financing tend to adopt SCF faster. In addition, suppliers adopt SCF faster if such adoption is associated with more pronounced reductions in their financing costs. Legitimacy motive drivers also impact supplier adoption speed. Specifically, our results suggest that mimetic and normative pressures accelerate the speed at which suppliers adopt SCF, while coercive pressures seem to have such an effect only when the buyer's stakes are high. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","inter-organizational operations; OM-finance interface; supply chain finance; supply chain finance adoption","Sales; Statistical tests; Supply chains; Analytical studies; Coercive pressures; Empirical analysis; Inter-organizational; Normative pressures; Research frameworks; Supply chain finances; Technology platforms; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072869902

In this paper we propose a novel “trajectory-based” targeting strategy for mobile recommendation that leverages detailed information on consumers’ physical-movement trajectories using fine-grained behavioral information from different mobility dimensions. To analyze the effectiveness of this new strategy, we designed a large-scale randomized field experiment in a large shopping mall that involved 83,370 unique user responses for a 14-day period in June 2014. We found that trajectory-based mobile targeting can, as compared with other baselines, lead to higher redemption probability, faster redemption behavior, and higher transaction amounts. It can also facilitate higher revenues for the focal store as well as the overall shopping mall. Moreover, the effect of trajectory-based targeting comes not only from improvements in the efficiency of customers’ current shopping processes but also from its ability to nudge customers toward changing their future shopping patterns and, thereby, generate additional revenues. Finally, we found significant heterogeneity in the impact of trajectory-based targeting. It is especially effective in influencing high-income consumers. Interestingly, however, it becomes less effective in boosting the revenues of the shopping mall during the weekends and for those shoppers who like to explore across products categories. Our overall findings suggest that highly targeted mobile promotions can have the inadvertent impact of reducing impulse-purchasing behavior by customers who are in an exploratory shopping stage. On a broader note, our work can be viewed as a first step toward the study of large-scale, fine-grained digital traces of individual physical behavior and how they can be used to predict—and market according to—individuals’ anticipated future behavior. © 2019 INFORMS","Field experiment; GPS; Location-based advertising; Mobile targeting; Trajectory mining","Global positioning system; Sales; Shopping centers; Contextual information; Field experiment; Location-based advertising; Mobile recommendations; Mobile targeting; Physical movements; Purchasing behaviors; Trajectory minings; Trajectories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075332329

These digital platforms were originally heralded as a democratizing force in early stage finance, due to their role in facilitating the exchange between entrepreneurs and a multitude of non-professional small investors (“the crowd”). Equity crowdfunding platforms have experienced considerable growth and now attract professional investors including business angels. The presence of angels alongside the crowd on equity crowdfunding platforms has raised questions whether these digital platforms can continue to play their role in democratizing access to capital. Using data from a leading equity crowdfunding platform, we examine the interplay between the investment decisions of angels and the crowd. We find evidence of information flows in crowdfunding platforms between angels, and from angels to the crowd. We find angels play an important role in funding of large ventures, whereas the crowd not only fill the funding gaps for such large ventures but also play a pivotal role in the funding of small ones. The complementarity between angels and crowd investors seems to increase the overall efficiency in an otherwise highly asymmetric and uncertain market, confirming that digitization can indeed bring important benefits to venture investment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Angel investment; Equity crowdfunding; Signaling","Crowdsourcing; Signaling; Digital platforms; Digital transformation; Equity crowdfunding; Information flows; Investment decisions; Overall efficiency; Professional investors; Venture investment; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060843350

Many empirical studies have been conducted globally in the last decade about consumers’ mobile payment behavior. To analyze and synthesize the findings, a meta-analysis is conducted to build consensus about what factors significantly affect consumers’ mobile payment behavior. Overall, it is found that there is a high level of consensus among researchers that these factors, including perceived usefulness, perceived risk, social influence, trust and perceived ease of use, have significant impact over consumers’ intention to use mobile payment. While our meta-analysis supports most findings revealed in previous studies, there are also findings that cannot be supported. In addition, the place where consumers live is identified as a new factor that could potentially affect consumers mobile payment behavior. The practical significance of the current study is that consumers’ spending habit is difficult to change but can be adapted through careful design and awareness training around these significant factors. To encourage consumers’ adoption of mobile payment, especially in Western countries like US, the factors such as perceived usefulness, perceived risk, social influence, trust and perceived ease of use must be carefully considered and incorporated into mobile payment products and marketing campaigns. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Consumer mobile payment behavior; Intention to use; Meta-analysis; Mobile payment; Network graph of relationships; Place factor","Consumer behavior; Electronic money; Factor analysis; Global system for mobile communications; Consumer mobile payment behavior; Consumer spendings; Intention to use; Meta-analysis; Mobile payment; Network graph of relationship; Networks/graphs; Perceived usefulness; Place factor; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064944549

This research examines the impact of different information quality management strategies, and corresponding data collection design choices, on key dimensions of information quality in crowdsourced user-generated content. We conceptualize a contributor-centric information quality management approach focusing on instance-based data collection. We contrast it with the traditional consumer-centric fitness-for-use conceptualization of information quality that emphasizes class-based data collection. We present laboratory and field experiments conducted in a citizen science domain that demonstrate trade-offs between the quality dimensions of accuracy, completeness (including discoveries), and precision between the two information management approaches and their corresponding data collection designs. Specifically, we show that instance-based data collection results in higher accuracy, dataset completeness, and number of discoveries, but this comes at the expense of lower precision. We further validate the practical value of the instance-based approach by conducting an applicability check with potential data consumers (scientists, in our context of citizen science). In a follow-up study, we show, using human experts and supervised machine learning techniques, that substantial precision gains on instance-based data can be achieved with post-processing.

This paper systematically studies the historical rules, the driving mechanism, as well as the future trend of coal consumption in China. First, through comparative analysis and breakpoint regression, we find that there are three consecutive inverted U-shapes between China ‘s coal consumption and economic development from 1965 to 2016, and they reach inflection points in 1980, 1998, and 2013, respectively. Second, the LMDI decomposition analysis of coal consumption reveals that output effects and intensity effects jointly determine the overall trend of each inverted U, and structural effects play a key role in the formation of each inverted U-shaped inflection point. Finally, the forecast shows that coal consumption will decline at an average annual rate of 0.4% from 2017 to 2030, and by then it will be basically in a plateau period. There is a big gap between the consumption trend and the inverted U scenario. In order to bend the coal consumption curve downward and ensure that 2013 will become a long-term peak, the government should accelerate the optimization of the industrial structure and energy consumption structure, and improve coal consumption efficiency continuously through a mix of policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coal consumption; Economic growth; Forecast; Phased inverted-U","Coal; Curve fitting; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Coal consumption; Comparative analysis; Decomposition analysis; Economic development; Economic growths; Energy consumption structure; Industrial structures; Literature studies; Economic and social effects; coal; economic development; economic growth; energy efficiency; forecasting method; trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059903515

However, no study to date has examined the life cycle costs and eco-efficiency implications of cleaner production of disposable diapers. Therefore, this paper sets out to evaluate the economic and environmental savings that could be achieved by eco-design and cleaner production of disposable baby diapers. This involves the use of an optimised absorbent core and innovative bonding technologies to replace gluing systems in diaper manufacturing. The analysis is carried out at different production and consumption scales: a single production platform, a whole industrial plant, a country and the European Union (EU). A cradle-to-grave life cycle costing demonstrates that the novel design and manufacture of the so-called “glueless” diapers reduce costs by 11% compared to the conventional product. This is equivalent to saving €250 million at the EU level. Likewise, the eco-efficiency analysis shows that the glueless diapers are 7%–170% more eco-efficient (€/impact) than the standard diapers, depending on the environmental impact considered. Still, eco-design and cleaner production will not help to resolve the underlying critical issue of the linear material consumption and waste generation associated with the use of disposable baby diapers. Further industrial efforts must concentrate on finding solutions to facilitate implementation of circular economy principles for these products. This calls for the development of new circular business models as discussed in the paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Absorbent hygiene products; Cleaner production; Life cycle assessment; Resource efficiency; Sustainable business models","Absorption; Costs; Ecodesign; Efficiency; Glues; Gluing; Industrial economics; Industrial plants; Pollution control; Product design; Sustainable development; Absorbent hygiene products; Cleaner production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resource efficiencies; Sustainable business; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059339831

This situation, and consumers’ resulting sense of informedness, has led many to suggest that the need for business-to-consumer (B2C) salespeople is diminishing. Yet, despite these claims, many purchases—especially those associated with high prices and, therefore, high consumer involvement—still require consumers to interact with salespeople. This interaction, between consumers (at varying levels of informedness) and B2C salespeople, is the focus of the current study. Merging theories of consumer informedness and adaptive interpersonal influence, we suggest that the interaction between salesperson influence attempts and consumer informedness plays an important role in purchase decisions. To study this notion, Study 1 matches automobile shoppers’ survey responses with objective purchase data from 480 sales interactions. Study 2 is a scenario-based experiment that investigates informedness and influence in a financial services setting. The findings of both studies suggest that understanding a consumer’s informedness, and adapting the proper influence approach to it, is critical if salespeople are to influence modern consumers’ purchase decisions and, thus, avoid irrelevancy. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.","Adaptiveness; Informed consumer; Informedness; Purchase decisions; Sales; Seller influence tactics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054761412

Despite the growing number of product returns, there is limited research that focuses on customers' perception of the return process in an omni-channel retail environment. To fill this gap, via an empirical analysis, this paper examines the influential factors on customers' return channel loyalty. Our structural equation modeling results found that perceived risk, purchase-return channel consistency, monetary cost, and hassle cost influence customers' return channel loyalty. Comparatively, perceived risk has the highest impact on customers' return channel loyalty. Additionally, hassle cost has more influence than monetary cost on customers' return channel loyalty. We also found that both internal (ambiguity tolerance, patience, and familiarity)and external (return policy flexibility)factors influence customers' perceived risk. Comparatively, channel familiarity has a higher influence on reducing customers' perceived risk compared with patience and the channel's return policy flexibility. Understanding customers' perceptions of a return channel is the first step in the implementation of an effective return management strategy in an omni-channel retail environment. This first step will provide retailers with opportunities to better understand the needs of targeted customers, offer improved post-sales services, and optimize their handling of product returns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Customer loyalty; Omni-channel; Perceived risk; Product returns","Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Ambiguity tolerances; Customer loyalty; Empirical analysis; Influential factors; Omni-channel; Perceived risk; Product returns; Structural equation modeling; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065401910

Unlike the traditional solution approaches in which we need to identify the efficient DMUs by the SBM model of Tone (2001) [20] before applying the super SBM model of Tone (2002) [21] for the DMUs to achieve their super-efficiency scores, our integration can obtain the efficiency scores of the inefficient DMUs and the super-efficiency scores of the efficient DMUs by solving simultaneously these two models by an one-stage approach. Therefore, it may save computational time for large-scale practical applications. Due to the non-linearity in the objective function of this integrated model, we develop a linearisation technique to deal with the non-linear model.

However, as traditional labor-intensive enterprises, construction companies do not pay enough attention to knowledge management, and the characteristics of projects increase knowledge loss to a certain extent. This results in the knowledge-transfer performance of a project network not being ideal and work efficiency reduction. This paper aims to explore knowledge-transfer factors and their relationships in construction project cooperation networks (CPCNs). A framework model and hypotheses were formulated through literature research, theoretical analysis, and practical experience. The authors applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses based on a questionnaire survey data set of 210 workers from Chinese construction companies. The results showed that, in the context of Chinese relationships, the temporary nature of projects will not affect knowledge transfer in CPCNs. The urgency of projects will positively affect parts of network members' knowledge transfer. The relationship between knowledge suppliers and recipients plays a critical role in mediating the influences of project characteristics on knowledge-transfer performance. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction project; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Network","Construction industry; Efficiency; Knowledge management; Networks (circuits); Statistical tests; Surveys; Construction companies; Construction projects; Knowledge transfer; Knowledge transfer mechanisms; Knowledge transfer performance; Project characteristics; Questionnaire surveys; Structural equation modeling; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057465897

The competitiveness of tourism destinations often depends on these entrepreneurs and therefore understanding their motivations and work patterns is critical. Research on individual wellbeing increasingly builds on the concept of quality of life (QoL). Hospitality and tourism literature so far predominantly focused on investigating QoL for tourists and residents, rather than for entrepreneurs’ QoL, even though being key stakeholders in the hospitality industry. Therefore, this study explores the factors influencing hospitality entrepreneurs’ quality of life (“HE-QoL”) and how these relate to business growth. Results of a 380 hospitality entrepreneurs’ survey identify six distinct factors of HE-QoL. Two groups of HE-QoL are identified with significant differences in fitness level activity, entrepreneurial competencies and business growth. Findings lead to recommendations to reduce stress to improve HE-QoL, and to develop entrepreneurial competencies, which help to cope with entrepreneurial challenges. Tourism destinations and politics can support hospitality entrepreneurs in these actions by creating conditions that foster social exchange in regional communities and trust in political and economic stability. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

However, in order to achieve successful investment and results, it is imperative to understand the level of current commitment to energy actions. Therefore, this paper investigates the level of engagement in energy efficiency measures of a sample of 50 higher education institutions from round the world, and identifies which types of renewable energy are being used to date. Results show that in more than half of the universities only a small portion of energy consumption comes from renewable sources (1%–20%) and solar/photovoltaics is the most used source (70%). Investment in energy efficiency is more common in the sample, with 54% of the universities reporting higher levels of engagement, mainly in buildings (78%) and equipment/machineries (56%).

MFA can be an essential tool in providing necessary data inputs for decisions related to the development of CE. Data-poor environments in developing economies, however, e.g. lack of data on physical flows in manufacturing, pose challenges to doing MFA. Other data however, in particular trade statistics accounting for shipment mass, are often available. We undertake a case study to characterize plastic flows in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) for 2016, demonstrating how leveraging such data enables MFA. A notable result from the MFA is that much (48%) of the landfilled plastic in T&T comes from plastic packaging for imported products rather than intentional domestic use. This is an example of what is probably a typical CE challenge for island nations: Importing materials with limited domestic demand at end-of-life. We use the MFA results to propose suggestions for a more circular flow of plastics in T&T. First, there is potential to divert plastic waste (including packaging plastic) for use as feedstock in a local cement plant. Second, the scale of PET plastic flows is of sufficient scale (26,000 metric tons annually) to make domestic recycle feasible. Techno-economic studies are needed to properly develop and evaluate these proposals, the role of the MFA here is to identify promising directions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Developing economy; Material flow analysis; Plastic flows; Recycling","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Elastomers; Plastic flow; Plastic products; Polyethylene terephthalates; Recycling; Circular economy; Developing economies; Material flow analysis; Materials flow analysis; Plastic packaging; Strategic decisions; Techno-economic studies; Trinidad and Tobago; Plastic recycling; ethylene; petroleum; developing world; economic system; material flow analysis; plastic flow; plastic waste; recycling; biomass; economic development; feasibility study; flow measurement; government; industrial waste; landfill; material flow analysis; measurement accuracy; municipal solid waste; plastic waste; recycling; Trinidad and Tobago; Trinidad and Tobago",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071661974

Adopting the two-dimensional job demand stressors–outcome relationships framework and the cognitive-relational theory of stress, the current study interrogated the challenge (i.e. workload and time pressure)/ hindrance (i.e. role conflict and role ambiguity) stressors–creativity curvilinear relationships, and the buffering effects of within-person resources–dispositional mindfulness, and core self-evaluation. Using multi-sourced, cross-sectional data from employees in three airports in Ghana, the research findings showed creativity to have a U-shaped relationship with role ambiguity and role conflict, but with time pressure the relationship was an inverted U-shape. Employees’ workload showed a near-linear relationship with creativity, flattening at high levels of workload. Core self-evaluation displayed itself as an effective buffering component on role ambiguity–and time pressure–creativity relations but not role conflict and workload. Dispositional mindfulness interacted with role ambiguity, role conflict and time pressure–creativity relations, but not workload. To optimize employees’ creative performance, the study findings make a strong case for attending to individual-level factors necessary for stressors management. Further implications and recommendations are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","challenge and hindrance stressors; core self-evaluation and dispositional mindfulness; Employees’ creativity; job demand stressors; within-person resources","airport; cognition; management; workplace; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053427814

This paper was focused on the six typical factors potentially influencing the purchase behaviour of EVs in Beijing, China, namely vehicle price, vehicle usage, social influence, environmental awareness, purchase-related policies and usage-related policies. Specifically, this study used the data collected in a paper-based questionnaire survey in Beijing from September 2015 to March 2016, covering all of the 16 administrative regions, and tried to quantify the relative importance of the six factors, based on their weights (scores) given by participants. Furthermore, Multinomial Logit (MNL) models and Moran's I (a measure of global spatial autocorrelation) were used to analyse the weights of each factor from statistical and spatial perspectives, respectively. The results suggest that 1) vehicle price and usage tend to be more influential among the six factors, accounting for 32.3% and 28.1% of the importance; 2) Apart from the weight of social influence, the weights of the other five factors are closely associated with socio-demographic characteristics, such as individual income and the level of education; 3) people having similar attitudes towards vehicle usage (Moran's I = 0.10) and purchase restriction (Moran's I = 0.14) tend to live close to each other. This paper concludes with a discussion on applying the empirical findings in policy making and modelling of EV purchase behaviour. © 2018","Electric vehicle (EV); Influential factors; Multinomial logit (MNL) model; Purchase behaviour; Spatial analysis","Air quality; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Electric vehicles; Sales; Surveys; Urban transportation; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental awareness; Influential factors; Multinomial Logit; Questionnaire surveys; Socio-demographic characteristics; Spatial analysis; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058783619

Customers can learn from the inventory level and update their beliefs about the product. Thus, consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by the availability information. Based on a unique setting from Amazon lightning deals, which displays the percentage of inventory consumed in real time, we explore whether and how consumers learn from inventory availability information. Identifying the effect of learning on consumer decisions has been a notoriously difficult empirical question because of endogeneity concerns. We address this issue by running two randomized field experiments on Amazon in which we create exogenous shocks on the inventory availability information for a random subset of Amazon lightning deals. In addition, we track the dynamic purchasing behavior and inventory information for 23,665 lightning deals offered by Amazon and use their panel structure to further explore the relative effect of learning. We find evidence of consumers learning from inventory information: a decrease in product availability causally attracts more sales in the future; in particular, a 10% increase in past claims leads to a 2.08% increase in cart add-ins in the next hour. Moreover, we show that buyers use observable product characteristics to moderate their inferences when learning from others; a deep discount weakens the learning momentum, whereas a good product rating amplifies the learning momentum. © 2018 INFORMS.","Amazon; Field experiment; Flash sales; Inventory availability; Learning; Retail operations","Lightning; Purchasing; Sales; Amazon; Consumer purchasing behaviors; Field experiment; Inventory information; Learning; Product characteristics; Purchasing behaviors; Retail operations; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060269731

The conventional services build for web are primarily based on the pull technology, where the user actively engages with system to get the services. However, in IoT environment, the services are based on push-based, where information and value added services will be pushed towards the user. Unless, these push-based services are properly managed they would overwhelm the user with unnecessary information, thus, it will soon start annoying the user. In this paper, we propose a lightweight context-aware IoT service architecture namely LISA to support IoT push services in an efficient manner. In particular, LISA filter and forward the most important and relevant services to the users by understanding their context. To achieve its goals, LISA formulates a user model to resolve local decision making by using agents and available web services paradigm. The proposed user model describes the user in an abstract way by considering the context and profile information of the user. For evaluation, we simulate LISA by considering an IoT tourist guide system as a use case scenario, and we show the performance of the our user model concerning precision and recall metrics. The results of our preliminary experiments confirm that LISA successfully reduces the information provided to the user by selecting only the most relevant among those. The evaluation shows that LISA can extract services for a user by selecting from 15000 services with precision upto 0.3 and recall upto 0.8, and it can be further optimized by tuning the user-specific design settings. Additionally, our approach shows improvements in query processing time which also includes the query generation time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic query generator; Context-aware; Internet of things; Push-based services; Web services","Decision making; Web services; Websites; Automatic query generator; Context-Aware; Conventional services; Filter and forwards; Internet of Things (IOT); Local decision-making; Precision and recall; Push-based; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059315331

Our empirical results show that microblogging UGC (MUGC) is a significant predictor of box office revenue and has stronger predictive power than UGC on Douban! Movies (DUGC). In addition, we find that the volume of enterprise microblogs (i.e., MGC) predicts box office revenue directly and also indirectly via MUGC, andMUGCthus exerts a partial mediating effect on the predictive relationship between the volume of enterprise microblogs and box office revenue.

However, the expansion of medical tourism has potentially detrimental effects for the welfare of host countries. In particular, a decline in workers’ productivity could arise as a result of a reduction in public health care provision due to the expansion of the medical tourism sector. By addressing the crowding-out effect on labor productivity, this paper sheds light on the economic impacts of medical tourism on host countries. Our empirical analysis confirms that medical tourism, on average, has a positive effect on host economies’ output growth, particularly in non-OECD countries.

We develop a local preference hypothesis based on the delegated philanthropy and transaction-costs theories. Consistent with the hypothesis, local institutional ownership is negatively related to facility toxic release. The negative relation is stronger for local socially responsible investing (SRI) funds, local public pension funds, and local dedicated institutions. We also find that the relation is more negative in communities that prefer more stringent environmental policies and in communities of greater collective cohesiveness. Local institutional ownership, particularly local ownerships by SRI funds and public pension funds, is positively related to the probability that an ESG proposal is either introduced or withdrawn.

In many developing countries, collection is undertaken mainly by the informal sector. This is accompanied by various environmental, social, health and efficiency problems. Some top-down experiments to integrate informal collection into the waste resource recycling chain have proved unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in waste management are formulating a new collection model: intelligent collection. In China, there are dozens of emerging companies who are engaging in intelligent collection of recyclables. What are the intelligent collection cases in China? Do they have potential to integrate the informal collection into the waste recycling chain? To answer these questions, we selected and interviewed 15 Chinese intelligent collection companies to identify their organisational model and comparative advantages over informal collection. We found that intelligent collection companies in China operated in two forms: human-human interaction collection and human–machine interaction collection. Comparative advantages were found in organisation, trade, data accumulation, and profit making sources. These render them with a high potential to integrate informal collection. Intelligent collection in China is still at an early stage. Its potential for a sustainable business model needs to be further explored. Its application as a supplement to the Municipal Solid Waste collection system and as an exclusive collection for high value waste items under the Extended Producer Responsibility framework seems promising. © 2018","Informal collection; Intelligent collection; Internet and Communication Technologies (ICTs); Internet of Things (IoTs); Recycling; Waste management","Chains; Developing countries; Economics; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Sustainable development; Communication technologies; Comparative advantage; Extended producer responsibility; Human-human interactions; Internet of thing (IoTs); Organisational models; Solid waste collection; Sustainable business; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056168173

We find that the retailer's store openings resulted in an increase in online purchases fromsuch customers. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior and prospect theory, we propose two mechanisms to explain this complementary effect of store presence on online purchases by existing customers. These mechanisms are the store engagement effect- customers making higher online purchases because of higher engagement from store interactions-and the store return effect-reduced risk of online purchase because of the option of store returns. We provide direct empirical evidence of these mechanisms on customer-level data. We further show that these effects increase as customers' distances from the retailer's store reduce because of the store openings.

A Walking School Bus (WSB)is a relatively new and scarcely evaluated commuting mechanism that in theory provides a creative scheme capable of inspiring voluntary travel behaviour change for children and parents. Through a series of in-depth focus group sessions that were conducted in Bradford, UK this article explores the perceptions of parents that are ultimately the decision-makers about how their children go to school. This work improves the understanding of the different challenges and opportunities underpinning travel to school, in general, and WSBs, in particular, by identifying and discussing six thematic areas of critical importance that explain the decision-making behind potential WSB uptake. These are namely: logistics, safety, trust, health and wellbeing, emotional needs and educational opportunities. Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations about how WSB initiatives can become more effective and attractive mobility tools for local communities. © 2019 The Authors","Active transport; Sustainable mobility; Thematic analysis; Travel to school; Walking; Walking school bus","Behavioral research; Decision making; Active transport; School bus; Sustainable mobility; Thematic analysis; Travel to school; Walking; Buses; bus transport; commuting; decision making; perception; sustainability; travel behavior; walking; Bradford [England]; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065236304

However, whilst evidence supports the move towards offsite, its uptake has been lower than expected. Whilst the precise reasons for this seem to be influenced by a number of issues, including contextual drivers and market maturity; some project stakeholders also view offsite as carrying greater risks. The purpose of this paper is to report on the quality of information flow, in particular, the impact and influence of this on design risks in offsite construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: An existing design risk framework is used as the point of departure for this research. This is further expanded into a specific model for evaluating offsite construction projects design risks, the rubrics of which were informed by two case studies of offsite construction projects in Australia and the UK analysed with a process-tracing technique. Whilst these cases were geographically separated, the constructs were aligned to uncover fundamental design information requirements and concomitant risks associated with offsite. Findings: The findings of the research reported in this paper include the crucial information feeding into the design process emanating from the lifecycle of offsite construction projects, namely, design, offsite (manufacturing), handling and transporting, site works and installation and also occupancy. These are contextualised within the four categories, namely, client requirements, project requirements, regulation aspects and social aspects and the final outcomes were summarised into a holistic diagram. Originality/value: Given that the offsite construction has shifted the working paradigm into assigning a significant level of efforts and emphasis at the front end of the construction projects, the importance of its design process and hence design risks management has gone up significantly in construction projects delivered using this technique. This research and paper contributes significantly to the built environment domain by identifying the crucial aspects along the project lifecycle to be considered to minimise the potential occurrence of design risks and hence increasing the confidence of project stakeholders in adopting offsite construction techniques in their projects. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design management; Design risks; Offsite construction; Project management; Quality of information; Risk management","Design; Economic and social effects; Industrial research; Life cycle; Risk management; Social aspects; Construction approaches; Construction projects; Design management; Design/methodology/approach; Off-site construction; Point of departures; Project stakeholders; Quality of information; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062268723

The research in this paper employs the practice-based view along with the event study methodology to determine whether firms can enhance operational efficiency through adopting replicable management practices prescribed under the ISO 14001 standard. This research involved examining performance for both certified and non-certified firms in the UK and Ireland. Whilst ISO 14001 was shown to have a positive and prolonged effect on certified firms’ manufacturing cost efficiency, employee productivity, and return on assets, the sample firms’ operating cycle displayed evidence of diminishing returns in the long-run. This study advances upon previous ISO 14001 research studies by applying the event study methodology and measuring the effect of environmental management system adoption through utilising operating performance metrics rather than relying on subjective measures of firm performance. Moreover, this research is important as few firms actually quantify the benefits of the ISO 14001 standard. However, the findings come with the caveat of diminishing returns for some operating indicators emphasising that firms can become overly efficient to the detriment of the initial operating speed gains. © 2018",,"Efficiency; Environmental management systems; ISO Standards; Academic literature; Employee productivity; Environmental benefits; ISO-14001 standard; Management practices; Manufacturing cost; Operating performance; Operational efficiencies; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059313521

Based on data collected from 633 UK companies, this study shows that there is a positive link between the value, rarity and inimitability characteristics of information processing capability and competitive advantage, which is partially mediated by decision-making effectiveness. The findings contribute to the theoretical development of the RBV by developing a mediation model that looks inside the black box.

Our results show that when a product has medium or high dispersion in its consumers' true valuation distribution and the degree of information disclosure before facilitation is moderate, two parties might have opposing interests as to more information disclosure. Specifically, in the agency pricing model, the revenue sharing mechanism leads the supplier to benefit, but the retailer to suffer, from more information disclosure. In the wholesale model, potential misalignment of interests as to more information disclosure disappears if the demand is linear. Double marginalization absorbs influence of two parties' marginal cost discrepancy and eventually tunes the two parties' margin proportional to each other. If the demand is log-concave and derived from common valuation distributions such as normal or logistic distributions, misalignment reappears in the wholesale model, but interestingly, the retailer benefits and the supplier suffers from more disclosure, which is opposite to the misalignment result in the agency model under the same log-concave demand. Our results suggest that information disclosure facilitation has a different interplay with the revenue sharing mechanism in the agency model than with double marginalization in the wholesale model. © 2019, INFORMS.","Agency pricing; Double marginalization; Information disclosure; Revenue sharing; Supply chain contract","Alignment; Sales; Supply chains; Distribution channel; Double marginalization; High dispersion; Information disclosure; Logistic distributions; Revenue-sharing; Supply chain contracts; Wholesale pricing; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065388840

Circular economy (CE) strategies offer potential to close the loop on electronic products and materials, but often lack the future-oriented perspective needed to keep pace with this dynamic sector. The present study addresses this challenge by developing a logistic forecasting material flow model that can predict future resource and waste flows for products with abundant historic sales data (mature products) as well as for products that have just entered the market (emerging products). One of the key trends observed across current and legacy electronics is the steadily shrinking innovation cycle, where the time between a product's market entry and peak sales is decreasing over time. This trend, coupled with extensive historic and modern product sales data, was used to create adoption scenario forecasts for emerging products, like fitness trackers, smart thermostats, and drones. Findings show that these devices are likely to have rapid uptake in the market, but may be quickly replaced by subsequent product innovations. In contrast, waste flow forecasts for mature products like CRTs, desktops, monitors and flat panel TVs showed their declining contribution to the U.S. e-waste stream. This study contributes a modeling framework that can be used to inform CE strategies in electronics by identifying near term opportunities and risks in end-of-life management of products to extend product life and close the loop on key materials. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; E-waste policy; Electronic waste; Emerging technology; Industrial ecology; Logistic forecasting; Material flow analysis (MFA)","Commerce; Electronic Waste; Forecasting; Sales; Wastes; Circular economy; Emerging technologies; Industrial ecology; Logistic forecasting; Material flow analysis; Waste policy; Electronic equipment; electronic waste; forecasting method; industrial ecology; material flow analysis; recycling; waste management; waste technology; Article; drone; environmental impact; forecasting; policy; waste flow forecast; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072585917

Our study assesses the impact of ride-hailing platforms’ market entry on new car purchases in the presence of platform competition. Our data is a monthly panel data on new car registration plates from 2013 to 2015, during which two leading ride-hailing platforms (Didi Chuxing and Uber) rolled out their services across select cities in China. We find that, while the entry of a single ride-hailing platform led to a decline in new car purchases, platform competition mitigated the negative impacts of platform entries. Our explanation is that the two competing platforms may have provided subsidies to drivers such that more people purchased new cars in order to sign up as drivers. By leveraging brand heterogeneity, our analysis finds supporting evidence that platform competition has resulted in increased sales of those car brands that are commonly adopted by ride-hailing drivers. Our study contributes to the literature on pricing strategies and subsidy allocation for two-sided markets by providing empirical evidence from the ride-hailing market. It suggests that companies’ competitive strategies need to account for consumer expectations and learning in the presence of strong network effects. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","car market; car-riding platforms; causal inference; competitive strategies; consumer expectations; Didi Chuxing; ride-hailing; staggered difference-in-differences; synthetic control methodology; Uber","Commerce; Car markets; Causal inferences; Competitive strategy; Consumer expectations; Didi Chuxing; Difference-in-differences; ride-hailing; Synthetic control; Uber; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073529255

This paper responds to these challenges through systematic evaluation of the research and development process for the Acorn CCS project, a project designed to develop a scalable, full-chain CCS project on the north-east coast of the UK. Through assessment of Acorn's publicly-available outputs, we identify strategies which may help to enhance the viability of early-stage CCS projects. Initial capital costs can be minimised by infrastructure re-use, particularly pipelines, and by re-use of data describing the subsurface acquired during oil and gas exploration activity. Also, development of the project in separate stages of activity (e.g. different phases of infrastructure re-use and investment into new infrastructure) enables cost reduction for future build-out phases. Additionally, engagement of regional-level policy makers may help to build stakeholder support by situating CCS within regional decarbonisation narratives. We argue that these insights may be translated to general objectives for any CCS project sharing similar characteristics such as legacy infrastructure, industrial clusters and an involved stakeholder-base that is engaged with the fossil fuel industry. © 2019","Carbon capture and storage; Cost-reduction; Full-chain CCS; Infrastructure re-use; Just transition; Stakeholder engagement","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Fossil fuels; Investments; Petroleum prospecting; Full-chain CCS; Infrastructure re-use; Just transition; Oil and gas exploration; Research and development; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder supports; Systematic evaluation; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067396401

We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","board of directors; corporate governance; diversity; female directors; intergroup bias","Management; Planning; Board of directors; Corporate governance; diversity; female directors; intergroup bias; Pressure effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063400528

The paper attempts to resolve this conundrum by addressing two key research objectives: Firstly, we draw on Campbell's paradigm to develop a sustainable product purchase behaviour model by conceptualising and measuring behavioural difficulties in terms of behavioural inhibitors/promoters, which includes Past Purchase, Premium Pricing, and Product Availability and Product Variety barriers. Further to this, we establish the exact role of purchase behavioural inhibitors/promoters from the point of view of Campbell's paradigm. This is achieved through analyses of actual behaviour data consisting of loyalty card data in the UK with a sample size of 1.8 million customers and supermarket shopper till receipt data in the UK. Evidence from the study established the existence of a sustainable product purchase inhibitor and promoter typology, which are critical to sustainable food purchase behaviour, but their degree of influence differ significantly. Our study subsequently, validates the Campbell's paradigm theory since we were able to establish using the actual purchase behaviour data that indeed, the purchase inhibitors are what causes the so-called gap between claimed purchase behaviour and actual purchase behaviour. The study further highlights theoretical and managerial implications of the findings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude-behaviour gap; Campbell's paradigm; Purchase barrier/promoter typology; ustainable purchase behaviour","Commerce; Competition; Food supply; Sustainable development; Attitude-behaviour gap; Campbell; Managerial implications; Product availability; Research objectives; Sustainable food consumption; Sustainable products; ustainable purchase behaviour; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060942704

We explicitly differentiate between disruption periods and business as usual periods to decrease the model size and computational requirements by approximately 85% and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, the decrease in model complexity allows us to include the conditional value at risk in the objective function to incorporate the risk aversion of decisions makers.

To effectively harness these technologies, a new set of managerial decision-making capabilities as well as enhanced data governance disciplines will be required. In this research, we employ organisational information processing theory to explore the relationship of analytical capabilities, data quality, reporting quality, and real-time data capabilities on supply chain performance.

And yet, the various interpretations of the concept of sustainable development and the questions it raises about economic growth make its implementation difficult. Higher education institutions may help to overcome these difficulties by developing new processes of change. However, to achieve this they need to integrate sustainable development in all their areas of activity. The aim of this paper was to develop new insights into organisational change processes in universities relating to sustainable development. Contributing to this aim, this paper reports on a case study of United Kingdom higher education drawing on findings and conclusions from a survey of their policy frameworks relating to sustainable development. The method comprised a critical policy analysis in order to identify, differentiate and categorise stakeholder interactions. The data generated comprised the range of higher education stakeholders and the network of interactions that they formed. Theoretical insights from social network analysis, stakeholder theory and the normative business model were used to find opportunities to address the difficulties in the implementation of sustainable development. Results suggested that the existing networks identified in the policy frameworks may not support the effective integration of sustainable development in higher education. Low-density of the national networks; the lack of a clear governance vocabulary for national policy frameworks; and the lack of explicit funding flows between organisations all pose problems for organisational change towards sustainable development in higher education. © 2018 The Authors","Higher education; Institutionalisation processes; Network density; Stakeholder participation; Sustainable development; UK policy","Economics; Planning; Sustainable development; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Institutionalisation; National policy framework; Network density; Organisational change; Stakeholder participation; Stakeholder theory; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056151979

In general, the annual PM10 concentrations in China have witnessed a steady decline in recent years; however, several regions still face relatively high levels of PM10 concentrations. Based on panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2003 to 2014, this study empirically investigates the spatial features and the influential socioeconomic factors of province-level PM10 concentrations in China using Moran's I index and spatial analysis approaches, namely, the spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM). The results indicate that, first, significant positive spatial autocorrelation and clustering characteristics appear in China's province-level PM10 concentrations. Second, according to analysis of the spatial panel models, the squared term of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the urbanisation level, the industrial structure, the energy consumption structure, the population density and the vehicle population have significantly positive effects on PM10 concentrations whereas the per capita GDP and environmental governance investment exert a negative effect on PM10 concentrations. Finally, all variables have a significant effect on the PM10 concentrations of both own province and neighbouring provinces (except for industrial structure), indicating a strong spatial spillover effect. As a result, a series of measures is put forward to tackle China's PM10 pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; PM10 concentrations; Socioeconomic influential factors; Spatial panel models","Diseases; Economics; Energy utilization; Factor analysis; Investments; Light modulators; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Population statistics; China; Energy consumption structure; Environmental governances; Influential factors; Panel model; PM10 concentration; Respirable suspended particles; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial variables measurement; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; econometrics; environmental factor; governance approach; Gross Domestic Product; health impact; morbidity; mortality; panel data; particulate matter; pollution effect; respiratory disease; socioeconomic conditions; spatial analysis; spillover effect; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053399222

Waste disposal charging scheme is an effective tool in fostering waste reduction and minimising environmental burden. However, the determination of waste disposal charging fee was mostly designed for cost recovery at present rather than meeting the future needs. This study develops a generic system structure for determining an optimum waste disposal charging fee for sustainable development and elaborates dynamic relationships between social/economic factors and waste disposal charging fee. A comprehensive system dynamics model was constructed to predict the optimum waste disposal charging fee by integrating quantitative and qualitative factors from the literature and questionnaire survey, which was then validated with the historical data in Hong Kong. The use of this model assesses and projects the structure, interactions of the complex system in waste disposal charges in an integrated and holistic manner. Two sets of policy scenario analysis were conducted for evaluating the effects of the newly modified waste disposal charging fee implemented by the Hong Kong government and identifying an optimum range of waste disposal charging fee. The simulation results indicated that the newly modified waste disposal charging fee is ineffective to achieve construction and demolition waste reduction in the long term. To devise policy strategy for sustainable waste reduction, the optimum increment percentage on original landfill and public fill charging fees should not exceed 250% and 400%, respectively.

Different from other business modes, customers in sharing economy systems are usually price sensitive. Therefore, it is possible to shift the usage of shared EVs through a well-designed Dynamic Pricing Scheme (DPS), with the objective of maximizing the system operator's total profit. In this study, we propose a novel DPS for a large-scale EV-sharing network to address the EV unbalancing issue and satisfy the vehicle-grid-integration (VGI) service based on accurate station-level demand prediction. The proposed DPS is formulated as a complex optimization problem, which includes two Price Adjustment Level (PAL) decision variables for every origin-destination pair of stations.

For aligned decisions at all levels, supporting forecasts must be ‘coherent’ that is they should add up appropriately, across relevant demarcations (e.g., geographical divisions or market segments) and also across time. We propose an approach for generating coherent forecasts across both cross-sections and planning horizons for Australia. This results in significant improvements in forecast accuracy with substantial decision making benefits.

In this study we explore the online review integration strategy for a pure offline retailer that takes the initiative to integrate selective online consumer reviews (OCR)from its competing online rival retailer into its in-store sales under two online selling formats. When the online retailer uses the reselling format, we find that the online review integration strategy is viable if the selected OCR are more informative than the offline retailer's in-store information services. However, when the online retailer uses the agency selling format, counter-intuitively, the offline retailer can adopt the same strategy even when the OCR are less informative than the in-store services if the spillover effect is negative, and the travel cost and the unit misfit cost are relatively small. In each case, we find that the offline retailer's review integration strategy mitigates market competition under some conditions, so benefitting the online retailer and/or the manufacturer as well. In the extension, we consider the context in which the offline retailer utilizes third-party reviews (TPR). We find that the offline retailer is willing to adopt TPR as long as its product is recommended by the TPR (under the TPR-only strategy), and it is also beneficial to integrate OCR and TPR simultaneously (under the OCR-TPR strategy). In addition, we compare all the feasible strategies and find that the OCR-TPR strategy is the optimal strategy most of the time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Game theory; Information integration; Omni-channel retailing; Online reviews; Online selling format; Spillover effect","Competition; Electronic commerce; Game theory; Information services; Integration; Information integration; Omni-channel retailing; On-line Selling; Online reviews; Spillover effects; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065830928

Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the potential of SCF resulting in improving cash-flow management and obtaining loan opportunities for suppliers and buyers, little is known about whether SCF initiatives can result in positive market value for service providers. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of SCF initiatives with the distinctive characteristics (that is, firm characteristic, collaborative mechanism, and service type)on service providers’ market value. We adopted the event study methodology to analyse 177 SCF initiatives announced between 2008 and 2018 (Quarter 1)in the Chinese market. The event study results showed that the average abnormal returns over a three-day event window around the SCF announcements are 0.793%, representing an average increase of CNY 1.66 billion in market value for the service providers. Moreover, we found that such increase in market value is significantly higher when the SCF initiatives are announced by non-bank investors (e.g., fintechs), when the service providers collaborate to provide SCF services, and when the service providers upgrade existing SCF services rather than introduce new SCF services. As the market value of an SCF announcement is evaluated with several essential characteristics examined to understand which types of service providers and initiatives are considered to be the most valuable service offerings, this study offers important insights to SCF practitioners and supply chain stakeholders. © 2019","China; Event study; Financial service providers; Stock market reaction; Supply chain finance","Commerce; Supply chains; China; Event studies; Financial service; Market reactions; Supply chain finances; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065840830

This pressing issue is only getting worse and is in need of relief. In this work, we consider the potential of a relatively recent, and rapidly growing, phenomenon to mitigate the problem: online crowdfunding for medical expenses, wherein patients reach out to their social network for monetary support via online platforms that facilitate the process. On the surface, medical crowdfunding holds the potential to address insurance gaps and to help those burdened by medical debt. However, recent questions have arisen in the healthcare literature around fairness and equity in the distribution of funds. Consistent with the notion of digital divide, many have raised concerns that the individuals most likely to benefit from these services are not the individuals who are most in need. Accordingly, we first seek to establish the effect of this novel phenomenon on a key indicator of financial distress: rates of personal bankruptcy. We then explore heterogeneity in patterns of funding solicitation and acquisition, to assess the presence inequalities across patient populations. We leverage proprietary data from a large medical crowdfunding platform based in the United States, which we combine with county records of personal bankruptcy filings. We report evidence that greater success amongst medical crowdfunding campaigns does translate into a reduction in personal bankruptcy filings. Subsequently, we report analyses which revealed evidence consistent with the presence of a digital divide. Specifically, we report evidence that disadvantaged groups are systematically more likely to launch medical crowdfunding campaigns, yet conditional on campaign launch, garner systematically less in funding. We discuss the implications for the literature on the digital divide, as well as implications for practice and policy. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

In the model, the degrees of environmental pollution and customer satisfaction are described as interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Then a method considering the optimistic-pessimistic attitude of decision makers is introduced to get solutions. For case study, the proposed DEA model is used to evaluate 20 SSCs, and analysis from time and stage perspectives are conducted to show the detailed performance. According to the results, the evaluated SSCs can be divided into four groups with different patterns, the weakness stage and period for each SSC can also be identified. The comparison and sensitivity analysis demonstrates our proposed model has more discriminating power and the ability of providing more managerial insights. Not only the sensitivity degree of a SSC to the attitude change of decision makers can be determined, but also the important indicator in different aspects for each SSC can be pointed out. © 2019","Double frontiers; Dynamic network DEA; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Sustainable supply chain","Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Manufacture; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Discriminating power; Double frontiers; Dynamic network; Environmental pollutions; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Production frontier; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069577669

Eco-innovation can aid freight transport firms through fostering sustainable transportation alternatives at best possible costs to ensure effective decision- making for freight logistics sustainability. Yet, freight logistics companies are faced with numerous difficulties when attempting to implement eco-innovation practices along their supply chains. This paper therefore identifies the challenges to implementing eco-innovation practices for freight logistics sustainability to aid management to take informed decisions to overcome these challenges before the environmental burdens become critical. The Best- Worst method is adopted to evaluate and rank these challenges in terms of their relative importance in Nigeria, an emerging economy, which is characterized by increased consumption due to huge population size coupled with government green requirements. The results depict that unavailable funds, lack of clarity on the financial benefits of eco-innovation practices, poor technology infrastructure and reluctant attitude towards eco-innovation practices are the most pressing challenges amongst the challenges faced by Nigeria freight logistics companies. These results will provide insight and guidelines for decision-makers and policymakers in the freight logistics sector who seeks to integrate eco-innovation initiatives to achieve sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-innovation; Economic prosperity; Freight transportation; Nigeria; Social welfare; Sustainability","Decision making; Population statistics; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Eco-innovation; Economic prosperity; Emerging economies; Environmental burdens; Nigeria; Social welfare; Sustainable transportation; Technology infrastructure; Freight transportation; decision making; freight transport; guideline; innovation; sustainability; technology adoption; transportation policy; welfare provision; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071979453

While we understand some of the transactional and relational attributes at stake for firms to leverage engagement with external stakeholders, we do not yet fully understand all the underlying mechanisms that are conducive to greater SOI outputs. At the same time, stakeholder theory emphasizes the importance of such engagement for firms’ financial performance (FP), even though the related findings are far from conclusive. Therefore, this paper suggests and tests a mediation model to investigate the associations between SE, SOI and FP. Based on data collected from 101 mineral companies in Norway, the results show that both transactional and relational interactions are important for improving SOI outputs, and that SOI fully mediates the association between SE and FP (measured by profitability). This suggests that external engagement activities do not directly link to FP, and that the financial benefit begins to appear once a firm is able to transform the acquired knowledge from external stakeholders into innovative outputs. Such open innovation approach thus requires a sustainability orientation to ultimately materialize into a performance benefit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mediator; Open innovation; Profitability; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability","Association reactions; Profitability; External knowledge; External stakeholders; Financial benefits; Financial performance; Mediator; Open innovation; Performance benefits; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064168108

The retailer observes this choice, and the objective is to dynamically learn the model parameters while optimizing cumulative revenues over a selling horizon of length T. We refer to this exploration-exploitation formulation as the MNL-Bandit problem. Existing methods for this problem follow an explore-then-exploit approach, which estimates parameters to a desired accuracy and then, treating these estimates as if they are the correct parameter values, offers the optimal assortment based on these estimates. These approaches require certain a priori knowledge of ""separability,"" determined by the true parameters of the underlying MNL model, and this in turn is critical in determining the length of the exploration period. (Separability refers to the distinguishability of the true optimal assortment from the other suboptimal alternatives.) In this paper, we give an efficient algorithm that simultaneously explores and exploits, without a priori knowledge of any problemparameters.

Although ACAP was globally introduced decades ago, researchers from Central and Eastern Europe have since underestimated its importance. The research objective of this paper is to answer the following questions: how does the level of ACAP influence the performances of technology-driven firms, and how does it catalyse their innovation outputs? Furthermore, we argue that exporting technology-driven firms possess even higher levels of ACAP than those who are weak or not-at-all exporters. ACAP measured value is examined alongside the innovation outputs of firms and their business performance, with an extended focus on exporters. A selected population of >600 Croatian firms were asked to fill in the questionnaire. Out of the 103 firms that completed the survey, 45 were recognized as intensive technology development performers, and 34 were identified as large exporters. Both populations were tested against formulated hypotheses, ultimately proving that higher levels of ACAP can be seen to positively drive innovation performance which, notably, can be seen most clearly with exporters. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"Competition; Absorptive capacity; Business performance; Central and Eastern Europe; Competitive advantage; Innovation performance; Measured values; Research objectives; Technology development; Surveys; firm ownership; innovation; performance assessment; technological development; technology adoption; technology policy; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052822247

The focus is on the Spanish economy in which monthly tourist arrivals data from 1998 to 2017 were collected for five key origin countries and around the world. To capture expected macroeconomic conditions, the Spanish term structure of interest rates is used. The results suggest that the tourism-expected economic growth relationship is time varying without any country-specific differences in the behaviour of the correlations. Importantly, positive correlations reportedly coincides with a regime shift in the Spanish economy; whereas negative correlations are evident when expected economic conditions are stable. It is also shown that the aforementioned relationship is influenced by key geopolitical and economic events (the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Global Financial Crisis and the ECB's quantitative easing programme).

The term is used to describe housing vacancy associated with overdevelopment and can refer to small communities, neighborhoods, or even whole cities that lie vacant. Ghost Cities are particularly prevalent in China where housing vacancy has become a serious concern for many second and third-tier cities. Measuring the extent of these vacant areas has been challenging due to Chinese data restrictions. This research tests whether it is possible to collect data, scraped from Chinese social media open access API's including Dianping (Chinese Yelp), Amap (Chinese MapQuest), Fang (Chinese Zillow), and Baidu (Chinese Google Maps) to develop a computational model to identify areas considered to be Ghost Cities. The model created for this study is based on the idea that thriving communities need access to basic amenities. Therefore Hansen's gravitational model was applied to give an “amenities score” for residential locations based on their accessibility to restaurants, banks, grocery stores, beauty salons, KTV, medical facilities, schools, and malls Moran's I spatial autocorrelation was applied to the amenity scores below the mean to determine spatially clustered residential locations with low scores. The results were considered potential Ghost Cities and were visited in Chengdu and Shenyang to confirm the accuracy of the model. These site visits showed that the model identified transitional, underperforming, or vacant housing in these cities, illustrating that it is possible to use data scraped from social media to identify underused residential developments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Amenities; China; Ghost cities; Social media; Spatial analysis; Urban development","amenity; autocorrelation; neighborhood; numerical model; social media; spatial analysis; urban area; urban development; urban housing; Chengdu; China; Liaoning; Ordos; Shenyang; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068142835

While traveling on the road, more and more people will choose to ride shared bicycle at home and abroad. When using shared bikes, we also face to problems and challenges. As a result of the shared-bikes renting/returning at different stations in different periods are imbalanced, the bike-sharing system needs to be updated frequently. This is the motivation for our study of bike-sharing traffic prediction. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical prediction model that predicts the number of rents/returns to each cluster in a future period to achieve redistribution. Firstly, we propose a two-level Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to divide bike stations into groups where migration trends of bikes among stations as well as geographical locations information are considered. Secondly, we employ a gradient boosting regression tree to predict the entire traffic rents. Thirdly, we use a multi-similarity-based inference model to forecast the check-out proportion and inter-cluster transition. Based on the above, finally the rents/returns of bikes to each cluster are deduced. In order to verify the effectiveness of our hierarchical prediction model, we validate it on the bike-sharing system of New York City (NYC)and Washington D.C. (D.C.)respectively, and compare the results with those of other popular methods obtained. We prove that our method is robust. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority over other methods.

Shared leadership to support diffusion of innovation may offer a panacea for the challenge. Our study shows how changing configurations of shared leadership support diffusion and adaptation of innovation. Managers remain important actors for the mandate and resourcing of innovation but, over time, powerful professionals, specifically doctors, come to the fore, to engage their peers and influence resource allocation. Nurses complement doctors’ leadership efforts around engagement of frontline professionals and in adapting innovation to local context. Significant contingencies in shaping shared leadership for diffusion and adaptation of innovation are: organizational financial performance; whether nurses enact hybrid leadership roles; and whether organization is hierarchical or collaborative. Theoretically, by focusing upon leadership configuration in the process of diffusion of innovation, our study renders visible practices of shared leadership, interdependency of hierarchical managerial or professional influence, its effect upon innovation diffusion, and contingencies that underpin this. © The Author(s) 2018.","healthcare organizations; innovation; leadership; management; public management","article; health care organization; human; leadership; manager; mass communication; nurse; resource allocation; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059704526

This paper attempts to formalise the decision aiding process in two real interventions dealing with alternatives’ generation for territorial policy making in Italy.

It demonstrates ways in which novelty in decision processes can be supported by Operational Research/Multicriteria Decision Aiding tools. The two case studies are used to answer the following questions: (i) Why have new alternatives arose during the policy making process? (ii) How have they been generated? (iii) Which consequences did they lead to? and (iv) What generated novelty in the process? The results highlight two main reasons that can expand the solution space within a decision aiding process: (i) dissatisfaction (of the client, of the analyst or of the relevant stakeholders, especially when dealing with public policies) with respect to the solutions currently proposed to the decision making problem and (ii) opportunity for a change in one of the variables/constraints. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","(D) Decision processes; Decision analysis; Policy analytics; Policy design","Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Decision aiding; Decision process; Decision-making problem; Operational research; Policy design; Policy making; Solution space; Theory and practice; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054516583

The emerging concepts of “Blue Growth” and “Blue Economy” have put the development of new marine industries on the political agenda. As marine industries expand, spatial interconnections and industry boundaries are being drawn and the potential for the combined use of marine space is being explored. The aim of this paper is to provide a single source document that summarizes the probable boundaries of marine growth industries, namely aquaculture; offshore wind energy with fixed foundations; floating offshore wind energy; tidal and wave energy; marine biotechnology, seabed mining; and tourism and recreation, based on depth and distance from the shore. This is an important first step in developing a single source document for marine industry boundaries that will help marine spatial planners and researchers develop innovative industry combinations to foster growth in the marine sector. This paper explores marine industry overlaps in four basins: European Atlantic, Baltic/North Sea, Mediterranean/Black Sea and the Caribbean/ Gulf of Mexico. By describing the geographical characteristics of different sea basins, this paper helps to focus marine governance strategies for stimulating combinations of marine industries towards the most promising areas.

To address this gap, an economic and environmental analysis of e-fuel production in Germany using renewable wind energy, different electrolysis technologies, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in 2015 and 2030 was performed. For current alkaline electrolysis and future solid oxide co-electrolysis using wind energy for electrolysis, e-fuel production costs and life cycle emissions were estimated to be 4.97 €/leq diesel and 64.07 gCO2-eq/MJ in 2015, and 3.24 €/leq diesel and 6.63 gCO2-eq/MJ in 2030. The critical parameters determining e-fuel cost are electricity cost, carbon dioxide (CO2) cost, electrolysis investment cost, and capacity utilization. Using optimistic estimates for all these parameters gives a production cost of 1.17 €/leq diesel (3.12 € ct/MJ). Abatement costs in the range 544–6424 €/tCO2-eq were estimated for e-fuels; much higher than those for competing vehicle-fuel technology options. While e-fuels are currently not a cost-effective method to reduce CO2 emissions they could be in the future if investment cost, capacity utilization, CO2 cost, and wind electricity cost can be improved by further research and development, or if fossil fuel prices increase substantially. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Electrolysis; Energy security; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental technology; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Investments; Life cycle; Wind power; Alkaline electrolysis; Cost-effective methods; Economic and environmental assessments; Economic effectiveness; Environmental analysis; Renewable electricity; Renewable wind energy; Research and development; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054316059

Demand in each period is stochastic and price sensitive, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged. At the beginning of each period, the firm determines its selling price and inventory replenishment quantity with the objective of maximizing total profit, but it knows neither the average demand (as a function of price) nor the distribution of demand uncertainty a priori; hence, it has to make pricing and ordering decisions based on observed demand data. We propose a nonparametric, data-driven algorithm that learns about the demand on the fly and, concurrently, applies learned information tomake replenishment and pricing decisions. The algorithm integrates learning and action in a sense that the firm actively experiments on pricing and inventory levels to collect demand information with minimum profit loss. Besides convergence of optimal policies, we show that the regret of the algorithm, defined as the average profit loss compared with that of the optimal solution had the firm known the underlying demand information, vanishes at the fastest possible rate as the planning horizon increases. © 2019 INFORMS.","Asymptotic optimality; Demand learning; Dynamic pricing; Inventory control; Nonparametric estimation; Nonperishable products","Costs; Inventory control; Profitability; Sales; Stochastic systems; Asymptotic optimality; Demand learning; Dynamic pricing; Non-parametric estimations; Nonperishable products; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071475113

Better understanding of the determinants of SME innovation in such environments is important for the development of private sector in LDCs, because innovative SMEs are crucial for sustainable economic growth. Yet, determinants of SME innovation in LDCs have hardly been studied. Considering the potential relevance of internationalization for SME innovation in LDCs, as means of overcoming domestic environmental constraints, this paper investigates the influence of foreign technology licensing, exports and imports on SME innovation in LDCs. The study employs data from 1058 manufacturing SMEs from Sub-Saharan LDCs - Djibouti, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The findings suggest that foreign technology licensing is found to be positively and statistically associated with SME product and process innovations in Sub-Saharan LDCs. Findings are compared with those from developed economies in order to identify distinctive features. The implication is that SMEs in Sub-Saharan LDCs need to be supported by different policies compared to developed economies. The results also show that R&D, firm size, sectoral characteristics and access to finance are important determinants of SME innovation. © 2018","Innovation; Internationalization; Least developed countries (LDCs) and Sub-Saharan Africa; SMEs","Environmental technology; Democratic Republic of Congo; Environmental constraints; Internationalization; Least-developed countries; Small and medium-sized enterprise; SMEs; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainable economic growth; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047726633

This paper investigates the labour market impact of high-tech growth on low and mid-skilled workers, using data on UK local labour markets from 2009–2015. It shows that high-tech industries – either STEM-intensive ‘high-tech’ or digital economy – have a positive jobs multiplier, with each 10 new high-tech jobs creating around 7 local non-tradeable service jobs, around 6 of which go to low-skilled workers. Employment rates for mid-skilled workers do not increase, but they benefit from higher wages. Yet while low-skilled workers gain from higher employment rates, the jobs are often poorly paid service work, so average wages fall, particularly when increased housing costs are considered. © 2019 The Authors","Cities; High-technology; Inequality; Labour markets; Multipliers; Wages","Commerce; Frequency multiplying circuits; Investments; Population statistics; Wages; Cities; Considerable resources; Employment growth; High tech industry; High technology; High technology industries; Inequality; Labour market; Employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066851204

However, like prior advances in information technology, the ability of firms to exploit these opportunities depends on a variety of complementary human capital and organizational capabilities. We focus on whether analytics is more valuable in firms where innovation within a firm has decentralized groups of inventors or centralized ones. Our analysis draws on prior work measuring firm-analytics capability using detailed employee-level data and matches these data to metrics on intrafirm inventor networks that reveal whether a firm’s innovation structure is centralized or decentralized. In a panel of 1,864 publicly traded firms from the years 1988–2013, we find that firms with a decentralized innovation structure have a greater demand for analytics skills and receive greater productivity benefits from their analytics capabilities, consistent with a complementarity between analytics and decentralized innovation. We also find that analytics helps decentralized structures to create new combinations and reuse of existing technologies, consistent with the ability of analytics to link knowledge across diverse domains and to integrate external knowledge into the firm. Furthermore, the effect primarily comes from the analytics capabilities of the noninventor employees as opposed to inventors themselves.

The CVaR criterion is used to describe the risk-averse behavior of the farmer. We derive the optimal strategies of the supply chain and perform some sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the government subsidy and other factors. The results indicate that, as the subsidy increases, the farmer's total target production increases. Further analysis shows that the total production increase is mainly from the increased farm size, and the farmer's endeavor actually decreases. In addition, the results indicate that the profits of the supplier and the distributor both increase with respect to the subsidy. However, the impact of the subsidy on the farmer's profit depends on the farmer's degree of risk-averse. In particular, the impact of the subsidy to the farmer's profit tends to be positive for farmers with high degree of risk-averse, and the impact tends to be negative for those with low degree of risk-averse.

Yet, data limitations have hindered reliable estimations. Filling this gap, this study uses a large panel dataset on energy consumption for commercial buildings in Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona. By tracking building occupants’ monthly energy consumption before and after the building's certification as an Energy Star building, we provide new estimates of the environmental gains from private investment in green real estate. Results show that for occupants that occupy space in a certified building in both the pre-certification and post-certification periods, occupants in Energy Star buildings consume 8% less energy. This empirically robust estimate of potential benefit from green-certification provides a quantifiable benchmark against which green-promoting policies can be measured. We also document evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Energy savings differ by the building's initial certification points and the building's baseline energy consumption.

In contrast to previous studies, this study requires fixed-sum undesirable outputs. In addition, the common equilibrium efficient frontier is constructed by using different input/output multipliers (or weights) for each different decision making unit (DMU), while previous approaches which considered fixed-sum outputs assumed a common input/output multiplier for all DMUs.

Design/methodology/approach: Two surveys were used to collect data regarding buyers’ and sellers’ perceptions and transaction intentions at a typical C2C e-marketplace. Partial least squares was used to analyze the data. A complementary qualitative study was conducted to triangulate the results from the quantitative study. Findings: Institution-based trust (IBT) exerts a stronger influence on transaction intentions for buyers than for sellers. Sellers perceive a stronger impact of trust in intermediary (TII) than buyers on transaction intentions. The impacts of perceived risk in transactions are not different between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, IBT mediates the impacts of TII and perceived risk on transaction intentions for buyers. Research limitations/implications: The results indicate that the impacts of trust and risk on transaction intention in e-marketplaces do differ between buyers and sellers. This suggests a need to further investigate the buyer–seller difference in online transactions. Practical implications: Intermediaries need to focus on different types of trust-building mechanisms when attracting buyers and sellers to make transactions in the e-marketplace. Originality/value: C2C e-marketplaces cannot survive without participation from both buyers and sellers. Most prior research is conducted from the buyers’ perspective. This research sets a starting point for future research to further explore the differences between buyers’ and sellers’ behavior in C2C e-commerce environments. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buyers; Consumer-to-consumer; Risk; Sellers; Transaction intention; Trust","Commerce; Least squares approximations; Risks; Buyers; Consumer-to-consumer; Sellers; Transaction intention; Trust; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053062745

However, little attention has been paid to patients who are predicted to die. In this work, we consider survival prediction as a two-stage task, where the first stage is to predict whether the outcome is survival or not, and the second stage is to predict the remaining lifespan for patients whose predicted outcome is death. To this end, we propose a two-stage machine learning model to enhance cancer survival prediction. At the first stage, a tree-based imbalanced ensemble classification method is proposed for classification of the survivability of advanced-stage cancer patients. At the second stage, a selective ensemble regression method is proposed for survival time prediction, where a priori knowledge is adopted for feature selection and the mean proportion of error interval is proposed for selecting base learners. Extensive computational studies performed on colorectal cancer data from SEER database demonstrate that the proposed two-stage model can achieve a more accurate prediction compared to the one-stage regression model. The results show that the proposed classification approach can effectively handle the imbalanced survivability data, and the proposed regression method outperforms several state-of-the-art regression models. © 2018","Colorectal cancer; Ensemble learning; Semi-random regression tree; Survival prediction; Two-stage model","Diseases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Colorectal cancer; Ensemble learning; Regression trees; Survival prediction; Two stage model; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054095023

It has been touted as an environmentally friendly strategy as it encourages manufacturers to take more responsibility for their products. We study when servicization results in a win-win outcome where it can simultaneously increase a firm's profits and decrease its environmental impact compared with selling products. Academic/practical relevance: Whereas policy planners are interested in strategies that reduce environmental impact, firms are unlikely to embrace them if they are not profitable. Hence, understanding when servicization results in a win-win outcome is critical both for firms and for policy makers. Methodology: We construct a stylized gametheoretic model that takes into account several key dynamics not accounted for in prior literature. In particular, we allow the servicizing firm to tailor the service to consumers' needs, endogenize product durability choice, and also use an environmental impact metric that captures the low discretionary use nature of products. Results: For products that have a low use impact relative to their production and disposal impacts, servicization can be a win-win strategy only if the firm has sufficiently high operating efficiency. By contrast, for products that have a high use impact relative to their production and disposal impacts, servicization can be a win-win strategy only if the firm has sufficiently low operating efficiency and the consumer segments are adequately similar. Furthermore, servicization can improve consumer welfare and simultaneously improve profitability and environmental impact only for products with a low relative use impact. Managerial implications: Whether servicization leads to a win-win outcome cannot simply be determined by changes in product durability, as often argued. It critically depends on the firm's relative operating efficiency, environmental impact of product in its use phase relative to the production and disposal phases, and the similarity of consumer segments. Our results explicitly characterize these relations. © 2018 INFORMS.","Environmental impact; Product durability; Profitability; Servicization","Durability; Efficiency; Planning; Profitability; Environmental implications; Game-theoretic model; Managerial implications; Operating efficiency; Problem definition; Product durability; Servicization; Win-win strategies; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074544133

The strategic goals, knowledge sourcing practices, and innovation performance of 1257 Belgian firms are investigated. Results show that both social and economic strategic goals are associated with the use of external information sources, but only the pursuit of social goals inspires firms to engage in external collaboration. No evidence is found of an inherent conflict between social and economic strategic goals. Instead, the two types of goals are independent of each other, that is, an emphasis on social goals does not preclude an emphasis on economic goals and vice versa. Moreover, firms’ external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance benefit most when strongly held social goals align with strongly held economic goals. These findings offer new insight into the nature and the effects of goal multiplicity among commercial firms. They open up a new perspective on the potential positive effects of the joint pursuit of social and economic strategic goals instead of seeing them as inherently conflicting, as past research has typically done. We illustrate how social strategic goals can deliver unique benefits to a firm, independently of and in addition to economic strategic goals. Our findings also contribute to the open innovation literature by revealing strategic goals as a driver of firms’ knowledge sourcing practices. Our findings suggest that solely emphasizing economic goals may be one reason why firms struggle to implement open innovation practices and do not reap their full benefits. The practical implications of our research are discussed. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Commercial firms; External informations; External knowledge; Innovation performance; Knowledge-based views; Open innovation; Sourcing practices; Strategic goals; Knowledge based systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074187110

There is also a growing literature that draws on this work to address leadership concerns and practices, but whose authors are experienced in leadership education rather than in the substantive scientific fields whose findings they report and interpret. We shall refer to this arena as complexity leadership. The initial burst of enthusiasm for complexity management and leadership in the 1990s, as a conceptual framework for informing organisational practice, has not been sustained at its early intensity. However, the field continues to attract interest. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a discussion of the validity and significance of these ideas for the leadership of organisations. We enable this through a review of the literature, a critique, and some recommendations. The type of questions which we will be raising are: (1) What failings in current leadership theory or practice are claimed to be corrected? (2) How novel, and how plausible, are the leadership prescriptions which are derived from complexity theory? (3) Does complexity theory provide scientific authority for these prescriptions? We find a paradox in the complexity leadership message which, on the one hand, claims to be rooted in complexity theory, but at the same time, rejects key denominators of the hard sciences. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to constructively handle the apparent paradox. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Analogy; Complexity; Leadership; Management; Metaphor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070663194

In this context, this paper aims to contribute to an emerging stream of research on drivers and challenges which higher education institutions and the extent to which they are endorsing sustainable procurement practices. The study is based on a survey of HEIs around the world, drawn from a network of sustainability practitioners and researchers at these institutions. Design of the survey drew on existing studies of barriers and enablers, the use of vignettes to provoke ideas among the research team, and a pilot study. Crucially, the study seeks to shed light on both drivers and critical barriers affecting the implementation of sustainable procurement at universities. The results and discussion identify previously unidentified barriers and enablers, and further suggest that smaller HEI have some catching up to do. Policy recommendations are presented and approaches on how to overcome barriers to sustainable procurement are set forth. These centre on the proposal that HEIs should consider developing a reflexive strategy to procurement purchasing policy, and to ensure there are suitable means for its implementation. © 2019","Environmental responsibility; Higher education institutions; Social responsibility; Sustainable development; Sustainable procurement","Driver training; Surveys; Environmental responsibility; Higher education institutions; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Policy recommendations; Procurement practices; Research teams; Social responsibilities; Sustainable procurement; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066989411

Buildings are capital-intensive, requiring considerable physical, economic, and societal investments. In order to amortize their environmental impact, buildings should be used for a period of time that maximises their utility. However, the average lifespan of a residential building in Japan is of only 25 years, a time that has been shortening since the World War II. Numerous Japanese houses are used for less than a generation before being demolished or abandoned, posing a risk for public health, decorum, and safety. This study presents a holistic view of the pressing societal and environmental concerns related to short-lived buildings, which can be used to identify sustainable strategies for the realization of a circular built environment in Japan. This study used a qualitative approach (i.e., media content analysis, field visits to local communities and citizens, expert interviews, and statistical validation) to identify the factors and path dependencies that have led to a low average building lifespan during the second half of the 20th century; moreover, the study investigated the stakeholders in favour of these short lifespans, their own motivations, and the rationale behind recent countermeasures initiated at the local to governmental levels. Numerous stakeholders were motivated by the economic costs or alternative post-materialist values, attitudes and aspirations, emotional attachment, or by a combination of these factors. Their decisions resulted from reflections and personal experiences of societal issues related to short-lived constructions in Japan. The article concludes that all residential buildings should be serving society and presents a framework for the identification of delayed, justified, or premature obsolescence. This framework can be used to decide whether the life of a residential building should be extended or ended. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Circular consumption; Lifespan; Obsolescence; Residential buildings; Stakeholders","Economics; Environmental impact; Health risks; Military operations; Obsolescence; Built environment; Circular consumption; Life span; Residential building; Stakeholders; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066867381

We find that teams whose members lack prior ties to others at the bootcamp experience peer effects that influence the quality of their product prototypes. A 1-SD increase in the performance of proximate teams is related to a two-thirds SD improvement for a focal team. In contrast, we find that teams whose members have many prior ties interact less frequently with proximate peers, and thus their performance is unaffected by nearby teams. Our findings highlight how prior social connections, which are often a source of knowledge and influence, can limit new interactions and thus the ability of organizations to leverage peer effects to improve the performance of their members. Managerial Summary: Researchers and policymakers believe that accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps help entrepreneurial ecosystems spur innovation and drive startup growth. The effectiveness of these organizations, in large part, depends on the new social interactions fostered among colocated entrepreneurs. Yet, little evidence exists about the extent to which such interactions actually lead to spillovers. We ran a controlled experiment at a startup bootcamp to investigate when entrepreneurs were most affected by their colocated peers. Not everyone benefited. We found that entrepreneurs with many prior ties to others at the bootcamp made fewer new connections, especially to neighboring peers, and thus did not experience significant spillovers. In contrast, those without prior connections experienced the greatest spillovers because they interacted frequently with people on nearby colocated teams. Our findings highlight how organizations like incubators and bootcamps, designed to foster new connections, might sometimes just reinforce old networks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","accelerators and incubators; entrepreneurship; entrepreneurship training; field experiment; peer effects","Management; Planning; Controlled experiment; entrepreneurship; Field experiment; peer effects; Product prototype; Social connection; Social interactions; Team performance; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064630596

Most empirical studies of bike share demand have included analyses of station use while a limited number of studies have investigated member behavior. Moreover, a limitation of this research is that the most research designs have been cross-sectional and therefore unable to establish causality. To address this limitation, we employ a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference modeling approach using a six-year panel data set of members’ bike share trips from 2010 to 2015 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. This research design takes advantage of changes in the bike share network over time to establish treatment and control groups and test the significance of effects of changes in accessibility on the frequency of individual member's use of bike share. Improvements in accessibility are measured as a reduction in distance to stations resulting from placement of new stations or relocation of old stations. We find a significant negative impact of distance on the frequency of use and that the effects of increasing bike share accessibility are larger in areas with denser bike share services. Specifically, members for whom access improved (i.e., distance decreased) were significantly more likely to increase the frequency of use than members for whom access remained the same. Moreover, by developing different models, we show the effects of distance are heterogeneous and vary with different built environment contexts. Members who live in areas with higher population density and a higher percentage of retail land use tended to increase their bike share use more. Our results indicate that improvements in physical accessibility may not result in practically meaningful changes in the frequency of use in all cases and imply that multi-faceted strategies for increasing use may be needed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Annual members; Bike share user behavior; Difference in difference models; Natural experiment","Behavioral research; Land use; Population statistics; Annual members; Built environment; Difference-in-differences; Empirical studies; Frequency of use; Natural experiment; Population densities; User behaviors; Bicycles; accessibility; cycle transport; experimental design; experimental study; numerical model; population density; travel behavior; Minneapolis; Minnesota; Saint Paul; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059560471

The approach fits product life cycle (PLC) curves to historical customer order data, clusters the curves of similar products, and uses the representative curve of the new product’s cluster to generate its forecast. We propose three families of curves to fit the PLC: bass diffusion curves, polynomial curves, and simple piecewise-linear curves (triangles and trapezoids). Using a large data set of customer orders for 4,037,826 units of 170 Dell computer products sold over three and a half years, we compare goodness of fit and complexity for these families of curves. Fourth-order polynomial curves provide the best in-sample fit with piecewise-linear curves a close second. Using a trapezoidal fit, we find that the PLCs in our data have very short maturity stages; more than 20% have no maturity stage and are best fit by a triangle. The fitted PLC curves of similar products are clustered either by known product characteristics or by data-driven clustering. Our key empirical finding is that, for our large data set, data-driven clustering of simple triangles and trapezoids, which are simple to estimate and explain, perform best for forecasting. Our conservative out-of-sample forecast evaluation, using data-driven clustering of triangles and trapezoids, results in mean absolute errors approximately 2%–3% below Dell’s forecasts. We also apply our method to a second data set of a smaller company and find consistent results. © 2018 INFORMS","Data set; Empirical research; Forecasting; New product introduction","Curve fitting; Forecasting; Piecewise linear techniques; Polynomial approximation; Sales; Data set; Empirical research; Fourth order polynomial; Mean absolute error; New product introductions; Out-of-sample forecast; Product characteristics; Product life cycles; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068892558

Based on a big database, the CITI can be used to reflect the GSC behaviors of selected brand enterprises by tracking which brand enterprises choose the products of hundreds of thousands of polluting enterprises as raw materials. The results show that GSC behavior measured by the CITI has a significant positive impact on the business performance measured by both return on assets and return on main business. Using the Baidu index as an instrumental variable for the CITI and the two-stage least squares (2SLS)method, the causal relationship is still robust. Furthermore, we investigate the influence mechanism of the CITI on the business performance.

It highlights key determinants of the decision to engage in an artisanal business and the challenges that impact upon the growth of these activities. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a mix-method research approach to explore a rural setting where most respondents (81 per cent) combine farm and non-farm livelihood activities. Quantitatively, a multi-nominal regression is used to examine the determinants of diversified artisanal livelihoods. It modelled the differences between farming livelihoods that have not diversified, compared to those also involved in the artisanal activity or wage employment and the intensity of participation. Findings: The findings show that nearly half of artisanal businesses (45.4 per cent) comprise only the owners and no employee, while 54.6 per cent employ one to three workers. Also, some artisanal ventures were more gender-specific than the gender-neutral activities. Other observations were in age (most artisans were under the age of 46 years) and vocational training (most were self-trained followed by a third receiving training only in specific areas such as technical works, building and construction and general trading apprenticeships). Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a relatively small sample size of 306 business owners, which makes it difficult to generalise despite the persuasiveness of the observations made. Practical implications: First, the use of econometric methods enabled the development of valid data sets (and various descriptive statistical and logit regression) to analyse determinants of the decision to engage in artisanal work, and the intensity of participation. Second, the ambiguity in categorising artisanal activities is unravelled. The study characterises the local artisanal sector and examines the intensity of participation. Without these, targeted support would remain elusive for practical and policy interventions. Originality/value: Artisanal activities constitute a high proportion of small businesses in the study area – with more than half (54.2 per cent) of respondents being classified as artisans, yet it is an overlooked area of entrepreneurship. Highlighted here are both types of activities and challenges regarding better conceptualising the understanding of artisans and regarding this mostly unarticulated base of practice. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artisan entrepreneurship; Decision making; Family firms; Small business",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046538179

Clearly, inventory could increase sales: expanding inventory creates more choice (options, colors, etc.) and might signal a popular/desirable product. Or, inventory might encourage a consumer to continue her search (e.g., on the theory that she can return if nothing better is found), thereby decreasing sales (a scarcity effect). We seek to identify these effects in U.S. automobile sales. Our primary research challenge is the endogenous relationship between inventory and sales-e.g., dealers influence their inventory in anticipation of demand. Hence, our estimation strategy relies on weather shocks at upstream production facilities to create exogenous variation in downstream dealership inventory. We find that the impact of adding a vehicle of a particular model to a dealer's lot depends on which cars the dealer already has. If the added vehicle expands the available set of submodels (e.g., adding a four-door among a set that is exclusively two-door), then sales increase. But if the added vehicle is of the same submodel as an existing vehicle, then sales actually decrease. Hence, expanding variety across submodels should be the first priority when adding inventory-adding inventory within a submodel is actually detrimental. In fact, given how vehicles were allocated to dealerships in practice, we find that adding inventory actually lowered sales.

One source of risk is demand uncertainty. Demand forecasting and safety stock levels are employed to address this risk. Most previous work has focused on point demand forecasting, given that the forecast errors satisfy the typical normal i.i.d. assumption. However, the real demand for products is difficult to forecast accurately, which means that—at minimum—the i.i.d. assumption should be questioned. This work analyzes the effects of possible deviations from the i.i.d. assumption and proposes empirical methods based on kernel density estimation (non-parametric) and GARCH(1,1) models (parametric), among others, for computing the safety stock levels. The results suggest that for shorter lead times, the normality deviation is more important, and kernel density estimation is most suitable. By contrast, for longer lead times, GARCH models are more appropriate because the autocorrelation of the variance of the forecast errors is the most important deviation. In fact, even when no autocorrelation is present in the original demand, such autocorrelation can be present as a consequence of the overlapping process used to compute the lead time forecasts and the uncertainties arising in the estimation of the parameters of the forecasting model. Improvements are shown in terms of cycle service level, inventory investment and backorder volume. Simulations and real demand data from a manufacturer are used to illustrate our methodology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Forecasting; GARCH; Kernel density estimation; Prediction intervals; Risk; Safety stock; Supply chain; Volatility","article; error; forecasting; human; investment; prediction; simulation; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048809757

Such heterogeneity arises because of differences in medical conditions as well as the travel burden each patient faces to visit the clinic periodically. Given this heterogeneity, we compare the strategic behavior of revenue-maximizing and welfaremaximizing specialists and prove that the former will serve a smaller patient population, spend more time with the patients, and have shorter waiting times. We also analyze the impact of telemedicine technology on patient utility and the specialists' operating decisions. We consider both the case when specialists can freely set their own fee for service and the case when fees are set exogenously by a third-party payer. We prove that with the introduction of telemedicine, the specialists become more productive and the overall social welfare increases, although some patients, unexpectedly, will be worse off.

Although researchers maintain that green supply chain management can bring positive financial performance, to date they have ignored the moderating role of the social control mechanism, especially in the context of China. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study aims to contribute to the literature in this field by proposing social control as an effective mechanism to strengthen the impact of green supply chain management on firms' financial performance. Today, most empirical literature in the field of green supply chain management adopts the static view and overlooks the contextual factors. This study addresses the gap by investigating the green supply chain management in an environment characterized by frequently unavoidable disruptions, and the effectiveness of social control that accommodates this complexity and dynamism. By examining green supply chain management under conditions of environmental dynamism, this study contributes to the literature of interface of green supply chain and resilience. Using a sample of 185 Chinese manufacturers, the theoretical model is empirically verified. The research findings indicate that in a dynamic environment, the joint effect of social control and green supply chain management practices is positive and significant.

Customer demand is influenced by the convenience of pickup locations and days. We combine demographic and economic data, business location data, and the retailer’s historical sales and operations data to predict demand at potential locations. We introduce a novel procedure that combines machine learning and econometric techniques. First, we use a fixed effects regression to estimate spatial and temporal cannibalization effects. Then, we use a random forests algorithm to predict demand when a particular location operates in isolation. Based on the predicted demand and cannibalization effects, we solve the spatiotemporal integer program using a quadratic program relaxation to find the optimal pickup location configuration and schedule.

However, little research exists on the content characteristics and effects of sponsored OCRs. This paper examines the different characteristics and effects of sponsored and organic OCRs, and the mechanisms by which consumers recognize and process these two types of reviews, using mixed methods in two studies. The findings of a text mining analysis (Study 1) suggest that sponsored reviews provide more elaborate and evaluative content; however, they are perceived as less helpful than organic reviews. The findings of a randomized experiment (Study 2) suggest that sponsorship disclosure increases suspicions about the reviewer's ulterior motives and decreases consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions when a review is positive.

We argue that whether firms derive growth option value from their multinational investment is determined by the interaction between market uncertainty and firms' incremental investment strategy. We show evidence that multinational investment creates growth option value for firms operating affiliates in host countries with high market uncertainty. In such uncertain environments, however, incremental investment strategies—limiting the equity stake or the size of investment in affiliates, across all countries or within each country—prove critical to the value of growth options. Creating growth option value therefore requires an alignment of firms' incremental investment strategy to the uncertain country environments they confront. Managerial Summary: Managers have long recognized the importance of taking an incremental approach to strategy making, but evidence on whether and when strategic incrementalism is valuable to firms remains scarce. This study focuses on two ways Japanese multinational firms invest incrementally in the context of foreign expansion—by limiting the equity stake or the size of investment in their foreign affiliates—and analyzes when such incremental strategies create valuable growth options that translate into market value. We find that these strategies, whether implemented across all host countries or within each country, do create significant growth option value, provided that market uncertainty is high. The findings highlight the importance of aligning firms' incremental strategy to the environmental uncertainties they confront, in line with the core notion of “fit” in strategic management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","alignment; environmental uncertainty; incremental strategy; multinational investment; real options","Alignment; Commerce; Managers; Strategic planning; Environmental uncertainty; Growth option values; Incremental approach; Incremental investments; Incremental Strategy; Real Options; Strategic management; Uncertain environments; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055737474

In a national life-span sample from the United Kingdom (N = 926), we examined age differences in financial decisions, including performance measures of sunk cost and credit card repayment decisions, and self-report measures of money management and financial decision outcomes. Participants also completed four individual-differences characteristics that have been proposed as relevant to financial decision making, including two cognitive ones (numeracy and experience-based knowledge) and two noncognitive ones (negative emotions about financial decisions). First, we examined how age was related to the four financial decision-making measures and the four individual-differences characteristics. Older age was correlated to better scores on each of the four financial decision-making measures, more experience-based knowledge, less negative emotions about financial decisions, whereas numeracy and motivation were not significantly correlated with age. Second, we found that considering both the two cognitive and the two noncognitive individual-differences characteristics increased predictions of financial decision making, as compared with considering either alone. Third, we examined how these four individual-differences characteristics contributed to age differences in financial decision making.

This trend raised sustainable consumption issues because of inefficient and wasteful use of resources, especially in resource-rich countries with high purchasing power and subsidized tariffs offered to residents. It is also well-known that resources abundance tends to lower financial development and limit productivity growth and social development. On the other hand, there is a growing acceptance that supply-side policies need to be complemented by demand-side management to support sustainable cleaner production and remedy aforementioned adverse impacts. In this study, we present the results of an investigation on demand-side management (DSM) opportunities and a framework developed for Qatar as a representative of an emerging resource-rich countries and discuss implications for cleaner production. The rationale behind is that Qatar is a commodity-dependent developing country, who, during the last five years, has experienced a population growth of 35%, and an increase in electricity and water demand of 46% and 35%, respectively. Similarly, during the same period, the national vehicle fleet has grown by more than twofold. These figures have ranked Qatar at the top of the per-capita energy, carbon, and water consumption list in the world and increased environmental vulnerability and reduced climate resilience. To that end, the objectives of this study are to: (1) construct a DSM framework tailored to the needs of resource-rich country like Qatar from economic, social, environmental, and technical aspects; (2) present, analyze, and discuss the results of a survey that reveals the perceptions, attitudes, and responses of local residents towards the applicability of DSM policies; and (3) discuss methods and solutions to achieve cleaner energy consumption. The conducted survey covered electricity, water, and transportation sectors and showed that residents have low awareness about their consumption habits, but they have high willingness to reduce their consumption levels. In the last section, we present the survey results and discussions as a reference for policy-makers to promote the most promising DSM options in Qatar. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first survey-based study conducted in the Gulf Cooperation Council region where a significant portion of world's oil and natural gas resources are extracted. Therefore, the results could provide insights to other resource-rich countries with similar characteristics to devise more efficient policies for promoting welfare-enhancing and sustainable consumption behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Demand side management framework; Resource-rich countries; Survey; Sustainable consumption behaviors","Commerce; Demand side management; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Natural gas; Petroleum deposits; Pollution control; Population statistics; Productivity; Surveying; Surveys; Sustainable development; Cleaner production; Environmental resources; Environmental vulnerability; Financial development; Gulf Cooperation Council; Production and transportations; Resource-Rich; Sustainable consumption; Natural gas deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072155081

We argue and find that firms with more humble CEOs will have better market performance but not because they actually perform better but, rather, because they benefit from an expectation discount in the market. Specifically, we show that, all else equal, financial analysts announce lower earnings per share expectations for firms with more humble CEOs. This expectation discount sets the stage for those firms to meet or beat analysts' expectations resulting in improved market performance for firms with humble CEOs. We find support for our ideas with a sample of Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 CEOs, operationalizing CEO humility with a videometric technique. Managerial Summary: In this study, we investigate the effect of CEO humility on firm's market performance. We show that firms with more humble CEOs will outperform other firms in the market because financial analysts tend to set lower market expectations for firms with more humble CEOs increasing the probability that they will outperform those expectations.

The different approaches nested within this framework include methods that exploit information at all levels of the hierarchy as well as a novel method based on cross-validation. The methods are evaluated using real data from two wind farms in Crete and electric load in Boston. For these applications, optimal decisions related to grid operations and bidding strategies are based on coherent probabilistic forecasts of energy power.

It discusses the drivers of changes in global natural gas consumption and trade flows from 2008 to 2015 using the extended logarithmic mean Divisia index. The results show that differences in the natural gas supply and demand across countries or regions, as well as the distribution of energy between the domestic and international markets, can be better explained when natural gas trade movements are considered. By comparing the supply and consumption increment of natural gas, this study finds that only the energy intensity, economic growth, and demographic effects are consistent with each other. The changes in the impact of other effects mainly depend on storage variations and statistical errors. In addition, the primary drivers of the incremental changes in natural gas consumption vary in different countries. They include production scale, import scale, export scale, consumption structure proportion, energy intensity, economic growth, and population and balance effects. Finally, the consumption competitiveness of the liquefied natural gas significantly improved over the examined period. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Liquefied natural gas; Logarithmic mean Divisia index; Natural gas consumption; Natural gas trade flows; Pipeline natural gas","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Gas fuel purification; Gas supply; Gases; International trade; Liquefied natural gas; Population statistics; Consumption structure; Demographic effects; Divisia index; Incremental changes; International markets; Natural gas consumption; Statistical errors; Statistical reviews; Natural gas wells; competitiveness; energy use; export; global economy; import; liquefied natural gas; trade flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050652376

However, we know little about how such groups affect low-carbon consumption behavior (LCB), especially the impact of habitual low-carbon consumption behavior (HLCB). To expand on the previous research and encourage LCB from the perspective of reference groups, we conducted a social study of Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China (N = 351). We aim to test how the influences of reference groups act on the purchasing low-carbon consumption behavior (PLCB) and HLCB of residents. The results indicate that all of the influences work indirectly through low-carbon consumption intention (LCI). Among these influences, the informational influence and utilitarian influence positively promote LCI, while the value-expressive influence inhibits it. The intention engendered by reference groups has a significantly greater impact on residents' HLCB than on their PLCB, and it is more conducive to promoting a low-carbon lifestyle. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Low-carbon consumption; Multi-group analysis; Reference group; Structural equation model","consumption behavior; decision making; environmental economics; equation; lifestyle; numerical model; pollution tax; standard (reference); China; Jiangsu; Xuzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063365605

The manufacture of RDCs is typified by the extensive use of materials and energy, meaning that the development of a Circular Economy in this sector is particularly important. A number of behavioural barriers are preventing the development of the Circular Economy but an appropriate behaviour change intervention could help to overcome them. This paper investigates how effective the use of Persuasive Communication could be in influencing the Behavioural Attitudes, Product Perceptions and Behavioural Intentions towards the purchase of remanufactured RDCs. Participants in this study are engineers and academic experts of retail refrigeration equipment. The study was carried out in three consecutive stages. In the first stage participants completed a questionnaire, which assessed their Behavioural Attitudes, Product Perceptions and Behavioural Intentions. In the second stage participants were exposed to the intervention, which was the Persuasive Communication in the form of an audio-visual presentation. In the third stage participants completed a second questionnaire which assessed the impact of the intervention. The results show that the Persuasive Communication had a positive impact on the participants' Behavioural Attitudes, Product Perceptions and Behavioural Intentions towards the purchase of remanufactured RDCs. This paper demonstrates how effective this type of intervention could be, if developed further to create a target market and generate demand for remanufactured RDCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Behaviour change; Circular business models; Circular economy; Persuasive communication; Pro-circular behaviour; Remanufacture","Purchasing; Refrigeration; Surveys; Behaviour changes; Business models; Circular economy; Pro-circular behaviour; Remanufacture; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062834715

However, the precise role of how energy and environment contribute to economic growth in emerging economies is still unknown. This paper explores the sustainability of remarkable GDP growth in emerging economies by using non-radial directional distance function (NDDF) to identify the sustainable total-factor productivity (STFP) growth in the emerging economies and comparing it with that in developed economies. Our research extends previous literature by highlighting the roles of energy and environment in economic growth. The results raise the concerns on the sustainability of the remarkable GDP growth (especially after 2000) in emerging economies due to their slow STFP growth after excluding the contributions from energy and environment. Furthermore, it is also found that compared with developed economies, the slower STFP growth in emerging economies is mainly caused by their disadvantages in innovation, although they are able to utilize existing technology by catch-up effect. Besides, analysis from the group heterogeneity among Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America gives a better grasp of implications for stimulating the sustainable growth in emerging economies by promoting technology spillover from developed economies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Driving forces; Emerging economies; Remarkable growth; STFP","Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Development patterns; Directional distance function; Driving forces; Emerging economies; Energy and environment; STFP; Technology spillovers; Total factor productivity; Economics; economic growth; energy use; Gross Domestic Product; heterogeneity; innovation; spillover effect; sustainability; technological development; Article; carbon footprint; economic aspect; economic development; energy consumption; environmental factor; geographic distribution; gross national product; human; pollution; productivity; socioeconomics; sustainable growth; sustainable total factor productivity; technology; Asia; Eastern Europe; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063000595

The leading measure of pollution still remains only CO2 emission or, at best, CO2 equivalent emission. The few works taking a multi-criteria perspective are mainly related to specific case studies, urban areas, or the localization of renewable power plants. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria analysis for a macro-perspective assessment of 10 different pollutants in 30 European countries over the period 2008–2015. Methodologically, we propose a new hybrid tool allowing us to merge the consolidated procedure usually employed for environmental evaluation: PROMETHEE, with a more flexible weighing process inspired by Data Envelopment Analysis. The unprecedented use of this tool for developing a macro perspective allows the clustering of European countries according their relative performances without any exogenous assumption about the weights given to the specific pollutants. In addition, the empirical evidence emerging from the analysis provides a comprehensive picture of patterns followed by European economies, which highlights the relative strengths and flaws at country-level for the considered pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis; Environment; Pollutants; PROMETHEE; Sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Sustainable development; Environment; Environmental economics; Environmental evaluation; European Countries; Multi Criteria Analysis; Pollutants; PROMETHEE; Relative performance; Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062153581

Existing research using surveys or choice experiments in the lab environment may not be able to capture actual consumer behaviors and preferences. This study examines the effectiveness of ecolabels in informing sustainable consumption by using data collected from 156 participants in the naturalistic shopping environment using eye tracking glasses. Our results show that: 1) USDA Organic and NON GMO were the two most frequently identified ecolabels on the purchased products; 2) a majority of the participants (54%) did not evaluate any product information at all for any of the items they purchased, while only 10% of the products purchased from all participants were evaluated, which indicates that most of the products were purchased through habitual shopping; 3) consumers' revealed preferences of ecolabeled products (through purchase actions) were lower than the stated preferences (through survey or hypothetical choice experiments); and 4) competing with other product information, ecolabels received little attention and awareness from consumers. Potential ways to help improve the effectiveness of ecolabels in promoting sustainable consumption include: 1) educating consumers on the presence and meaning of ecolabels to help establish ecolabeled products as parts of the habitual shopping products; and 2) leveraging consumers’ attentions to other product information (e.g., price, nutrition table) to help increase the visibility of ecolabels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecolabel; Eye tracking; Naturalistic shopping behavior; Sustainable consumption; Visual attention","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Glass; Sales; Surveys; Sustainable development; Eco-labeled products; Ecolabels; Environmentally friendly products; Naturalistic decision makings; Revealed preference; Shopping behavior; Sustainable consumption; Visual Attention; Eye tracking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061596375

The requester is the primary caregiver responsible for managing the health of a population of patients. When a patient requires advanced care outside of the requester's expertise, the requester refers the patient to a provider and pays for the referral services. Treatment may succeed or fail, and in the case of failure, the requester incurs further follow-up costs. The requester may exert preventive effort to reduce the volume of referrals. The provider may exert nonreimbursable effort to reduce the chance of treatment failure. We analyze payment contracts between the two firms. We find that fee-for-service (FFS) induces neither system nor social optimum effort outcomes. However, a penalty contract can generally coordinate the effort decisions with either the system optimum or the social optimum. Furthermore, we find that patients may benefit from having a coordinating contract replace FFS. However, the types of procedures that make a coordinating contract most advantageous for the requester and provider are not necessarily the same as those that make the patients better off than under FFS.

The authors explore how the characteristics of entrepreneurship and grit can potentially impact employee loyalty to an organization. Methodology/approach: A content analysis using responses from 51 hiring managers and their views of the advantages and challenges of hiring from the millennial generation yielded patterns focused on grit, loyalty, and entrepreneurship. Findings: Based on the feedback from hiring managers using a grounded theory approach, we propose a conceptual model that includes three constructs that emerged from the analysis: individual entrepreneurship orientation, grit, and loyalty. The results from the content analysis suggest grit moderates the relationship between entrepreneurship and loyalty. The conceptual model proposes sales managers can hire individuals with grit to decreased employee turnover. Originality/value contribution: This study provides several contributions to the stream of research focused on Generation Z and employee loyalty. First, due to the changing demographic of the workforce, sales managers need to hire and retain younger sales professional that have different expectations; therefore, thinking differently of their hiring process. Second, the study creates an exploratory discussion that can help sales managers evaluate future talent for their organization. Sales managers may evaluate an applicant’s “grittiness” vs. those who are more entrepreneurial in spirit in order to retain those sales professionals long term. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","business marketing; entrepreneurship; Generation Z; grit; industrial marketing; millennials; Sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060650619

Much of the normative literature is conceptual in nature. Moreover, there is very limited research investigating the mediating role of employee affective commitment to change (IACC) between IRFCs and TQM. Therefore, this study proposes to fill this gap by providing empirical evidence leading to advancement in the understanding of direct and indirect influences of IRFC components on TQM implementation. To achieve this, a questionnaire-based survey was developed and self-administered to 226 middle managers in Algerian manufacturing organisations (AMOs) with a good rate of return of 52%. The analysis of the collected data revealed that two of the IRFC components, namely personally beneficial and change self-efficacy are the most supportive IRFC dimensions for TQM implementation. Furthermore, the results of this study show support for the mediating role of IACC in the relationship between IRFCs and TQM implementation. Therefore, this paper makes a novel contribution by providing a refined and deeper comprehension of the relationships between IRFCs and TQM implementation. © 2016","Change; Quality management; Readiness; TQM","Earnings; Manufacture; Surveys; Total quality management; Affective commitments; Change; Literature reviews; Manufacturing organisations; Quality improvement; Readiness; Readiness for change; TQM implementation; Quality management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025462398

However, CO2 emissions from airport operations have rarely been estimated and discussed. We investigate the main driving forces of airport CO2 emissions by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models, separately, to investigate whether urbanization drives airport CO2 emissions and to investigate spatial heterogeneity at the city level. Nighttime light (NTL) data from satellite observations are adopted as a proxy for urbanization. We obtained energy consumption data by end-use purpose for 70 airports in China and calculated the CO2 emissions from on-ground airport operations. The median CO2 emissions of the 70 sample airports are estimated to be 15.9 million tonnes for 2015. Results from the GWR model indicate that airport CO2 emissions are affected by five main factors: urbanization, foreign direct investment, the share of tertiary industry in gross domestic output, passenger turnover of civil aviation and passenger turnover of railways. The elasticity of urbanization shows an increasing trend from the east of China to the west. The spatial heterogeneity of the CO2 emissions of the five airport clusters that are located in five urban agglomerations is discussed. In order to achieve effective reductions of CO2 emissions from airports, policy-makers should consider the spatial heterogeneity of the major driving factors of carbon emissions in different regions to avoid carbon lock-in. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Airport CO2 emissions; China; Geographically weighted regression; Nighttime light data","Airports; Civil aviation; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Investments; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; CO2 emissions; Energy consumption datum; Foreign direct investments; Geographically weighted regression; Geographically weighted regression models; Night-time lights; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; airport; carbon emission; least squares method; nightglow; regression analysis; satellite data; spatial analysis; urbanization; airport; Article; aviation; carbon footprint; China; energy consumption; geographically weighted regression; gross national product; investment; mathematical model; night; railway; spatial analysis; telecommunication; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071118977

Such complexity and uncertainty requires future-oriented research that is effective in gathering experience across disciplines, sectors and scales. Scenario analysis is a proven method for decision support in conditions of uncertainty, shown to provide opportunities for learning that supports transformational change. There are, however, few scenario studies that examine the water-energy-food nexus. This paper presents a novel morphological method for developing and analysing transdisciplinary scenarios that cover the water-energy-food nexus. The method combines existing research to generate of a small suite of scenarios that are able to portray substantial complexity and multidimensionality, yet are fit for use within participatory research. The potential of this method to enhance nexus thinking is discussed, illustrating how it could provide a much-needed platform to support the transition towards sustainability across the nexus. By providing a platform for transdisciplinary dialogue, the scenarios disturb existing assumptions, reintroduce social and justice questions to the technical challenges that face the nexus, and build capacity for sustainable transformation. Further research is required to apply this approach so it can support tangible changes in decision making. © 2019","Participatory methods; Scenarios; Transdisciplinary methods; Transition management; Water-energy-food nexus","Decision making; Decision support systems; Sustainable development; Participatory methods; Scenarios; Transdisciplinary methods; Transition management; Water energy; Uncertainty analysis; decision making; energy budget; food security; participatory approach; research work; sustainable development; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070545218

Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies – the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure. © 2019 The Author(s)","Countermeasures; Debiasing; Decision-making; Knowledge absorption; Not-Invented-Here Syndrome; Open innovation","Decision theory; Knowledge management; Open Data; Radar countermeasures; De-biasing; External knowledge; Knowledge absorptions; Mixed-methods research; Not invented here syndromes; Open innovation; Organizational learning; Perspective taking; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068580237

It can help to build a low-carbon high-growth global economy and guarantee the global well-being of people. In this paper, three pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social, are considered and discussed to design a supply chain network. The proposed model tries to maximize profit primarily while capturing societal community development by prioritizing the less developed regions. Moreover, the model ensures that the environmentally friendly facilities can operate in the supply chain network while others have to be repaired. Furthermore, quantifying the benefits of transportation decisions in terms of both cost and environmental impact savings to improve the sustainability of logistics systems is considered. In addition, the model is regarded as robust programming for the problem to approximate real situations. The proposed model is implemented in some numerical examples and in a real case study. Numerical results and computational analysis are indicative of the significance of the model and through conducting the case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed model can be implemented successfully in practice and it would be beneficial to all the three pillars of sustainable development.

However, there is no strong evidence to validate their use in decision-making in the current literature. This paper reports on the design of two bounded rationality principle based simulation methods, and detailed experimental results that aim at providing evidence to answer the following two questions: (1) what are the conditions under which incomplete preference relations are better than complete preference relations?; and (2) can self-confident preference relations improve the quality of decisions? The experimental results show that when the decision-maker is of medium rational degree, incomplete preference relations with a degree of incompleteness between 20% and 40% outperform complete preference relations; otherwise, the opposite happens. Furthermore, in most cases the quality of the decision making improves when using self-confident preference relations instead of incomplete preference relations.

In addition, a significant positive relationship between socialization and political involvement positively impacts voting intentions. The study also examines the interaction effects of enculturation and acculturation orientations on the relationship between socialization and political involvement. The study's findings point to a positive moderating role of acculturation in this relationship but a negative one for enculturation. The study is the first to investigate simultaneously the drivers of socialization on social networking sites in the context of immigrant consumers and the impact of their socialization on political involvement and voting intention.

To enhance future research on agri-environmental program design and to increase the speed at which credible scientific knowledge is accumulated, we highlight methodological challenges, identify important gaps in the existing literature, and make key recommendations for both researchers and those evaluating research. We first report on four key methodological challenges—underpowered designs, multiple hypothesis testing, interpretation issues, and choosing appropriate econometric methods—and suggest strategies to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we emphasize the need for more detailed planning during the experimental design stage, including power analyses and publishing a pre-analysis plan. Greater use of replication studies and meta-analyses will also help address these challenges and strengthen the quality of the evidence base. In the second part of this paper, we discuss how insights from behavioral and experimental economics can be applied to improve the design of agri-environmental programs. We summarize key insights using the MINDSPACE framework, which categorizes nine behavioral effects that influence decision-making (messenger, incentives, norms, defaults, salience, priming, affect, commitment, and ego), and we highlight recent research that tests these effects in agri-environmental contexts. We also propose a framework for prioritizing policy-relevant research in this domain. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Behavioral insights; Conservation; Effect size; Environmental economics; Experimental design; Power analysis; Subject pools","Conservation; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Design of experiments; Behavioral insights; Effect size; Environmental economics; Power analysis; Subject pools; Statistics; agri-environmental policy; agricultural economics; agricultural land; behavioral response; conservation management; econometrics; environmental economics; experimental design; experimental study; literature review; meta-analysis; methodology; mitigation; prioritization; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064339312

A panel data gravity model was used to analyse bilateral tourist flows between 81 origin countries and 32 destination countries from 1995 to 2008. This model highlights cultural factors using the push and pull framework and explains their influence vis-a-vis self-image congruity theory, arousal theory, and cultural theory of risk. Results indicate that when controlling for the effects of distance, population, and GDP per capita, international tourists tend to flow out of countries with lower Power Distance, higher Individualism, lower Masculinity, higher Long-Term Orientation, and higher Indulgence. Countries with higher Individualism, lower Uncertainty Avoidance, and higher Indulgence tend to attract more international tourists. In the push and pull model, tourist source countries’ cultural values, such as low Power Distance, Individualism, Femininity, and Indulgence can be considered push factors in international travel, while destination countries’ cultural values of Individualism, Uncertainty Acceptance, and Indulgence act as pull factors. Self-image congruity theory is supported in the cultural dimension of Uncertainty Avoidance Index.

Using dyadic survey data, an analysis of new products launched by 122 consumer durable goods firms reveals that sales volume and profits of new products are associated with (1) social media communication in a positive but diminishing shape, and (2) online advertising in an inverted U-shape. Further analyses show that those curvilinear relationships are steeper for social media communication and flatter for online advertising at respective (1) higher levels of customer product involvement and (2) lower levels of product superiority.

However, it is not obvious why individuals recommend products in a community composed of non-transactional users. What are the critical factors influencing such a behavior? To attempt to provide insights into the product recommendation behavior in online social networking communities, we develop a model to investigate the effects of community atmospheric cues on affective social distance and subsequent product recommendations based on the stimulus–organism–response paradigm. By analyzing the results of a survey using a questionnaire, we found that community reciprocity and community receptivity have a direct influence on product recommendation, while community atmospheric cues have an indirect influence through affective social distance.

Environmental awareness is tested within the context of purchasing vehicles and, thus, vehicle relevant factors (perceived quality and self-image) are also included. Further, the purpose of this paper is to explain the relative contribution of general environmental awareness factors on purchasing intentions compared to quality and self-image. Design/methodology/approach: The main thrust of the research involved a survey of 248 young automobile buyers from a large public university in Texas, USA. The data were analyzed using both multiple regression and partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Environmental attitude has a positive impact on purchasing intention, while perceived control toward environmentally responsible behavior has a negative impact. Results also show a positive impact of quality and self-image on intention to purchase environmentally friendly cars. Furthermore, the results reveal that environmental awareness factors explain less variance than perceived quality. At the same time, the results show that environmental factors, relatively, explain more variance in the decision-making process than self-image. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the relationship between general environmental awareness and the intention to purchase an environmentally friendly car. This study contributes to sustainable consumption literature in operations management. The paper also provides insights for developing managerial guidelines for car manufacturers based on the understanding of factors influencing environmentally friendly car purchasing intentions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental awareness; Purchasing intention; Quality management; Theory of planned behaviour","Automobile manufacture; Behavioral research; Decision making; Least squares approximations; Quality management; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental attitudes; Environmental awareness; Environmentally friendly cars; Environmentally responsible; Partial least square (PLS); Structural equation modeling; Theory of planned behaviour; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053062805

It is also an important policy issue with regard to the overall implementation of China's supply-side structural reforms. In this study, we use the production function method as well as the panel variable coefficient model to calculate the 25 provinces' boundary production functions for the coal industry, which leads to the estimation of the coal capacity and capacity utilization rate of each province. Taking into account the labor resettlement cost and disposal cost of fixed assets, a total cost function of coal de-capacity is established. The growth rate function of total factor productivity (TFP) in the coal industry is constructed by the Solow residual value method. An allocation model of coal de-capacity is then proposed, based on multi-objective nonlinear optimization with constraint conditions on the total reduction amount and minimum output of coal in each region. Finally, using the relevant data of China's 25 coal-producing provinces in 1990–2015, the allocation of coal de-capacity is obtained under the goal of minimizing the total cost and maximizing the TFP growth rate. The results show that the capacity utilization rate of China's coal industry is much lower than the lower limit of the reasonable utilization ratio, while TFP shows negative growth over a long period. The comparative analytical results indicate that in terms of total cost, the optimal allocation scheme is 44.5335 billion yuan lower than the government allocation scheme. The disposal cost of fixed assets and labor resettlement costs decrease by 29.2749 billion yuan and 15.2586 billion yuan respectively. In terms of TFP growth, the optimal allocation scheme has a 1.54% higher TFP growth rate compared with the government allocation scheme. In terms of fairness, the Gini coefficients of the optimal scheme calculated by various indexes are all smaller than 0.3, placing the scheme within the category of considerable or absolute fairness. In addition, we calculate the optimal allocation ratio of coal de-capacity in the situation where cost preference and quality preference of central government are considered, to verify the intrinsic consistency of the model. In brief, the optimal allocation scheme proposed in this study effectively realizes the integration of economy, efficiency, and fairness. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coal industry; De-capacity; Multi-objective nonlinear optimization; Target allocation","Coal; Cost functions; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Capacity utilization rate; Constraint conditions; De-capacity; Government allocation; Non-linear optimization; Target allocations; Total factor productivity; Variable-coefficient models; Coal industry; coal; coal industry; cost-benefit analysis; economic analysis; industrial performance; industrial production; nonlinearity; optimization; policy implementation; resource allocation; targeting; total factor productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057040939

Because task demand is a major factor that influences how computerized systems are used to make decisions, identifying task demand automatically provides an opportunity for designing advanced decision support systems that can respond to user needs at a personalized level. A first step for designing such advanced decision tools is to investigate possibilities for developing automatic task load detectors. Grounded in decision making, eye tracking, and machine learning literature, we argue that task demand can be detected automatically, reliably, and unobtrusively using eye movements only. To investigate this possibility, we developed an eye tracking task load detection system and tested its effectiveness. Our results revealed that our task load detection system reliably predicted increased task demand from users' eye movement data.

In a setting with uncertain and endogenous process yield, we study the potential of two features—contract design and sourcing channel—to create mutual benefit in decentralized value chains, where suppliers bear the costs of new technologies while benefits accrue primarily to buyers. Our focus is on agricultural value chains, where parties may transact through a channel that blends farmers’ produce (“commodity-based channel”) or that allows a one-on-one interaction between farmer and processor (“direct-sourcing channel”). Our study provides insights to companies seeking to incorporate responsible sourcing strategies while also creating economic value—a concept called “creating shared value.” We identify that the technology’s “cost elasticity” drives whether switching sourcing channel, changing contract structure, or adopting an integrated change is necessary to create shared value. This highlights that value chain innovations need to be properly designed—and sometimes combined—to achieve sustainable implementation. We also find that certain simple contracts with a linear or bonus structure are optimal, while other intuitive contracts could be detrimental. Using a data set of farms in Patagonia, Argentina, we estimate that the proposed mechanism could increase average supply chain profit by 6.9% while realizing positive environmental benefits. © 2017 INFORMS","Creating shared value; Incentives and contracting; Supply chain management; Sustainable sourcing; Value chain innovations in developing economies","Digital storage; Economics; Structural optimization; Supply chain management; Complex supply chain; Developing economies; Environmental benefits; Incentives and contracting; Shared values; Sourcing strategies; Sustainable sourcing; Technological innovation; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045195052

Under which conditions should a retailer increase its socially-responsible and environmentally-friendly operations to improve efficiency? Our research addresses inconsistent viewpoints in relation to sustainable activities and performance at an operational level, and fills in research gaps in measuring the efficiency of, and identifying the operational mechanisms active in, sustainable retail operations. By collecting data from 124 retailers, we integrate the DEA (data envelopment analysis) model with empirical methods. We first apply DEA models to evaluate the efficiency of retailers. Using efficiency values provided by DEA, we conduct hierarchical regression analysis to examine the influence of socially-responsible and environmentally-friendly operations, and understand the role of sustainable operations in the supply chain. Finally, we use nonlinear analysis to identify the conditions required to increase the efficiency of sustainable operations. Supply chain integration can improve efficiency with higher levels of socio-economic integration and environmental-economic integration. Firms in an internal operational environment with a higher level of financial flow integration and a lower level of physical flow integration are more likely to achieve high retail efficiency. We find two conditions for implementation with managerial insights. When these conditions, characterized by financial flow and physical flow integration, are satisfied, a retailer can increase sustainable operations to increase efficiency. We have a surprising but reasonable finding: the interaction of sustainable operations and physical flow integration is negatively correlated to efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Creating shared value; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Sustainable operations; Sustainable supply chain","Data envelopment analysis; Integration; Liquid metal cooled reactors; Nonlinear analysis; Regression analysis; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Environmentally friendly operations; Hierarchical regression analysis; Operational efficiencies; Operational environments; Shared values; Supply-chain integration; Sustainable operations; Sustainable supply chains; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063762668

We study the post-disaster road clearing problem with the aim of providing a fast and effective method to determine the route of a work troop responsible for clearing blocked roads. The problem is to find a route for the troop that starts at the depot and visits all of the critical locations. The objective is to minimize the total latency of critical nodes, where the latency of a node is defined as the travel time from the depot to that node. A mathematical model for this problem has already been developed in the literature. However, for real-life instances with more than seven critical nodes, this exact formulation cannot solve the problem optimally in a 3-hour limit. To find a near-optimal solution in a short running time, we develop a heuristic that solves a mixed integer program on a transformed network and a lower bounding method to evaluate the optimality gaps. Alternatively, we develop a metaheuristic based on a combination of Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). We test both the matheuristic and the metaheuristic on Istanbul data and show that optimal or near-optimal solutions are obtained within seconds. We also compare our algorithms with existing work in the literature.

The next frontier of customer experience research involves new contexts represented by new channels offered by retailers, thus sparking research interest in the experience lived by customers not only in physical stores but also in virtual stores as a clear representation of the concept of omni-channels. Within this context, consumers’ actions on social media are particularly important because they can act as product or service endorsements to other customers affecting their purchase intentions. In this article, we attempt to bridge the gap between real-world retail experiences and how they connect with the online retail environment through consumer behavior contrasting traditional and eWOM intention at the point of experience immediately after its consumption in a physical setting. In order to do so, a Bayesian hierarchical approach is used to provide an adaptable, low-sample statistical infrastructure for the analysis of the proposed relationships. Our findings show that customer experience in physical stores still have a higher impact on consumer traditional WOM intention than on eWOM intention. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian modeling; Customer experience; e-WOM; Electronic word-of-mouth; Retail; Social media, word-of-mouth","Bayesian networks; Sales; Social networking (online); Bayesian model; Customer experience; Electronic word of mouths; Retail; Word of mouth; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069952563

Research findings revealed the payback time would be around three years, whereas the accumulative fuel cost saving would be over $300,000 by the end of vessel life. The sensitivity analysis using two varying parameters - energy efficiency and investment cost - implied, that the longer payback time would be positively associated with lower energy efficiencies and higher investment costs.

It undermines enabling conditions for sustainable development and posits alarming risks to the global economy. All business entities are dependent to biological diversity and the planetary spectrum of ecosystem services either directly or indirectly and there is a strong debate on why and how the private sector can effectively contribute to ecologically sustainable societies. In this context, corporate biodiversity accounting and reporting seeks to capture information relevant to biodiversity management by employing a certain set of comprehensive, valid and credible quantitative as well as qualitative indicators. This paper seeks to contribute to this direction by providing a critical evaluation of what business entities of mega-diverse countries report on biodiversity conservation and management through widely-accepted performance metrics disclosed in their sustainability reports along with underlying determinants. The assessment relies on a composite disclosure index devised to investigate the comprehensiveness of reported performance on biodiversity management and conservation. By employing Poisson and Gaussian Bayesian regression modeling, potential associations of biodiversity indicators with national specificity, organizational size and industrial affiliation are examined. Crucially, the constructive role of biodiversity accounting and reporting in communicating performance and discharging accountability towards relevant stakeholders is investigated, under the scope of an ecologically sustainable society. Most important predictors of biodiversity indicators disclosure pertain to spatial characteristics (i.e. country effects), along with the industry affiliation of the organizations. In contrast, organizational size does not seem to have a significant effect on the disclosure of biodiversity indicators. In particular, Brazilian, Bolivian and Malaysian enterprises exhibit the highest disclosure levels in biodiversity indicators, whereas the lowest levels are observed for those from Philippines. In terms of differences according to the business sector the sample reporters pertain to, we find biodiversity indicators are mostly reported by enterprises of the materials, energy, industrials, consumer staples and utilities sectors. Comparatively lowest levels are observed for the health care and information technology sectors. Considerable variation among companies, sectors, countries as well as individual indicators is evident. The analysis derived from the study suggests that performance indicators of biological diversity, as part the firm's broader management accounting system, are still underreported and in most cases confined to generic and/or vague statements, with quantitative data and narratives on managing biodiversity being sporadic and limited. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity indicators; Corporate biodiversity disclosure; Disclosure index; Mega-diverse countries; Sustainability accounting and reporting","Conservation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Information management; Sustainable development; Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity indicators; Biodiversity managements; Corporate biodiversity disclosure; Disclosure index; Information technology sector; Management accounting systems; Mega-diverse countries; Biodiversity; biodiversity; bioindicator; business service; conservation management; corporate strategy; ecosystem service; environmental planning; information technology; Poisson ratio; stakeholder; sustainable development; Bolivia; Brazil; Malaysia; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059541930

Numerous studies have tested the pollution haven effect of inter-country industrial relocation. However, little attention has been paid to the effect that is hidden in domestic industry relocation. Considering that domestic investment is about 10-fold that of foreign investment, it is vital to examine this issue to ensure the achievability of China's international pledge of mitigating carbon emissions. This research integrated multiregional input-output analysis and a center of gravity model to visualize the dislocation between carbon emissions, value added, and outputs at a sectoral level from 2007 to 2012 in China. Carbon emissions were also decomposed to three segments of final demand. We also investigated the movement of the center of gravity of these segments, and their dislocation with the outputs. Our analysis found that more carbon emissions had relocated from east to west with domestic industry relocation, yet the opposite was found for value added. Specifically, carbon intensive sectors showed clear tendencies of shifting west. Capital formation was the major cause of the pollution haven effects for the economy as a whole. Thus, our results suggest that pollution haven effects exist in the relocation processes of most sectors. In turn, our findings support the idea that mitigation policies should differ by region and by industry. Our recommendations include a negative list for regions in the west, a mitigation policy for industries with high pollution, and differentiated supply chain management for final demands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Center of gravity; Dislocation; Domestic industry relocation; Multiregional input-output analysis; Pollution haven hypothesis","Dislocations (crystals); Economics; Environmental regulations; Investments; Pollution; Supply chain management; Center of gravity; Domestic industries; Domestic investments; Foreign investment; Industry relocation; Input output analysis; Mitigation policies; Pollution haven hypothesis; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056189342

In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on theories of customer engagement and gamer motivation to capture the evolution of gamers’ latent engagement state and state-dependent participation behavior. We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal data set, obtained from a major international video gaming company, that contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers’ playing histories over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer’s current engagement state “on the fly” and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company. © 2019 INFORMS","Customer engagement; Gamer behavior; Hidden Markov models; Online video games; Optimization","Hidden Markov models; Interactive computer graphics; Motivation; Optimization; Sales; Trellis codes; Analytic modeling; Customer engagement; Gamer behavior; Longitudinal data; Matching algorithm; Online video; Optimization techniques; State-dependent; Human computer interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079270158

The market is divided into a finite number of market segments, with product demand in each segment governed by the multinomial logit (MNL) model. We show that the concavity property with respect to the choice probability vector shown for the MNL model breaks down under MMNL even for entirely symmetric price sensitivities. In addition, the equal markup property identified for the MNL model no longer holds under MMNL, suggesting that heterogeneity in customer population justifies non-equal-markup pricing. In this paper, we characterize the profit function under MMNL as the sum of a set of quasiconcave functions and present efficient optimization algorithms.

Through the application of a socially responsible purchasing (SRP) approach, organisations are attempting to address the challenges of selecting appropriate suppliers to engage with. To achieve SRP, behavioural agency attributes were found to complement traditional agency forms of governance from the start of the process. Through the use of an exploratory case study approach, three focal (purchasing) firms pursuing a strong sustainability agenda, and two supply chain intermediary organisations were investigated. The results show that supplier development activities previously positioned post-selection are now performed at the pre-selection stage, moving them to the beginning of the process. Suppliers must now demonstrate commitment to sustainability through implementing improvements highlighted in corrective action reports at the pre-selection point before any financial transactions occur. The movement of post-selection supplier development activities to the pre-selection stage, to align sustainability goals and reduce risk, is a significant finding of this article that purchasing personnel and suppliers should consider in the establishment of a socially sustainable supply chain. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behavioural agency theory; socially responsible purchasing; supplier selection; Sustainable supply chain management","Sales; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Agency theory; Corrective action reports; Exploratory case studies; Financial transactions; Strong sustainability; Supplier selection; Supplier selection process; Sustainable supply chains; Personnel selection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065815335

Conversely, EU firms are more likely to achieve productivity gains through capital-embodied technological change, at least in the medium- and low-tech macro sectors. Our results also show that the US/EU productivity gap has worsened during the crisis period, as the EU companies have been more affected by the economic crisis in their capacity to translate R&D investments into productivity.

However, the application of safety technologies in the construction industry is limited. One reason for the constrained adoption of safety technologies is the lack of empirical information for mitigating the risk of a failed adoption. The purpose of this paper is to fill the research gap through identifying key factors that predict successful adoption of safety technologies. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 26 key technology adoption predictors were identified and classified using a combination of literature review and an expert panel. The level of influence for each identified safety technology adoption predictor was assessed and ranked using the Relative Importance Index. Analysis of variance was performed as well to assess the potential difference in perceived level of importance for the predictors when the study participants were clustered according to work experience and company size. Findings: Statistical analysis indicates that 12 out of the 26 predictors identified are highly influential regarding technology adoption decision-making in construction. Technology reliability, effectiveness and durability were ranked as the most influential predictors. The participants who work for small companies and who had less than ten years of experience rated individual- and technology-related predictors significantly lower than the experienced participants working for medium and large companies. Practical implications: The present study provides construction researchers and practitioners with valuable information regarding safety technology predictors and their magnitude, both of which are essential elements of a successful safety technology adoption process. Improved technology adoption can enhance workplace safety and minimize worker injuries, providing substantial benefits to the construction industry. Originality/value: This study contributes to technology adoption knowledge by identifying and quantifying the influential predictors of safety technologies in relation to different organizational contexts. The study informs the need to develop an integrated conceptual model for safety technology adoption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mixed method; Safety management; Success predictors; Technology adoption","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Construction industry; Decision making; Construction workers; Design/methodology/approach; Emerging technologies; Mixed method; Organizational context; Safety management; Success predictors; Technology adoption; Occupational risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073953067

This study provides a critical review of published studies on MCDA in the context of HTA by assessing their methodological quality and summarising methodological challenges. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify studies discussing, developing or reviewing the use of MCDA in HTA using aggregation approaches. Studies were classified according to publication time and type, country of study, technology type and study type. The PROACTIVE-S approach was constructed and used to analyse methodological quality. Challenges and limitations reported in eligible studies were collected and summarised; this was followed by a critical discussion on research requirements to address the identified challenges. Results: 129 journal articles were eligible for review, 56% of which were published in 2015–2017; 42% focused on pharmaceuticals; 36, 26 and 18% reported model applications, issues regarding MCDA implementation analyses, and proposing frameworks, respectively. Poor compliance with good methodological practice (< 25% complying studies) was found regarding behavioural analyses, discussion of model assumptions and uncertainties, modelling of value functions, and dealing with judgment inconsistencies. The five most reported challenges related to evidence and data synthesis; value system differences and participant selection issues; participant difficulties; methodological complexity and resource balance; and criteria and attributes modelling. A critical discussion on ways to address these challenges ensues. Discussion: Results highlight the need for advancement in robust methodologies, procedures and tools to improve methodological quality of MCDA in HTA studies. Research pathways include developing new model features, good practice guidelines, technologies to enable participation and behavioural research. © 2019, The Author(s).","Health technology assessment; MCDA modelling; Methodological challenges; Methodological quality; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Systematic review","adult; article; behavioral research; biomedical technology assessment; data synthesis; decision making; female; human; male; practice guideline; publication; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064604470

This paper investigates the effect of S&OP on supply chain performance using the perspective of coordination and contingency theories. A structural equation model was developed in which six S&OP coordination mechanisms were hypothesized to contribute to improved supply chain performance. The model was tested using a global survey of 568 experienced S&OP practitioners. Our results indicate that Strategic Alignment and Information Acquisition/Processing are the mechanisms that most significantly enable superior S&OP outcomes. However, we find that a highly formalized S&OP Procedure inhibits supply chain performance. Furthermore, using a contingency theory perspective, increasing firm size and increasing experience in S&OP amplify the negative effect of a standardized S&OP Procedure upon supply chain performance. Our results suggest that organizational bricolage may be a coordinating mechanism of effective S&OP programs and that managers should empower ambidextrous S&OP teams to maintain balance using self-governing event-driven processes. This paper makes a novel contribution to the S&OP literature by providing evidence of a theoretical construct (organizational bricolage), which may trigger a re-evaluation of the efficacy of prescriptive S&OP procedures that have been advocated by some researchers and practitioners. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Contingency; Coordination; Organizational ambidexterity; S&OP; Structural equation modeling; Supply chain management","Supply chain management; Surveys; Contingency; Coordination; Information acquisitions; Marketing-operations interfaces; Organizational ambidexterity; Sales and operations planning; Structural equation modeling; Supply chain performance; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064109641

Physician rating websites not only act as open platforms for patients to share their experiences, but can also offer valuable feedback for physicians to improve the quality of care. In this study, we analyze over one million physician reviews across 17 medical specialties and investigate the relationship between operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. We combine econometrics models with text analytics techniques to quantify the effect using both patients' ratings of physicians and their qualitative review narratives. The results provide strong empirical evidence that operational inefficiency negatively influences patient satisfaction. Specifically, a waiting time longer than 17 min will, on average, reduce the odds of getting a high rating status by 14%. Though many health care ratings examined in this study do not mitigate the negative effects brought on by long waiting time, patient narratives reflecting the importance of technical and interpersonal qualities to patients suggest a more complex set of relationships between waiting time and patient satisfaction.

This research investigates the effects of trust on contract enforcement in a principal-agent relationship and explores the mediating role of risk perception on those effects. The authors distributed 429 electronic questionnaires and received 280 responses. After deleting responses completed in under 100 s and nonmanager responses, we narrowed the total to 253 valid responses from professionals in the Chinese construction industry. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses in this study, and the findings revealed that goodwill-based trust diminishes the severity of contract enforcement, while perceived relational risk and perceived performance risk increase the severity of contract enforcement. Mediation analyses also support the mediating role of perceived relational risk on the effect of goodwill-based trust on contract enforcement. The findings contribute to contract theory by providing a thorough understanding of contract enforcement and developing a conceptual framework consisting of trust, perceived risk, and contract enforcement. Managers from violating parties may benefit from this article through an understanding of the role of trust and perceived risk in dealing with a contract violation and following the strategies recommended for diminishing the severity of contract enforcement. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Competence-based trust; Contract enforcement; Contract violation; Goodwill-based trust; Perceived performance risk; Perceived relational risk","Construction industry; Regression analysis; Surveys; Chinese construction industry; Competence-based trust; Conceptual frameworks; Contract violation; Electronic questionnaire; Goodwill-based trust; Hierarchical regression analysis; Perceived performance; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057532412

However, most of the ongoing efforts focus on point-valued data, which may suffer from the informational loss. This paper first employs the threshold autoregressive interval-valued (TARI) models developed recently by Sun et al. (2018a) to investigate this transmission, and proposes a novel consistent interval-based test to detect threshold effects, and derives its asymptotic properties. These interval-based TARI model and test, superior to traditional point-based methods, can produce more efficient parameter estimation and more powerful inference due to the informational gain of interval data. That is, interval data simultaneously contain more information (e.g., trend and volatility) than point-valued data during the same period. Empirical results suggest that retail gasoline prices are adjusted upwards faster than downwards, and this short-run asymmetry is statistically significant during the whole sample. Our findings reveal that both the level and volatility of oil prices have a positive impact on the price of gasoline, which contributes to the asymmetries in the transmission of oil price shocks. These results are robust before and after financial crisis. Furthermore, it is interesting to find that after financial crisis, both the error correction adjustment speeds and the asymmetries decrease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetry; Crude oil prices; Gasoline prices; Threshold autoregressive interval-valued regression; Volatility","Crude oil; Error correction; Gasoline; Petroleum analysis; Asymmetry; Crude oil prices; Gasoline prices; Interval-valued; Volatility; Costs; asymmetry; crude oil; numerical model; oil supply; parameter estimation; price dynamics; regression analysis; time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057496321

Based on a sample of Airbnb supply data from 1068 zip codes in 28 major US cities, we apply a mixed-effects negative binomial model to uncover supply determinants. The results confirm the significance of five supply determinant categories, namely, hotel market demand and supply, housing market demand and supply, and short-term rental regulation. We also highlight the respective impacts of supply determinants on three different Airbnb units: entire houses, private rooms, and shared rooms. Moreover, we examine the unique effects of different types of regulation policies. In general, regulations related to tailored legal framework and hostile enforcement significantly decrease Airbnb unit supply. © The Author(s) 2018.","Airbnb supply; home-sharing regulation; hotel market; housing market; mixed-effects negative binomial model","conceptual framework; empirical analysis; housing market; industrial regulation; numerical model; rental sector; urban housing; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060174720

Conversely, little attention has been paid to the end-of-life of infrastructure, i.e. when decommissioning begins. Infrastructure decommissioning projects are long and complex projects, involving an extensive network of stakeholders. Moreover, their budgets can reach hundreds of billions of Euros and, for many of these projects, keep increasing. Since decommissioning projects do not generate direct revenues, they are often considered an expensive nuisance with limited value linked to their delivery. This paper explores the use of Value Management (VM), examining the constraints of decommissioning projects and the requirements for successful implementation of VM, focusing on the nuclear industry due to its techno-socio-economic relevance. Findings derived from the application of content analysis on semi-structured interviews with experienced decommissioning practitioners include suggestions on how to implement VM, ultimately contributing to increase the knowledge on how to deliver decommissioning projects with better performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Infrastructure end-of-life; Megaproject; Nuclear decommissioning; Social challenges; Value management","Budget control; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Economics; Nuclear industry; End of lives; Mega projects; Nuclear decommissioning; Social challenges; Value management; Project management; decommissioning; infrastructure; life cycle analysis; nuclear power; project management; social impact; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060512275

Despite the industry’s far-reaching technological capabilities, BIM has primarily assumed productivity improvement by individual firms, which has not lead to a systemic change in the Finnish architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) business ecosystem. A field study of the Finnish AEC industry has resulted in a critical understanding of why successful and intensive R&D at a national level and wide adoption of BIM technology in Finland has not led to the expected systemic evolution of its AEC business ecosystem. Additionally, a methodology based on inductive grounded theory and historical analysis has been used to capture and identify the evolving and dynamic relationships between various events and actors between 1965 and 2015, which, in turn, has aided in the identification and characterisation of the knowledge and innovation ecosystems.

In practice, however, accuracy is limited by the presence of correlated judgment errors, which often emerge because information is shared. To address this problem, we propose an elicitation procedure in which respondents are asked to provide both their own best judgment and an estimate of the average judgment that will be given by all other respondents. We develop an aggregation method, called pivoting, which separates individual judgments into shared and private information and then recombines these results in the optimal manner. In several studies, we investigate the method and examine the accuracy of the aggregate estimates. Overall, the empirical data suggest that the pivoting method provides an effective judgment aggregation procedure that can significantly outperform the simple crowd average. © 2017 INFORMS.","Forecasting; Judgment aggregation; Shared information; Wisdom of crowds","Forecasting; Management; Operations research; Aggregation methods; Empirical data; Pivoting methods; Private information; Shared information; Wisdom of crowds; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067190850

We show that while, on aggregate, funded startups receive no less financing during the financial crisis than in non-crisis times, VCs allocate relatively more resources to startups operating in the VCs’ core sectors. We show that this skew allocation follows from VCs choosing to double down on their core-sector investing, rather than by a changed mix of investors or startups during the financial crisis. These effects are strongest for early-stage startups, for which information problems are most severe. Furthermore, these results are driven by the investment strategies of more-experienced VCs. Building on these findings, we find superior ex post performance among crisis-funded portfolio startups operating in more-experienced VCs’ core sectors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurial finance; Financial crises; Innovation; Portfolio choice; Startup performance; Venture capital","Strategic planning; Financial crisis; Financing constraints; Investment strategy; Portfolio choice; Start-up performance; Venture Capital; Venture capital investments; Venture capitalists; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058786117

Using contemporaneous and historical data, new estimates are obtained using four revealed-preference techniques: the equal-sacrifice income tax approach, the Euler-equation approach, the Frisch additive-preferences approach and risk aversion in insurance markets. A meta-analysis indicates parameter homogeneity across approaches, and a central estimate of 1.5 for η. The confidence interval excludes unity, the value used in official guidance by the UK government. The term structure of the SDR is then estimated. The result is a short-run SDR of 4.5% declining to 4.2% in the very long-run. This is higher and flatter than the UK official guidance. The difference stems from incorrect calibration of social welfare and estimation of the diffusion of growth. Other things equal, the results suggest that current UK guidance might need to be updated. © 2018, The Author(s).","Cost–Benefit analysis; Elasticity of marginal utility; Social discount rate; Social rate of time preference","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Taxation; Benefit analysis; Confidence interval; Discount rates; Historical data; Insurance markets; Marginal utility; Rate of time preference; Revealed preference; Elasticity; confidence interval; cost-benefit analysis; discount rate; guideline; homogeneity; insurance system; meta-analysis; socioeconomic survey; tax system; trade-off; welfare economics; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044597926

However, an overload of social media content in product search engines can hinder consumers from efficiently seeking information. We propose a structural econometric model to understand consumers' preferences and costs on search engines to improve user experience under unstructured social media. Our model combines an optimal stopping framework with an individual-level random utility choice model and analyzes click behavior in conjunction with purchase choices. Our model accounts for three major constraints in a consumer's decision-making process: (1) interdependency in decision making for different alternatives, (2) sequential arrival of information revealed by click-throughs, and (3) nonnegligible search cost. Our approach allows us to jointly estimate consumers' heterogeneous preferences and search costs under the interplay of social media and search engines, and to predict search and purchase behavior for each consumer. We validate the model using an individual session-level data set of approximately seven million observations resulting in room bookings in 2,117 U.S. hotels. Interestingly, our analysis allows us to quantify the trade-off between consumers' benefits and cognitive costs from using large-scale unstructured social media information during decision making. Our policy experiments show that providing a carefully curated digest of social media content during the earlier stages of consumer search (i.e., on the search results summary page) can lead to a 12.01% increase in the overall search engine revenue. © 2018 INFORMS.","Consumer search; Search cost; Search engines; Social media; Structural modeling","Consumer behavior; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Consumer search; Consumers' preferences; Decision making process; Policy experiments; Search costs; Social media; Social media informations; Structural modeling; Search engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063398129

Our work implies re-estimating published findings for the UK industrial sector on a bigger dataset, incorporating additional observed factors which can plausibly influence the level of emissions and taking into account, for the first time in the empirical literature, unobserved common factors through cross section dependence. In comparison to previous findings we conclude that production inputs, total factor productivity and economies of scale cannot be relied upon to reduce emissions from industrial sector. We provide evidence that reduction in emissions can be reliably delivered by reducing energy consumption, encouraging fuel substitution and by encouraging market competition so that one can counteract the increase in emissions related to higher level of capital investment. We observe considerable similarities in the relationship between market concentration on one side and industrial emissions and innovation on the other side.

An in-site WOM system can potentially boost customer conversion by conveying signals and information about product popularity and quality. However, implementing such a system might also have unintended consequences, hindering product sales because of the lack of control over WOM volume and content. This study examines how implementing a WOM system (through social media integration) on an e-commerce website affects customer conversion in the two stages of the consumer purchase funnel, namely, adding a product to the cart and placing an order. Identifying the causal effect of WOM system implementation is challenging because e-commerce websites usually make their decisions based on private information about the potential impact of the system and may have simultaneously implemented other initiatives that could confound the effect. As a result, we conducted a randomized field experiment in collaboration with a large e-commerce website in the United States by testing two versions of a web page: one with a WOM system (treatment) and one without (control). We find that the impact of a WOM system implementation on customer conversion is moderated by WOM volume such that its effect is positive above a threshold of volume (measured by the number of comments) and negative below the threshold. Additionally, we find that WOM valence reinforces the impact of a WOM system on customer conversion. These results suggest that a social-learning mechanism is in play. Furthermore, our results show that the impact of a WOM system mostly occurs at the consideration stage in the upper purchase funnel (adding a product to the cart) rather than at the evaluation stage in the lower funnel (placing an order). Our study not only contributes to research on online system design but also offers practical implications for implementing and managing WOM systems on e-commerce websites. © 2019 INFORMS.","Consumer purchase funnel; Randomized field experiment; Social learning; Word-of-mouth (WOM) system","Electronic commerce; Online systems; Purchasing; Systems analysis; Websites; Consumer purchase; Customer conversion; Field experiment; Private information; Social learning; System implementation; Unintended consequences; Word of mouth; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079278328

This paper builds on the neoclassical labor-leisure model to examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior, game provider's strategies, and social welfare. When the game provider offers virtual currency for sale, players have two options to obtain virtual currency-playing the game and purchasing virtual currency directly. We introduce a parameter-the enabling-power rate of virtual currency-to characterize the extent to which virtual currency generated in a unit of playing time can augment players' production of gaming leisure. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing time for certain heavy players, whereas it boosts certain light players' playing time. It may also lead to a larger player base allowing more people to enjoy the benefits of playing digital games when the enabling-power rate of virtual currency is sufficiently high. The game provider should charge a higher (lower) virtual currency price for a game with a relatively lower (higher) enabling-power rate of virtual currency. She should also set a higher (lower) ad level for a game with a relatively higher (lower) enabling-power rate if the game's base valuation of gameplay, that is, the valuation of gameplay independent of virtual currency, is sufficiently low.

Using a unique 50-month longitudinal panel data set on 1677 software design crowdsourcing contests, we illustrate a learning effect where participants are able to improve their skills (learn) more when competing against a superstar than otherwise. We show that an individual's probability of winning in subsequent contests increases significantly more after she has participated in a contest with a superstar coder than otherwise. We build a dynamic structural model with individual heterogeneity where individuals choose contests to participate in and where learning in a contest happens through an information theory-based Bayesian learning framework.We find that individuals with lower ability to learn tend to value monetary reward highly, and vice versa. The results indicate that individuals who greatly prefer monetary reward tend to win fewer contests, as they rarely achieve the high skills needed to win a contest. Counterfactual analysis suggests that instead of avoiding superstars, individuals should be encouraged to participate in contests with superstars early on, as it can significantly push them up the learning curve, leading to higher quality and a higher number of submissions per contest. Overall, our study shows that individuals who are willing to forego short-term monetary rewards by participating in contests with superstars have much to gain in the long term. © 2019, INFORMS.","Bayesian learning; Crowdsourcing contests; Dynamic programming; Dynamic structural model; Economics of information system; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Superstar effect; Utility","Crowdsourcing; Economics; Information theory; Markov processes; Quality control; Software design; Bayesian learning; Economics of information; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Structural modeling; Superstar effect; Utility; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065388115

In addition, we ask what types of businesses are most likely to benefit from such promotions. Following alcohol revenue for restaurants using e-coupons, we find that offering a coupon increases demand during the promotion, and to a lesser degree after the promotion, suggesting that coupons can be used to price discriminate, while an advertising effect is less obvious. While coupons increase profits on average, the effect on each firm's profits depends on the firm's characteristics. © 2018 INFORMS.","Coupons; Daily-deal sites; Market expansion; Price discrimination; Revenue cannibalization","Marketing; Profitability; Advertising effects; Consumer demands; Coupons; Daily-deal sites; Market expansions; Most likely; Price discrimination; Price promotions; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057222012

The supplier needs to decide on two issues regarding the payment mechanism: (a) the payment term, whether to collect payment early or late, and (b) the payment approach, to collect personally or through a third party. Focusing on these two issues, this study examines and compares the influence of three supply chain finance schemes: early payment, delayed payment, and reverse factoring on the financial performance of the supplier and retailer. We found delayed payment offers additional benefits to the supplier and retailer when the supplier has the financing advantage (i.e., a lower capital cost), and early payment and reverse factoring offer additional benefits to the supplier and retailer when the retailer has the financing advantage. With the bank's involvement and intermediation role, the increase in profits for the supplier and retailer, when using reverse factoring, is even higher than when early payment is used. The greater the difference in capital cost between the supplier and retailer, the greater the efficiency of the three financial schemes. Additionally, the financial schemes are more valuable with a higher production cost and higher demand volatility. Our study provides incentives and guidelines for the supplier and retailer to offer and use various financial programs to achieve better financial performance when faced with stochastic customer demand. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Delayed payment; Early payment; Reverse factoring; Supply chain finance","Sales; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Delayed payment; Early payment; Financial performance; Financial program; Financial schemes; Payment mechanism; Reverse factoring; Supply chain finances; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067229043

We present a startup survival model that distinguishes between access to social capital and using it. Empirical tests with the longitudinal Kauffman Firm Survey find that those startups that use social capital by collaborating with other agents (universities, industries, and government organizations) significantly outperform startups that do not. However, we also observe that the amount of social capital available in an ecosystem counterintuitively does not correlate with a tenant's use of it, and correlates weakly with longer life expectancy. These results are moderated by whether the tenant is a high-tech startup or not. Findings contribute to extant research in innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

We investigated these variables with a sample of 117 previous participants in the International Training Course on Organic Agriculture, which took place in Uganda. To frame the analysis, concepts of sustainability learning and transformative learning were transferred into a research instrument, building on the Graduate Study Cooperative survey, the Transformative Learning Survey, and the Environmental Attitudes Inventory. The findings showed that the training course provided a transformative experience that positively predicted 1) environmental attitudes; 2) professional and personal competencies at graduation; 3) the feeling of being able to personally influence sustainability and the perception that one's employer has an influence on sustainability. No significant relation between the transformative experience and engagement in voluntary work was found. While ex post facto studies based on self-reported perceptions have limitations, this is—to our knowledge—the first study to apply the Transformative Learning Survey combined with other instruments to a specific learning intervention. By showing that transformative university learning experiences can contribute to sustainability attitudes, skills, and agency, the findings support the case for transdisciplinary course designs rooted in real-world sustainability challenges.

Although a priority for development cooperation, building or developing research capacity is often reduced in practice to promoting knowledge transfers, for example through North–South partnerships. Research capacity building/development tends to focus on developing scientists’ technical competencies through training, without parallel investments to develop and sustain the socioeconomic and political structures that facilitate knowledge creation. This, the paper argues, significantly contributes to the scientific divide between developed and developing countries more than any skills shortage. Using Charles Taylor’s concept of irreducibly social goods, the paper extends Sen’s Capabilities Approach beyond its traditional focus on individual entitlements to present a view of scientific knowledge as a social good and the capability to produce it as a social capability. Expanding this capability requires going beyond current fragmented approaches to research capacity building to holistically strengthen the different social, political and economic structures that make up a nation’s innovation system. This has implications for the interpretation of human rights instruments beyond their current focus on access to knowledge and for focusing science policy and global research partnerships to design approaches to capacity building/development beyond individual training/skills building. © 2018, The Author(s).","Capabilities approach; Capacity building; Collective or social capabilities; Development; Low and middle income countries; North–South partnerships; Research systems; Science technology and innovation","capacity building; developing country; economics; ethical theory; ethics; human; international cooperation; invention; knowledge; research; technology; Capacity Building; Developing Countries; Ethical Theory; Humans; International Cooperation; Inventions; Knowledge; Research; Technology Transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045149085

Research has previously established that structural assurance and situational normality have differential effects on vendor and technology-based trust. Generalized expectancies are used as a theory for understanding how people trust and transfer trust in the context of electronic commerce technologies. In theory, there should be differential cause-and-effect relationships between trust antecedents and transfer of trust between physical and virtual environments. This study reports the results of a randomized experiment on the effects of structural assurance and situational normality on the transfer of electronic commerce trust between physical and virtual environments. A pretest-treatment-posttest design using MANOVA revealed that structural assurance, situational normality, and direction of transfer have differential effects on vendor-based trust and technology-based trust. Structural assurance prevents loss of trust in physical-to-virtual transfers, and both situational normality and structural assurance cause increases in trust for virtual-to-physical transfers for technology-based trust, but not necessarily for vendor-based trust.

Research Methods: In-depth semi-structured interview data were collected from 24 stakeholders related to community sport facilities (n = 12 facility managers, n = 6 regional grant managers, n = 6 national funders both third sector and corporate). The qualitative data were thematically analysed to understand the impact of austerity on how community sport facilities managed their organisations and operations. Results and Findings: The findings from this research offer insight into the challenges that community sport facilities are encountering which have resulted from austerity, and a shrinking of the funding from the central Government to local public services. Furthermore, different community sport facilities have navigated these challenges to maintain sustainability, essentially through adapting network structure and through income dynamism. In addition, using a network theory approach alongside RDT within a sporting context has allowed us to address issues on how network flow and structure impact sustainability and operations within and between organisations.

Customers are characterized by a diverse set of demographic and transactional attributes. The retailer can personalize the customers' assortment offerings based on available profile information to maximize cumulative revenue. To that end, the retailer must estimate customer preferences by observing transaction data. This, however, may require a considerable amount of data and time given the broad range of customer profiles and large number of products available. At the same time, the retailer can aggregate (pool) purchasing information among customers with similar product preferences to expedite the learning process. We propose a dynamic clustering policy that estimates customer preferences by adaptively adjusting customer segments (clusters of customers with similar preferences) as more transaction information becomes available. We test the proposed approach with a case study based on a data set from a large Chilean retailer. The case study suggests that the benefits of the dynamic clustering policy under the MNL model can be substantial and result (on average) in more than 37% additional transactions compared to a data-intensive policy that treats customers independently and in more than 27% additional transactions compared to a linear-utility policy that assumes that product mean utilities are linear functions of available customer attributes. We support the insights derived from the numerical experiments by analytically characterizing settings in which pooling transaction information is beneficial for the retailer, in a simplified version of the problem. We also show that there are diminishing marginal returns to pooling information from an increasing number of customers. © 2017 INFORMS.","Data-driven assortment planning; Dynamic clustering; Multiarmed bandit; Personalization","Statistical tests; Assortment planning; Customer preferences; Customer profiles; Dynamic clustering; Multi armed bandit; Numerical experiments; Personalizations; Transaction information; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067200261

In the literature, IT or its applications play a paramount role in enabling firms to offer superior services and consequently deepen the relationships with their customers. Although already applied to augment customer experience and increase participation in practice, how blockchain applications interact with the LP context is still largely unknown in IS research. The objective of this research is to explore how blockchain, as an IT artifact on the rise, influences value creation in a LP context. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this paper considers both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in a LP context guided by SDT regulation: meeting the needs of Economy, Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness, and explores the effects of blockchain application on customers’ motivations, which influence value perception and participative behaviors. By using an exploratory case study of BubiChain in China, we collected data through semi-structured interviews and extracted from the raw data of BubiChain-based loyalty point exchange platform, including real-time, multi-brands, peer-to-peer, and secure, traceable and fraud-proof exchange. We found that these features of blockchain applications not only improve customers’ economic perceived value by meeting their extrinsic motivation but also enhance their social interaction and psychological self-fulfillment value perception by satisfying their intrinsic motivations, thus increasing customers’ experience and participative behaviors. We also synthesized the results and theorized the findings into 4 formal testable propositions, which would offer testable hypotheses for future empirical studies. This paper reveals an innovative breakthrough on SDT theory and LP research, and is an early attempt to analyze how the blockchain is applied to LPs. We endeavor to establish a theoretical overview of how the key features of blockchain-driven point exchange platform influence customers’ motivations, which affect value perception and consequently induce participative behaviors in a loyalty point context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Block chain; Loyalty programs; Motivations; Perceived value; Self-determination theory","Motivation; Sales; Exploratory case studies; Extrinsic motivation; Intrinsic motivation; Perceived value; Program participation; Qualitative approach; Self-determination theories; Semi structured interviews; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070221989

Design/methodology/approach: Using data obtained from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, the United States’ (US) International Energy Statistics and the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) Factbooks from 1980 to 2016, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework is used to determine the long- and short-run impact of the selected infrastructure stock and quality indices on Ghana’s economic growth. Findings: Findings indicate a statistically significant relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth. Additionally, electricity-generating capacity is identified as the infrastructure stock index that has the greatest positive impact on Ghana’s economic growth. The study reveals that electricity-distribution loss has a significant negative effect over both long- and short-run periods. Research limitations/implications: Commercial petroleum export from Ghana since 2010 has been a key contributor to economic growth. Although its aggregate effect is included in the annual GDP figures adopted for the study, the authors would have wished to assess its impact on GDP as an independent standard growth determinant. However, because of a lack of available data over this study period, petroleum exports could not be adopted as an independent standard growth determinant. Additionally, an aggregated index of infrastructure stock and quality could not be derived because of the small size of data available. Hence, this study did not assess its impact on Ghana’s economic growth. Practical implications: The research provides pragmatic guidance to policymakers to focus their efforts on expanding electricity-generating capacity while simultaneously taking steps to curb electricity transmission and distribution losses. These two related actions offer the greatest positive impact on infrastructure development and, as a consequence, Ghana’s economic growth. Originality/value: This paper represents the first attempt to empirically study the relationship between infrastructure development and Ghana’s economic growth. A key contribution to the existing body of knowledge includes strong evidence of a positive effect of infrastructure development upon Ghana’s economic growth. Results also reveal that the greatest positive impact on economic growth is derived from electricity-generation capacity. However, the study also uncovers a negative, but statistically significant, relationship between road and economic growth. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL); Economic growth; Electricity-distribution losses; Electricity-generating capacity; Infrastructure development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068028012

When these are ignored they may lead to competitive struggles. In this paper, we build on this view and suggest that big data analytics can provide necessary insights to help change strategy making. Research suggests that ambidextrous organisations should focus on developing and maintaining their dynamic capabilities. Following on from this, we take a dynamic capabilities perspective and propose a theoretical framework to explain the intricacies of big data analytics. This framework explains the ability of organisations to detect, anticipate and respond strategically in ambiguous and uncertain business environments. For a meta-synthesis of 101 cases of big data analytics, we employ a multi-method approach that incorporates Natural Language Processing, semantic analysis and case analysis, allowing extraction and analysis of structured information from unstructured data. Overall, we find evidence of big data analytics helping to detect, anticipate and respond to industry disruption. We offer six propositions about the relationships between the levels of data analytics capabilities and strategic dynamic capabilities. We find that descriptive data analytics improves the capability of an organisation to understand the business context (sensing) and that predictive data analytics aids in the realisation of business opportunities (seizing). This study contributes to an understanding of big data analytics as a dynamic organisational capability that supports strategic decision-making in times of ambiguity and uncertainty. We conclude by suggesting areas for further investigation, particularly in regard to the strategic application of prescriptive data analytics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Data analytics; Dynamic capabilities; Strategy","Data mining; Decision making; Enterprise resource management; Natural language processing systems; Predictive analytics; Semantics; Business opportunities; Data analytics; Dynamic capabilities; Organisational capabilities; Strategic decision making; Strategy; Structured information; Theoretical framework; Big data; artificial intelligence; business development; data set; decision making; game theory; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048439813

However, in the absence of a systematic methodology to support the process, this task has been described as “more art than science”. Objectives hierarchies often tend to become large and constraining the size of a hierarchy can be challenging. This paper proposes and illustrates the use of a set of methods to support the simplification of the hierarchies in contexts that are “data rich” and characterised by many objectives. The aim of using the proposed approach is to support decision analysts in developing an appropriately concise decision model for the further interactions with the stakeholders. Using data from two completed environmental cases we show retrospectively how qualitative (means-ends networks), semi-quantitative (relevancy analysis) and quantitative (correlation analysis, principal component analysis, local sensitivity analysis of weights) methods, used alone or in combination, can inform hierarchy development. We evaluate the potential benefits and challenges of each method and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the simplification of an objectives hierarchy. Questionnaire-based relevancy analysis can be a useful method to identify and communicate important objectives in the early phases of an MCDA process with stakeholders, while correlation analysis can help to identify overlapping objectives, particularly in cases having many objectives and alternatives. It is intended that the methods support a facilitator in developing a clear understanding of the problem and also prompt deeper thinking about and discussion of the appropriate structure and content of an objectives hierarchy with the stakeholders involved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioural OR; Multiple criteria analysis; OR in environment; Problem structuring","Correlation methods; Decision making; Sensitivity analysis; Surveys; Behavioural OR; Correlation analysis; Local sensitivity analysis; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multiple criteria analysis; OR in environment; Problem structuring; Systematic methodology; Principal component analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062811402

Mixture cure models, with their ability to predict not only whether borrowers will default but also when they are likely to default, have been applied to credit scoring. We propose a prediction-driven mixture cure model, which sacrifices interpretability for potentially better prediction performance, and apply it to credit scoring. In the incidence part of the mixture cure model, we substitute the typical statistical incidence model (i.e., logistic regression) with a more flexible, and hopefully more accurate, classification method (i.e., random forests). For the latency part, we propose a survival analysis model, named Time-Dependent Hazards, which accommodates a direct relationship between failure times and covariates and can potentially better predict the probability of default over time than the standard Cox PH model. Empirical evaluation using real-world data from a major P2P lending institution in China shows that both extensions contributed to performance improvement in both discrimination and calibration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Mixture cure model; P2P lending; Random forests; Risk analysis; Time-dependent hazards","Curing; Decision trees; Forecasting; Hazards; Mixtures; Risk analysis; Risk management; Classification methods; Empirical evaluations; Mixture cure model; P2p lending; Prediction performance; Probability of defaults; Random forests; Time dependent; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061663974

Moreover, it aims to spell out the areas for further research on WCM so that the body of knowledge can be expanded. A systematic literature review of the research works on WCM has been performed using Google Scholar. Articles with citations of 50 and above as of June 05, 2018 are considered for the detailed citation based analysis. Further, classification of such articles has been done on the basis of common themes followed by a thorough content analysis. The citation based analysis suggests that there is a growing popularity of studies related to WCM in recent times. However, majority of the impactful studies are published in relatively lower category journals. This further intrigues us to explore the content of such studies. Based on the content, the studies are classified under five different themes. It is found that majority of the highly cited articles have examined the relation between the WCM and profitability of the firms. Moreover, repetitive uses of few proxies in such studies have also been identified. This finding most probably explains the reason behind so many highly cited articles getting published in relatively lower category journals. In view of this, this study tries to explore further scope of research on WCM and lists down potential research questions for the future researches. Firstly, it provides an idea about the most cited area of researches related to WCM and the recent growth of studies in this domain. Academicians can decide upon their future area of research based on the findings related to the proxies and outcome from these studies. Secondly, it shows the most popular avenue of publishing the articles related to WCM which will certainly motivate the researchers to pursue such study. It has been found from the analysis that majority of the impactful articles are published in lower category journals. Therefore, this study identifies the reason behind the same and lists down some innovative research questions to provide some future research directions. Thirdly, the finance managers can use this finding to identify the relevant consequences of poor WCM. Finally, it can serve as a reference point for all future ideas related to WCM. The paper classifies the present literature on WCM into five major themes and performs a content analysis of the same. This is essential as the content analysis highlights different proxies used as inputs which effectively drive efficient WCM.

It provides the full calculation and input metric contributions for each of the predictions it derives. There are two stages in executing TOB predictions (stage 1 matches and ranks using squared-error analysis; stage 2 optimizes and conducts sensitivity analysis). Neither stage involves generating or extrapolating correlations between the input variables. Both stages of the calculation generate accurate predictions for datasets with multiple, highly-dispersed and non-linear influencing inputs. The transparent way in which generates predictions leads to better understanding of the interplays between the input variables. Such attributes have direct relevance to the complex systems modelled in the coal industry [e.g., gas calorific value (GCV) prediction and coal petrology–grindability relationships]. The algorithm is applied here to predict GCA for a large published database (6339 records) of US coals including proximate and ultimate analysis metrics. The TOB predicts GCV with accuracy (RMSE ≤ 0.3 MJ/kg; R2 &gt; 0.99). The transparency of the TOB method contrasts with the hidden relationships involved in many neural-network based prediction systems. Worked examples are provided to show the detailed prediction calculations associated with individual data points. The TOB approach applied to predicting coal GCV can help to verify the source of specific samples (e.g. specific mines or coal basins) using readily understandable underlying calculations available for audit and display. The TOB is therefore also suitable for identifying the provenance of specific coal samples based on proximate and/or ultimate analysis. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Auditing prediction calculations; Forensic interrogation of coal learning network; Learning network for coal GCA; Predicting non-linear systems without deriving correlations; Transparent GCA prediction","algorithm; artificial neural network; coal industry; correlation; forensic science; machine learning; nonlinearity; numerical model; prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084526784

In particular, we estimate the impact of these factors on Tobin's Q, which represents the overall technological and market strength of a firm as a forward-looking market performance reflecting stakeholders’ expectations of the value of a firm. Using complementary regression and a neural network approach, we find that operational efficiency has the largest impact on Tobin's Q, followed by corporate reputation and environmental sustainability. In addition to its findings on the relative importance of these strategic factors, the paper's findings also suggest that operational efficiency, which reflects efficiency-driven best practice and managerial proficiency, is a crucial determinant of the market-facing measure of Tobin's Q in high-tech industries. Using models to estimate the interaction between these variables, we find that environmental sustainability and its interaction with reputation has the largest synergistic effect on Tobin's Q, followed by the interaction of reputation and operational efficiency. Our results show that the interaction of unique performance metrics can provide insights that differ from those derived from models for which the interaction is not included. Furthermore, the discovery of varying impact patterns under distinguishable capabilities is another significant finding of the paper. © 2019","Corporate reputation; Environmental greening; Neural networks; Operational efficiency; Tobin's Q","Commerce; Efficiency; Neural networks; Corporate reputations; Data envelope analysis; Environmental greening; Environmental sustainability; Operational efficiencies; Performance metrics; Synergistic effect; Tobin's Q; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061320461

The response of local economies to manmade and natural shocks is hypothesized to depend on the centrality of local industries within the economy, or how well connected they are to the other industries. We first calculate a centrality value for each industry using the national Input-Output accounts. We then ‘step down’ these values to the county level using industry employment data. We then test empirically whether local economies containing more centralized industries were more resilient, using a resilience measure that compares the local employment rebound and decline during the Great Recession.

We focus on the quality assurance of dairy products, which is considered one of the fundamental influential factors. We investigate interrelationships among the identified determinants, which include dairy production behavior, dairy cow culture model, government regulations, corporate social responsibility, and quality assurance, and examine how these determinants influence the competitive advantage of dairy supply chains. We employ the structural equation modeling approach in which grouped observable variables that represent the identified determinants are extrapolated from primary data collected through a questionnaire survey. Our key findings show that by mediating the effects of dairy production behavior and the dairy cow culture model, government regulation and corporate social responsibility significantly affect the quality assurance of dairy products. In turn, dairy production behavior and the dairy cow culture model significantly affect the competitive advantage of the dairy supply chain via the fully mediated effects of the quality assurance of dairy products. Specifically, the dairy cow culture model helps ensure the safety and quality of milk supply, allowing core dairy firms to control product quality throughout the dairy supply chain.

We also manipulate whether the risk associated with unsold inventory lies with the retailer or the supplier or is endogenously determined in the bargaining process. One key insight is that supply chain efficiency is significantly higher when the order quantity is included in the negotiation and that, contrary to the normative theory, this leads to a Pareto improvement whereby both the supplier and retailer earn higher profits. A second important result, also counter to the normative theory, is that the party incurring the cost of unsold inventory always earns a lower profit than its counterpart, regardless of the bargaining environment or inventory risk location. To explain these data, we posit that retailers and suppliers are affected by an anchoring bias and demonstrate that it can explain many of our results. © 2018 INFORMS.","Bargaining; Behavioral operations management; Inventory risk allocation; Supply chain contracting","Profitability; Sales; Bargaining; Behavioral operations; Pareto improvements; Risk allocation; Supply chain contracting; Supply chain efficiency; Two-stage supply chains; Whole sale prices; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060692527

However, an inappropriate selection may compromise the financial and operational status of the enterprise. But vendor selection is a complex, multi-criteria decision-making process because different and conflicting criteria have to be considered and assessed in order to find consistent suppliers. Consequently, evaluating and selecting the best vendor is the key to successful business. Traditionally, vendors are normally selected on the basis of traditional criteria (TC), such as costs and quality, neglecting resilience criteria (RC) (e.g. agility and flexibility). Thus, enterprises ultimately realize that a selecting method which involves TC as the only ones is inefficient and needs to be changed. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This study was set in motion by a problem in practice. It aims to provide a user-friendly decision-making tool for selecting the best vendor from a group which submitted their tenders for implementing a proposed radio frequency identification (RFID)-based passport tracking system (Dukyil et al., 2017). The main traditional and resilience (“trasilience” henceforth) selection criteria were identified in a unified framework in collaboration with experts in the institution. Next, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) algorithm was used to determine the relative importance of each criterion and the weights thus obtained were integrated into the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) algorithm. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm was also applied, to evaluate the performance of vendors and to select the best one. The qualitative evaluation of the criteria and the vendors was based on four decision makers. Finally, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) approach was applied to obtain the statistical difference between the ranking orders obtained from the two algorithms. Findings: The efficiency of the proposed decision-making tool was evident from the real-case study of six tenders submitted for implementing a RFID-based passport tracking system. The SRCC also turned out a “very strong” association value between TOPSIS and ELECTRE. Practical implications: The developed trasilient decision-making tool can easily be used to solve similar vendor or supplier selection problem. Moreover, other criteria can be added to fit other cases. Later, the tool was made available to the institution under study for solving future evaluation problems. Originality/value: The literature shows that none of the previous papers presented an integrated trasilient approach that considers RC and TC simultaneously. This study presents a new trasilience tool for selecting a vendor. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; DEMATEL; ELECTRE; TOPSIS; Traditional and Resilience; Vendor selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058137526

The paper shows that there is no single path of technology upgrading. Instead, we find several unique paths with different trade-offs between intensity, structural change and the nature of the global interaction. All BRICS economies display increased generation of frontier technological activities, while China and Russia have also increased the intensity of behind frontier technological activities. China has also diversified its technology knowledge base and entered into dynamic frontier areas. With increasing intensity of frontier technology activities of the BRICS, the relative, but not absolute, the importance of foreign actors and international collaboration has declined.

It remains unclear how quality efforts and patient concern levels affect SC performance and how medical equipment manufacturers’ quality effort levels are linked to their patient concern levels. This study focuses on the impact of a manufacturer's and a retailer's patient concern levels on optimal pricing and quality decisions in an SC consisting of a manufacturer facing quality effort-dependent demand and a retailer in the medical equipment industry. We use the Stackelberg game to characterize and determine the optimal operational decisions in five scenarios and address the effects of patient concern levels under above five scenarios. A real case is studied and shows that optimized quality efforts can improve SC profits. The parameters settings are derived from the real data. Our findings bridge the gap between SC quality management and patient benefits and help to understand contract design in relation to patient concerns in different SC structures. This paper is among the earliest to investigate quality efforts for SC contract design in relation to patient concerns and to study SC contract design in the medical equipment industry. Our managerial insights are expected to help manufacturers move toward better quality effort decisions considering patient benefits and are also applicable to other SCs with effort-dependent demand and the effect of altruistic preferences. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Quality management; Supply chain contract; Supply chain management; Sustainability; Welfare","Bridges; Manufacture; Profitability; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Equipment industries; Equipment manufacturers; Operational decisions; Optimal pricing; Parameters setting; Stackelberg Games; Supply chain contracts; Welfare; Quality management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068534293

Unlike the extant literature that has emphasized stakeholder and regulatory pressures, this paper argues that voluntary carbon disclosure is both beneficial and costly for corporations with respect to the existence of supportive management structures, explicit CSR practices, and the existence of complementary assets. Moreover, there is variation between European firms and other global businesses because of Europe's distinctive national business systems framework in conjunction with global supply chain imperatives. Empirically, this study employs a novel discrete-continuous modeling approach to distinguish between a corporation's decision to disclose and the linked but subsequent decision of how much to disclose climate change information. Results indicate that the main drivers of participation in voluntary carbon disclosure by the Global 500 firms is the existence of senior managers and executive-level officers and the adoption of ESG principles by global businesses. Conditional on participation, European Union-based and other global businesses that articulate a corporate vision for environmental sustainability, adopt ESG principles, and invest in complementary assets disclose climate change strategies and emissions at higher levels than companies without these internal firm capabilities. This study has implications for national climate policy and global climate change governance more generally, both of which increasingly focus on concrete climate solutions by corporations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","carbon disclosure; climate change policy; corporate management; corporate social responsibility; firm-level analysis; global businesses; industry self-regulation; private regulation","carbon emission; climate change; corporate social responsibility; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; global climate; management; regulatory framework",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067336567

The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24. The conversion of sustainability cue recognition (24%–97% of respondents depending on the cue) to actual IPB was shown in this study to be cue specific and low at 10% or less except the Fairtrade logo at 22%. Statistically significant differences within the sample population were observed for recognition by age, income and education and for IPB by income and education (p < 0.05) but again this was cue specific. Four distinct consumer clusters were identified with income being a differentiating factor for the cluster with high awareness and high IPI.

Previous AFVs diffusion studies have considered static preferences, but preferences for complex products such as AFVs are likely to change under different market conditions. Therefore, using static preferences for demand forecasts may compromise the accuracy of those predictions. This study aims at incorporating dynamic preferences on a reference AFVs diffusion model and analyzing if adapting subsidy policies according to those preferences will provide more cost-effective results on AFVs adoption. A System Dynamics model adapted to the Portuguese market was developed to study the impact of considering dynamic preferences and several incentive policies adapted to such preferences. Two system dynamics models are developed for comparative purposes: one considering static preferences and other one considering dynamic preferences. According to the results derived from these models, the model with dynamic preferences predicts a higher market penetration of AFVs, mainly due to the increment of Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles and Battery Electric Vehicle market shares. These results show that considering dynamic consumer preferences has a significant impact on AFVs diffusion predictions. The subsidies scenarios allow concluding that designing subsidies according to the evolution of preferences stimulated AFVs adoption more effectively. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Alternative fuel vehicles; Diffusion model; Dynamic preferences; System dynamics","Alternative fuels; Battery electric vehicles; Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Diffusion; Forecasting; System theory; Alternative fuel vehicles; Consumer preferences; Diffusion model; Incentive policies; Market penetration; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; accuracy assessment; alternative fuel; automobile; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electric vehicle; energy market; policy approach; prediction; technology diffusion; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069677592

Technological innovation offers a range of renewable generation and energy management options which require fine tuning and accurate control to be successful, which calls for the use of large-scale, detailed datasets. In this paper, we focus on the UK and use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)to evaluate electricity generation options against technical, environmental and social criteria. Data incompleteness and redundancy, usual in large-scale datasets, as well as expert opinion ambiguity are dealt with using a comprehensive grey TOPSIS model. We used evaluation scores to develop a multi-objective optimization model to maximize the technical, environmental and social utility of the electricity generation mix and to enable a larger role for innovative technologies. Demand uncertainty was handled with an interval range and we developed our problem with multi-objective grey linear programming (MOGLP). Solving the mathematical model provided us with the electricity generation mix for every 5 min of the period under study.

Our results illustrate that the nature and intensity of competition among the information provider’s customers play first-order roles in determining the information provider’s optimal strategy. We show that when the customers view their actions as strategic complements, the provider finds it optimal to offer the most accurate information at the provider’s disposal to all potential customers. In contrast, when buyers view their actions as strategic substitutes, the provider maximizes the provider’s profits by either (i) restricting the overall supply of the information product or (ii) distorting its content by offering a product of inferior quality.

A participative observation approach is adopted to collect the data on the case study of Microlets, a shared mobility service in Timor-Leste, for validating the framework. We successfully demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to show how access-based business model innovations can minimize issues such as accessibility and affordability, and spur economic growth by giving importance to the factors of contextual intelligence. Three different business model innovation options were compared across the differentiating factors surrounding the contextual requirements of the frontier market to validate the relevance of our framework. By examining factors such as the institutional environment, industry dynamics and infrastructural development, the proposed framework will guide decision-makers to cope up with the inherent uncertainty of frontier markets while developing access-based business models. © 2019","Access-based services; Business model innovation; Contextual intelligence; Frontier markets; Shared-mobility; Timor-Leste","Decision making; Access-based services; Business model innovation; Contextual intelligence; Contextual requirements; Economic growths; Industry dynamics; Infrastructural development; Timor-Leste; Commerce; accessibility; developing world; innovation; mobility; service sector; transportation economics; transportation system; transportation technology; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles; Timor; Timor-Leste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061830675

Here we are particularly concerned with a final phase of operations and the opportunity to place only a single order to cover demand during this phase. The problem is further complicated when the service logistics context can change during this final phase, e.g. as the number of systems supported or the LSO's resources change. Such a problem is typical of the final phase of many military operations. The LSO operates the recovery and repair loop for the equipment in question. By developing a simulation of the LSO, we can generate synthetic operational data regarding equipment breakdowns, etc. We then split that data into a training set and a test set in order to compare several approaches to forecasting demand in the final operational phase. We are particularly interested in the application of Bayesian network models for this type of forecasting since these offer a way of combining hard observational data with subjective expert opinion. Different LSO configurations were simulated to create a test dataset and the simulation results were compared with the various forecasts. The BN that learned from training data performed best, followed by a hybrid BN design combining expert elicitation and machine learning, and then a logistic regression model. An expert-adjusted exponential smoothing model was the poorest performer and these differences were statistically significant.

However, in the ever-increasing field of urban measurement and analysis, the challenges cities face are frequently presumed: crime and fear of crime, social inequality, environmental degradation, economic deterioration and disjointed governance. Although it may be that many cities share similar problems, it is unwise to assume that cities share the same challenges, to the same degree or in the same combination. And yet, diagnosing the challenges a city faces is often overlooked in preference for improving the understanding of known challenges. To address this oversight, this study evidences the need to diagnose urban challenges, introduces a novel mixed-methods approach for doing so, applies (and critiques) the approach to the city of Birmingham, UK, and proposes a set of principles for the transferability of this new urban diagnostic methodology to other cities. The paper argues that applying a rigorous, explorative, diagnostic approach to ‘reading cities’ provides confidence that all critical challenges have been identified and, crucially, identifies how they are interdependent, both of which have implications for how policymakers and decision-makers address a particular city's combination of interlinked challenges. © 2018 The Authors",,"decision making; integrated approach; policy making; urban design; urban development; urban planning; urban policy; Birmingham [Birmingham (DST)]; Birmingham [England]; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055049382

Therefore, the drivers of carbon prices need to be disentangled to analyze the price formation process, which is important for both policy makers and investors. By applying the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, we decompose the historical carbon price data of the five ETS pilots in China into five groups of the independent Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) sequences and the residue, respectively. Then, the IMFs and the residue in each pilot are reconstructed into a high frequency component, a low frequency component and a trend component, thus disentangling the effects of short-term market fluctuations, significant events, and the long-term trend. The main findings are as follows. First, the IMF with a period around one year is the most influential factor, which reflects that pilots are characterized by the yearly cycle. Second, significant events have greater impacts than short-term market fluctuations, and are the dominant driver in Shanghai and Beijing pilots. Third, the long-term trend plays a decisive role in Shenzhen, Guangdong and Hubei pilots.

Design/methodology/approach: Separate interview questionnaires for 3DP users and 3DP service providers were used to conduct semi-structured interviews. Findings: The key 3DP adoption challenges are as follows: creating a business case; difficulty in using different materials; optimising the process for specific parts; lack of “plug and play” solutions offered by equipment manufacturers; limited availability of training and educational support; poor end product quality; machine breakdowns; and high cost of maintenance and spare components. Using the theoretical lens of the technology acceptance model, results show a lack of ease of use and technological turbulence impact companies’ decisions to adopt 3DP. 3DP service providers can indeed attempt to alleviate the above challenges faced by customers through providing multiple 3DP services across different stages of adoption. Research limitations/implications: Future research should examine the role of 3DP equipment manufacturers and design and modeling software solutions providers in improving adoption and how 3DP equipment manufacturers could develop into more integrated service providers as the technology advances. Practical implications: Service providers can help customers transition to 3DP and should develop a portfolio of services that fits different phases of adoption.

Existing managerial studies have not fully addressed individual perceptions of BIM implementation, especially architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) students' opinions related to BIM implementation or industry practice. As future industry professionals, AEC students' perceptions and expectations have not been compared with those of industry professionals. Adopting the student population from Swinburne University of Technology as the case study, this research initiated a questionnaire-based approach followed by statistical analysis. In all, responses of 257 AEC students to three major perception-based categories, namely BIM's usefulness, students' desired BIM-related jobs, and challenges during BIM implementation, were collected. The overall sample analysis revealed that students favored BIM-based jobs related to engineering design and project management, and they perceived less usefulness of BIM in assisting facility management and quantity surveying. Subgroup analysis showed that certain perceptions in BIM practice would be affected by students' field of study, prior industry experience, and gender. For example, male students generally held more positive views on BIM's applicability and usefulness. AEC students in this study showed certain discernment in identifying certain contemporary BIM-related practices. However, they also had different views on challenges compared to industry professionals due to AEC students having less industry experience. In-depth discussions were provided on how these subgroup factors affected students' perceptions. This empirical study of student perceptions in BIM practice provides insights to both BIM educators and AEC employers in terms of optimizing BIM education resources between industry practice and academic research, awareness of subgroup differences in their perceptions and motivations, and similarities and differences between AEC students and industry practitioners.

This, in turn, affects the economic development of the port city or region. Given the fast-changing global environment, forecasting the container throughput of a port is of vital importance. There are many existing time series forecasting methods, which can be used to forecast a port's container throughput. However, there is limited research comparing the performance of different commonly employed methods on the same time series. This study attempts to bridge this gap. This paper first presents several time series forecasting methods, including machine learning-based methods such as Support Vector Regression.

While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts >1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of >1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events. Furthermore, we find that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost due to its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Turbidity prediction; Water quality","Decision support systems; Decision trees; Environmental protection; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Potable water; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Analytics; Complex environmental systems; Decision support tools; Generalised linear models; Machine learning techniques; Nephelometric turbidity units; Nonlinear interactions; Water treatment works; Water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062642158

We use semi-variance of the possible profit values as a measure of the retailer’s risk attitude. We first study the setting where the supplier can observe the risk type of the retailer and find that in this case the supplier can design a buyback contract that extracts the maximum profit for the supplier. When the retailer’s type is unobservable, a new contract needs to be designed (the ‘option buyback contract’) and we show that in this case the retailers will self-select and chose an order quantity that maximises the total supply chain profit. Through numerical computations, we analyse the dynamics between the benefits of hedging risk, information rent and the retailer’s type, and outline cases when, depending on the shape of the reservation utilities of the retailers, it is too costly for the supplier to manage risk. In conclusion, our results show that whereas semi-variance has appealing properties as a measure of risk, its use introduces analytical challenges that can only be overcome through numerical computation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","buyback contracts; put option; risk management; semi-variance; supply chain management","Profitability; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sales; Analytical challenge; Buy-back contracts; Demand uncertainty; Information asymmetry; Numerical computations; Put options; Reservation utilities; Semi-variances; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052307216

Some prior research has shown that many people are generally not willing to fly in fully autonomous aircraft; however, there is a significant proportion of society that is willing to use these types of airplanes. It is critical for the aviation industry to be able to identify these individuals as they will likely be the early adopters. The current study was designed with the purpose of determining what factors predict the type of person who would be willing to fly in fully autonomous commercial airplanes. We provided a hypothetical scenario to 1042 potential passengers from the United States and asked them to rate their willingness to fly in that situation. We also collected demographic data, along with ratings of various scales to determine what predictors were significant in a regression model. In Stage 1, we built the model from a dataset of 522 participants and determined that the significant factors were familiarity with autonomous flight, fun factor, general wariness of new technology, happiness, fear, age, and educational level. This model accounted for 85.9% of the variance in the data. In Stage 2, we tested the model with 520 participants and found excellent model fit.

As a result, the existing solution approaches for this problem class typically determine suboptimal solutions under restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we propose a robust dual dynamic programming (RDDP) scheme for multistage robust optimization problems. The RDDP scheme takes advantage of the decomposable nature of these problems by bounding the costs arising in the future stages through lower and upper cost-to-go functions. For problems with uncertain technology matrices and/or constraint right-hand sides, our RDDP scheme determines an optimal solution in finite time. Also, if the objective function and/or the recourse matrices are uncertain, our method converges asymptotically (but deterministically) to an optimal solution. Our RDDP scheme does not require a relatively complete recourse, and it offers deterministic upper and lower bounds throughout the execution of the algorithm. We show the promising performance of our algorithm in a stylized inventory management problem. © 2019 INFORMS.","Dual dynamic programming; Error bounds; Multistage problems; Robust optimization","Decision making; Error analysis; Inventory control; Optimal systems; Uncertainty analysis; Computational challenges; Dual dynamic programming; Error bound; Inventory management; Multi-stage problem; Robust optimization; Suboptimal solution; Upper and lower bounds; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068485910

Recent studies on the business value of information technology (BVIT) investments have focused on understanding IT's impact on firm performance, either in the context of other organizational resources or in the light of contingency factors. This study extends the prior literature by integrating these two perspectives and examining the BVIT while simultaneously considering other organizational resources and one important contingency factor-environmental turbulence. We develop a contingent interaction model, proposing that a firm's IT interacts differently with a resource focused on fostering innovation (i.e., research and development [R & D]) and a resource focused on enhancing the competitive gains in the market (i.e., advertising), depending on the extent of environmental turbulence in its industry. Specifically, we hypothesize that as the extent of environmental turbulence in a firm's industry increases, the positive effect of the interaction between IT and R & D investments on firm performance increases, but the positive effect of the interaction between IT and advertising investments on firm performance decreases. Our findings, based on a longitudinal sample of 294 firms observed from 1999 to 2008 and collected from three archival sources (InformationWeek, COMPUSTAT, and CRSP) provide evidence that supports the proposed hypotheses. Additionally, the results of a splitsample analysis reveal that the interaction between IT and R & D has a positive effect on firm performance in turbulent environments but a negative effect in stable environments. Conversely, the interaction between IT and advertising has a negative effect on firm performance in turbulent environments but a positive effect in stable environments. Put together, these findings indicate that a firm's IT interacts differently with other organizational resources depending on (a) the resource's focus on value creation through innovation or value appropriation in themarket; and (b) the extent of turbulence in the firm's industry. This paper discusses the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings in detail. © 2019, INFORMS.","Advertising; Environmental turbulence; Information technology investment; R & D; Resource interaction; Value appropriation; Value creation","Investments; Marketing; Turbulence; Environmental turbulences; Information technology investments; Resource interaction; Value appropriation; Value creation; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065451972

The estimated results using a quantile approach show significant selection effects for 15 out of 29 sectors. We find that provinces above the median employment density weed out approximately two to eight percent more firms than those below the median density. Further, market size tends to generate greater selection effects in the sectors with stronger local protections, scale economies or product differentiation.

In particular, considering a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer, we identify four modes: the manufacturer solely invests, the retailer solely invests, or both firms collaboratively or independently invest to reduce the manufacturer's production cost. A question that arises naturally is which one is preferred by the manufacturer, the retailer, and the chain. With iso-elastic demand being sensitive to retail price and sales effort, we define channel powers (in addition to cost factors) for both firms to characterize the firms' investments and identify the best mode. We show that both firms are better off by investing collaboratively rather than independently if and only if the two firms have comparable channel powers and comparable cost factors. Moreover, a firm prefers to invest by itself solely rather than invest by its partner or both firms collaboratively if and only if its cost factor is sufficiently smaller than its partner's. We apply our results to supplier development and get some new insights. As a byproduct, the retailer may get less from the chain profit, which contradicts the retailer-dominant property in the literature under consignment contracts with revenue sharing.

Using new books released simultaneously in e-book and print formats in March and June 2010 as the control group, we find that delaying e-book availability results in a 43.8% decrease in e-book sales but no increase in print book sales on Amazon.com or among other online or offline retailers. We also find that the decrease in e-book sales is greater for books with less prerelease buzz. Together, we find no evidence of strong cannibalization between print books and e-books in the short term and no support for the sequential distribution of books in print versions followed by e-book versions.

Academics (data hunters) have to deal with decreasing respondent participation and escalating costs of data collection while at the same time seeking to increase the managerial relevance of their research. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework on how, managers and academics can collaborate better to leverage each other’s resources. Design/methodology/approach: This research synthesizes the academic and the managerial literature on the realities and priorities of practitioners and academics with regard to data. Based on the literature, reflections from the world’s leading service research centers, and the authors’ own experiences, the authors develop recommendations on how to collaborate in research. Findings: Four dimensions of different data realities and priorities were identified: research problem, research resources, research process and research outcome. In total, 26 recommendations are presented that aim to equip academics to leverage the potential of corporate data for research purposes and to help managers to leverage research results for their business. Research limitations/implications: This paper argues that both practitioners and academics have a lot to gain from collaborating by exchanging corporate data for scientific approaches and insights. However, the gap between different realities and priorities needs to be bridged when doing so. The paper first identifies data realities and priorities and then develops recommendations on how to best collaborate given these differences. Practical implications: This research has the potential to contribute to managerial practice by informing academics on how to better collaborate with the managerial world and thereby facilitate collaboration and the dissemination of academic research for the benefit of both parties. Originality/value: Whereas the previous literature has primarily examined practitioner–academic collaboration in general, this study is the first to focus specifically on the aspects related to sharing corporate data and to elaborate on academic and corporate objectives with regard to data and insights. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data; Data capture; Management; Research; Service",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074693636

We argue that as the governance leaders of their firms, board chairs choose a firm's objectives more than they do its actions. As a result, the board chair effect should vary with latitude of objectives, rather than latitude of actions. We explore this possibility by comparing the board chair effect in two countries with relatively high latitude of objectives—Germany and China—with the board chair effect in two countries with relatively low latitude of objectives—the United States and United Kingdom. Results confirm that latitude of objectives influences the effect of board chair heterogeneity on firm performance. Managerial Summary: Do board chairs matter to different degrees in different countries? Building on prior work showing that U.S. board chairs account for a significant portion of firm performance, we collected data on board chairs from four different countries to find out if this effect differs by institutional environment. We find that board chairs matter for firm performance across countries, but that board chairs in Germany and China exhibit a considerably larger effect on firm performance than do board chairs in the United States and United Kingdom. We interpret these findings as evidence that board chairs enjoy wider discretion with regard to organizational objectives in Germany and China than they do in the United States and United Kingdom. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","board chair effect; corporate governance; cross-country comparison; institutional environment; variance decomposition","Planning; board chair effect; Corporate governance; Country comparisons; institutional environment; Variance decomposition; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070675620

Whether these lean inventory developments translate to better retailer operational performance is still an open question. We empirically examine associations between inventory leanness and operational efficiency for a sample of public US retailers from 2000 to 2013. Via a stochastic frontier analysis that accounts for retailer heterogeneity and time parameters, we find support for the hypothesis that operational efficiency has an inverted U-shape relationship with inventory leanness, suggesting an optimal inventory leanness level beyond which retailer operational efficiency degrades. This relationship, however, is heavily moderated by firm size and demand uncertainty. The former reflects a retailer's abilities to exploit economies of scale and scope, whereas the latter reflects the unpredictability in a firm's operating environment. Our evidence suggests that when increasing inventory leanness, small retailers exhibit efficiency degradation, whereas larger retailers are likely to exhibit efficiency improvement, with diminishing returns. We also find that under high demand uncertainty, being less lean is associated with higher operational efficiency, regardless of firm size. The findings show that depending on firm size and demand uncertainty, retail managers should take special care when pursuing inventory leanness. As part of post hoc robustness tests, we assess how different retail categories vary in their operational efficiency scores and conduct interviews with retail executives who further ground our econometric investigation and point to more nuanced moderators for future studies. We conclude by discussing the implications of our industry model estimation for managers and researchers. © 2019 Production and Operations Management Society","efficiency; inventory; lean; retailing; stochastic frontier analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067387445

This model accommodates various types of responses and embraces many important problem setups such as reduced-rank regression, matrix regression that accommodates a panel of regressors, matrix completion, among others. We estimate Θ∗ through minimizing empirical negative log-likelihood plus nuclear norm penalty. We first establish a general theory and then for each specific problem, we derive explicitly the statistical rate of the proposed estimator. They all match the minimax rates in the linear trace regression up to logarithmic factors. Numerical studies confirm the rates we established and demonstrate the advantage of generalized trace regression over linear trace regression when the response is dichotomous.

It holds promise to yield outcomes that exceed the sum of its subparts. Measuring emergence for a TC environment can inform innovation management. This paper suggests a novel approach to identify Emergent Topics (ETopics) of the TC environment within a target technology domain using patent information. A non-TC environment is constructed as a comparison group. First, TC is operationalized as a co-classification of a given patent into multiple 4-digit IPC codes (≥2-IPC). We take a set of patents and parse those into three sub-datasets based on the number of IPC codes assigned 1-IPC (Non-TC), 2-IPC and ≥3-IPC. Second, a method is applied to identify emergent terms (ETs) and calculate emergence score for each term in each sub-dataset. Finally, we cluster those ETs using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to generate a factor map with ETopics. A convergent domain – 3D printing – is selected to present the illustrative results. Results affirm that for 3D printing, emergent topics in TC patents are distinctly different from those in non-TC patents. The number of ETs in the TC environment is increasing annually. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","3D printing; Emergent Terms (ETs); Emergent Topics (ETopics); International Patent Classification (IPC); Technological Convergence (TC)","Patents and inventions; Principal component analysis; 3-D printing; Emergent Terms (ETs); Emergent Topics (ETopics); International patents; Technological convergence; 3D printers; data set; innovation; management; technological development; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059200792

This regulatory scheme is known to provide cost-reduction incentives and serves as the theoretical underpinning behind the hospital prospective reimbursement system used throughout the developed world. This paper uses a game-theoretic queueing model to investigate how yardstick competition performs in service systems (e.g., hospital emergency departments), where in addition to incentivizing cost reduction the regulator wants to incentivize waiting time reduction. We first show that the form of cost-based yardstick competition used in practice results in inefficiently long waiting times. We then demonstrate how yardstick competition can be appropriately modified to achieve the dual goal of cost and waiting-time reduction. In particular, we show that full efficiency (first-best) can be restored if the regulator makes the providers' reimbursement contingent on their service rates and is also able to charge a provider-specific “toll” to consumers. More important, if such a toll is not feasible, as may be the case in healthcare, we show that there exists an alternative and particularly simple yardstick-competition scheme, which depends on the average waiting time only, that can significantly improve system efficiency (second-best). This scheme is easier to implement because it does not require the regulator to have detailed knowledge of the queueing discipline. We conclude with a numerical investigation that provides insights on the practical implementation of yardstick competition for hospital emergency departments, and we also present a series of modelling extensions. © 2019 INFORMS.","Emergency care; Game theory; Hospital regulation; Queueing theory; Yardstick competition","Efficiency; Emergency rooms; Game theory; Queueing theory; Average waiting-time; Emergency care; Hospital emergency departments; In-service systems; Numerical investigations; Queueing discipline; Regulatory schemes; Yardstick competition; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069440836

It is based on primary data from environmental emissions, wastewater, chemical components, and manufacturing of PIL based devices. The results indicate that the printing process does not significantly exacerbate the environmental impacts. However, it is shown that excellent opportunities for further mitigation of the life cycle impacts of PILs can be realised are by practising reagent recovery, which reduces the amount of reagents emitted as waste, and by reduction/recycling of solvents used for cleaning the 3D part. The major impact contributor in the 3D-printing of PILs is the synthesis of the IL monomers. The effective reduction of solvent consumption and recovery significantly improves the impact of the synthetic process. This work focuses on the employment of the 3-butyl-1-vinylimidazolium [BVim] cation, with the non-coordinating and hydrophobic bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide [NTf 2 ] - anion as the counter anion. The polymerisable monomer IL has comparable impact compared to the analogous non-polymerisable 3-butyl-1-methylimidazolium [NTf 2 ] - ionic liquid, thus potentially allowing for the more efficient use of the ionic liquid properties by immobilization in solid phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that switching the anion from [NTf 2 ] - to dicyanamide [N(CN 2 )] - significantly decreases the impacts in all categories evaluated for PIL production. This work represents the first phase toward quantitative LCA data generation for the process of 3D-printing ionic liquids, which will be great support for decision making during design of PIL 3D-printing processes at a laboratory scale. © 2018","3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Ionic liquids; Life cycle assessment; Polymers; Stereolithography","Decision making; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Ionic liquids; Ions; Life cycle; Monomers; Polymers; Printing presses; Stereolithography; 3-D printing; 3D printing process; Chemical component; Environmental emissions; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impacts; Solvent consumption; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060009450

Second, we introduce own and spillover allocative efficiency growth components. Third, we provide a more detailed coverage of the spatial decomposition of TFP growth. Fourth, in contrast to the traditional application to geographical areas (e.g., countries) in the relevant literature, we apply our decomposition using firm level data, which suggests that there can be an important role for spatial productivity analysis in OR. Our application is to large U.S. banks over the period 1992–2015.

Drawing on Bourdieu's forms of capital and the logic of digital options, we develop an integrative conceptual framework to identify and organize antecedents of digital advantage, which can translate to hospital performance through the creation of digital options. Focusing on the antecedents of digital advantage for our research model and hypotheses, we suggest that digital advantage is influenced by (1) economic capital, (2) institutional-arrangement-based social capital that results in knowledge sharing through information exchange networks and parent organization membership, (3) geographic-proximity-based social capital due to locational externalities that facilitate knowledge spillover, and (4) cultural capital that reflects the hospital's health information technology (HIT) knowledge stock. Our findings, based on the aggregate adoption of 90 HITs by 953 hospitals, support main effects; complementary effects of the two forms of social capital; and substitutive effects between (1) economic capital and other forms of capital such that cultural capital and both types of social capital mitigate the effects of inadequate economic capital, and between (2) institutionalarrangement- based social capital and cultural capital such that knowledge shared through institutional arrangements mitigates the effects of having inadequate in-house HIT expertise. We also provide preliminary evidence to show that hospital digital advantage is positively associated with hospital performance. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

Since EMS is a public service, it is natural for the community to expect equitable service from these systems; however, there is not a unique agreement on how to measure equity. Most EMS planning literature focuses solely on measures of efficiency, such as minimizing average response time. Solutions based on optimizing efficiency measures alone can be unacceptable when they are achieved at the expense of some players. Such trade-offs can be more crucial when it comes to high-priority emergencies. We provide a multicriteria optimization approach aimed at identifying good solutions for several equity and efficiency measures together, based on a joint modeling approach for location and dispatching policy decisions, while considering multiple levels of call priority. We apply our approach to a real-world data set. We show that the joint approach provides better solutions than using the common assignment of the closest available ambulance, in particular for the equity criteria. We quantify the trade-offs between different performance measures, and provide Pareto-efficient solutions. The proposed joint optimization approach can be used to gain insight about the implicit balance between common efficiency measures and discussed equity criteria, hence providing better information to policy makers and EMS system administrators. © 2018 The Authors.

These newer methods explicitly allow statistical noise in the model, the absence of which is a common criticism of the data envelopment estimator. Further, several of these newer methods have focused on ensuring that axioms of production hold. These models and their subsequent estimators, despite having many appealing features, have yet to appear regularly in empirical research. Given the pace at which estimators of this style are being proposed, coupled with the dearth of formal applications, we seek to review the literature and discuss practical implementation issues of these methods.

In these problems, make-to-order products are first processed in a plant and then delivered to customer sites through two stages of shipping: first, from the plant to a pool point (e.g., a port, a distribution, or a consolidation center) and, second, from the pool point to customer sites. The objective is to obtain a joint schedule of job processing at the plant and two-stage shipping of completed jobs to customer sites to optimize a performance measure that takes into account both delivery timeliness and total transportation costs. We consider two problems in which delivery timeliness is measured by total or maximum lead time of the jobs and study both offline and online versions of these problems. For the offline problems involving a single production line at the plant, we provide optimal dynamic programming algorithms. For the more general offline problems involving multiple production lines at the plant, we propose fast heuristics and analyze their worst-case and asymptotic performances. For the online problems, we propose online algorithms and analyze their competitive ratios. By comparing our offline heuristics with lower bounds using randomly generated test instances, it is shown that these heuristics are capable of generating near-optimal solutions quickly. Using real data from Baosteel’s Meishan plant, we also show that our corresponding offline heuristic generates significantly better solutions than Baosteel’s rule-based approach. In addition, our computational results on the performance of the online algorithms relative to the offline heuristics generate important methodological insights that can be used by practitioners in choosing a specific solution approach.

Second, the proposed commodity-based model for stock returns outperforms both the time series models as well as historical average models that ignore same. Third, these conclusions are robust to different components of commodity prices, multiple data samples and alternative forecast horizons. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Commodity prices; G7 countries; Predictive model; Stock returns","Costs; Forecasting; Investments; Commodity prices; Conditional heteroscedasticity; G7 countries; Out-of-sample forecast; Predictive modeling; Stock returns; Structural break; Time series models; Financial markets; asymmetry; commodity price; G-7 country; model; persistence; prediction; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074272291

We begin to unpack the role of unemployment duration in necessity entrepreneurship by asking how it affects one of the most fundamental decisions in start-ups: “what business should I be in?” Analyzing primary data on 576 necessity entrepreneurs combined with three secondary data sets, we find that unemployment duration affects whether ventures are launched in “home” or in external industries, and moderates the extent to which founders' industry experience and the attractiveness of external opportunities relative to those in the “home” industry shape industry choice. Managerial Summary: Necessity entrepreneurs—individuals who create new firms because they have no other options for work—represent a substantial proportion of world-wide entrepreneurial activity, and, in developed countries, often come from the ranks of the unemployed. We analyze these entrepreneurs by answering the question “what business should I be in?,” a fundamental strategic decision that founders make. Our findings reveal that duration in unemployment is a key, hitherto unexamined factor that systematically affects the industry-choice decision in startups. Moreover, we find that duration of unemployment moderates the founder's industry experience and the attractiveness of external opportunities relative to those in the “home” industry, with a markedly different picture for the long-term unemployed—suggesting the need for customized government policies for formerly unemployed entrepreneurs. © 2019 The Authors.

The seller sequentially observes past demand, updates model parameters, and then chooses the price for the next period based on time-varying features. We show that model misspecification leads to a correlation between price and prediction error of demand per period, which, in turn, leads to inconsistent price elasticity estimates and hence suboptimal pricing decisions. We propose a “random price shock” (RPS) algorithm that dynamically generates randomized price shocks to estimate price elasticity, while maximizing revenue. We show that the RPS algorithm has strong theoretical performance guarantees, that it is robust to model misspecification, and that it can be adapted to a number of business settings, including (1) when the feasible price set is a price ladder and (2) when the contextual information is not IID.

Extant research indicates that this situation entails a paradoxical tension: individuals feel compelled to continue the failing course, while also feeling pulled to respond to its negative feedback. I argue that individuals with a paradox mindset (i.e., the extent to which they accept and are energized by tensions) will respond to the situation by developing a sense of optimism about being able to successfully work through it. Four experiments demonstrate that a paradox mindset is associated with optimism and persistence with a failing course. However, these relationships are largely attenuated in situations where an alternative course of action is salient.

The study used a longitudinal qualitative approach comprising twenty-two semi-structured interviews with eleven Portuguese consumers. The research was conducted in two moments in time: 2014 and 2018, corresponding to periods of Portuguese recession and recovery. The results show that, during recessions, consumers look for economic level-headedness, adopting and assuming new behaviors that allow them to accommodate the reduced income, which also translates into increased social responsibility. Besides switching to cheaper options, namely looking for private labels and national brand promotions, consumers revealed new strategies and new habits, such as i) more organization and planned behavior; ii) going shopping more frequently; iii) reducing stocking behavior, and iv) avoiding wasting. The study expands the comprehension of consumer behavior during recessions and recovery, bringing the idea of crises as ‘learning journeys’ and transformational opportunities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behavior; Consumption; Economic crisis; Longitudinal; Recession; Recovery","consumption behavior; decision making; economic instability; planning practice; qualitative analysis; savings behavior; shopping activity; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066142660

In China, coal is expected to retain its primary energy position over the next few decades. However, a large share of CO2 emissions and other environmental hazards, such as SO2 and NOx, are attributed to coal consumption. Therefore, understanding the environmental implications of the life cycle of coal from its production in coal mines to its consumption at coal-fired power plants is an essential task. Evaluation of such environmental burdens can be conducted using the life cycle assessment (LCA)tool. The main issues with the traditional LCA results are the lack of a numerical magnitude associated with the performance level of the obtained environmental burden values and the inherent uncertainty associated with the output results. This issue was addressed in this research by integrating the traditional LCA methodology with a weighted fuzzy inference system model, which is applied to a Chinese coal-to-energy supply chain system to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness. Regarding the coal-to-energy supply chain under investigation, the CCEP environmental performance has been determined as “medium performance”, with an indicator score of 39.15%. Accordingly, the decision makers suggested additional scenarios (redesign, equipment replacement, etc.)to improve the performance. A scenario-based analysis was designed to identify alternative paths to mitigate the environmental impact of the coal-to-energy supply chain. Finally, limitations and possible future work are discussed, and the conclusions are presented. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coal consumption and energy production; Coal-to-energy supply chain; Environmental performance indicator; Fuzzy inference system; Life cycle analysis","Benchmarking; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Coal mines; Decision making; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Mine power plants; Supply chains; Energy productions; Energy supply chains; Environmental performance indicators; Fuzzy inference systems; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle; coal mine; coal production; coal-fired power plant; energy resource; fuzzy mathematics; life cycle analysis; article; coal mining; electric power plant; energy yield; environmental impact; fuzzy system; life cycle assessment; uncertainty; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064647742

In this paper we argue that this assumption may not be suitable in applications in which some inputs or outputs are closely related to each other. Assuming strong disposability of such closely related measures may lead to unrealistic input and output profiles, and result in meaningless efficiency scores. Examples include inputs and outputs that are strongly correlated, represent overlapping measures or situations in which one measure is a subset of another. In this paper we develop production technologies that allow the specification of groups of closely related inputs and outputs which are only jointly weakly disposable. This assumption does not change the existing proportions between the closely related measures in the same group.

Dynamic information is frequently unable to reflect the whole characteristic when determining the exact data. In this study, we select interval data to represent the dynamic information of some variables in the evaluation process.

We study the role of social ties in motivating user preference expression, a form of user content contribution, in an online social media community. We examine the role of three types of ties, reciprocated, follower, and followee ties, and assess whether the structural and relational properties of a user's social network moderate the social influence effect in user contribution. A unique disaggregate level panel data set of users' contributions and social tie formation activities from an online music platform is employed to study the impact of social ties. To address identification issues, we adopt a quasi-experimental approach based on dynamic propensity score matching. The results provide strong evidence of the influence of online network ties in online contribution behavior. We find that the influence of reciprocated ties is the greatest, followed by influence from followee ties and then follower ties. Additional analysis reveals that reciprocated and followee ties have even greater influence when they contribute new information for a focal user. Structural embeddedness and tie strength among network ties are found to amplify the effect of social contagion in online contribution. We conduct several sensitivity and robustness checks that lend credible support to our findings. The results add to the greater understanding of social influence in online contribution and provide valuable managerial insights into designs of online communities to enable greater user participation.

It addresses two significant gaps in the literature. While prior research has advanced the understanding of how factors around tie strength, resource mobilization, and environmental characteristics relate to new product development, it has yet to offer a more holistic understanding of the interconnected structures and the interplay among these factors. Furthermore, limited insights exist about how firms could utilize resource mobilization approaches in different environmental contexts to enhance new product success. Building on resource dependence theory, this paper contributes to prior work by adopting configuration theoretical considerations and performing an empirical investigation to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for new product success. Based on data from a survey of 354 managers from manufacturing and services firms in the United Kingdom, the study conducts a configurational comparative study based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine configurations of strong-tie and weak-tie resource mobilization approaches within particular environmental contexts for new product success. The findings reveal alternative, equifinal configurations for new product success, and add to the existing body of work by connecting the notions of network ties, resource mobilization, and context dependence, as well as by developing an integrative framework to explain the interplay of remote and proximate conditions for new product success.

Return timing and quantity forecasts help estimate net demand (demand minus returns) requirements. Based on a unique data set of serialized transactional issues and returns from the Excelitas Group and one of their defense contractors, Qioptiq, we assess the empirical performance of some key methods in the area of returns forecasting. We extend their application (for net demand forecasting), by considering that demand is also subject to uncertainty and thus needs to be forecast. Information on remanufacturing costs allows for an evaluation of the inventory implications of such forecasts under various settings. A foray into the literature on information technologies enables a discussion on the interface between information availability and forecast accuracy and utility. We find that serialization accounts for considerable forecast accuracy benefits, and that the accuracy of demand forecasts is as important as that of returns. Further, we show how the combined returns and demand forecast uncertainty affects the inventory performance. Finally, we identify opportunities for further improvements for the operations of Qioptiq, and for remanufacturing operations in general. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","empirical data; forecasting; remanufacturing; simulation","Industrial engineering; Operations research; Defense contractor; Demand forecasting; Empirical data; Empirical performance; Information availability; Inventory performance; remanufacturing; simulation; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067010394

Using an online survey of venture capitalists, the article considers their networking behaviour, focusing particularly on the distinction between those employed by private and those employed by publicly backed venture capital funds, and on the composition and spatial search of their networks. It investigates whether the frequency of interaction between venture capitalists and other members of the innovation ecosystem is associated with the nature of the venture capital funds. The paper provides the first detailed investigation of the relationship between different types of venture capitalists and other players of the innovation ecosystem such as universities incubators, research institutes, and business support organisations. The results show that there are distinctive differences within the two seemingly similar professional groups (private and public venture capitalists), and public dependence of the venture capital fund is strongly and significantly associated with higher volumes of interactions. The more publicly dependent a fund is, the more it interacts with other players of the innovation system. This finding has important implications for both academics and practitioners and suggests that publicly backed funds have a wider role to play in mobilising the different players of the regional innovation ecosystem. © 2017, The Author(s).","Networks; Publicly policy; Regional development; Venture capital","Investments; Networks (circuits); Regional planning; Business support; Innovation system; Professional groups; Regional development; Regional innovation; Research institutes; Venture Capital; Venture capitalists; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029168005

This decision process involves, among other thing, obtaining a ranking of alternatives to support the decision. However, in many decision-making models the use of data is done without considering important aspects such as consistency or contextualization, which causes the results to be questioned in a general way due to lack of rigor in the decision-making. In this work, a decision-making model is proposed to obtain an alternative ranking contextualizing the feelings/opinions of the users represented through intervals of feeling consistent, using data obtained from the social media. This model uses an interval majority aggregation operator, which constructs opinion intervals using data extracted from the social media; a consistency index for pairwise-comparison interval matrices; an algorithm to reconstruct consistent interval pairwise-comparison matrices, by means of a deflationary process of intervals’ diameter; and an operator to obtain a ranking of alternatives in the interval pairwise-comparison matrices.

This paper explicitly distinguishes the association of mortality with macroeconomic fluctuations from that with fiscal policy measures, using data for 28 European Union (EU) countries covering the period 1991–2013. The main results present a nuanced, complex picture about the mortality impact of fiscal policies. We confirm the mortality decreasing (increasing) effect of recessions (booms), with the exception of suicide mortality, which shows the opposite effects. Austerity regimes are associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (0.7%). At the same time, fiscal stimuli tend to significantly increase death rates due to cirrhosis or chronic liver disease (3%) and those due to vehicle accidents (4.3%). Our results are sensitive to the set of countries included: when excluding the Baltics, Romania and Hungary, austerity policies turn out to significantly increase suicide-related mortality (2.8%), while the effect on all-cause mortality remains unaffected (0.7%). Overall, however it appears that the austerity-increasing effects are mostly compensated by the (mostly) mortality-decreasing effects of recessions. A notable exception appears to be suicides, which receive a ‘double-boost’ from both recessions and austerity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Austerity; Recession and health; Socioeconomic determinants of health","all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic liver disease; health care policy; human; infection; liver cirrhosis; mortality rate; neoplasm; suicide; traffic accident; adolescent; adult; child; economics; epidemiology; Europe; female; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; policy; preschool child; young adult; Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Economics; Europe; Female; Humans; Infant; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Policy; Suicide; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064258638

For quantitative analysis, partial least square structural equation modelling technique was utilised. The results confirmed that project planning had a statistically significant impact on project success. Furthermore, risk management significantly moderated the relationship between project planning and project success in the construction businesses despite being in two different economies. The paper contributes to the enhancement of the body of knowledge intended for global companies and academicians aiming to implement risk management frameworks to enhance project success and ensure the effectiveness of project planning in a competitive business environment. It offers a new perspective to investigate the relationship between project planning and project success through moderating the effect of risk management, which is a new theoretical dimension for construction business and the field of project management.

This research proposes a novel two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that employs frontier-shift methodology to measure ESC ecological efficiency when carbon permits are tradable. The proposed frontier-shift DEA (FSDEA) approach uses the carbon trading quantitative information to determine to whom the trade should be made and how much to trade. In addition to estimating ESC efficiency performance, this research also stipulates the efforts required for a particular decision-making units (DMU) to become efficient and discuss the benefits that derived from the proposed exchange. It also reveals why certain DMUs are more likely involved in trading than others. Under the two-stage ESC, this research shows that either stage can improve the overall efficiency, which can be optimally derived if and only if both stages obtain the optimal solutions. In an application study of cities in one of the Chinese provinces, the proposed FSDEA model compares each city's potential percentage efficiency improvement with minimal possible efforts (carbon reduction), which differs from existing DEA models that rank solely by efficiency scores. Results show that on average the amount of carbon credits a city should trade to its competitors is 392.21 tons, resulting in a 6.61% improvement in efficiency. Among cities, Xuancheng and Fuyang is ranked in the first and the last place, respectively, according to their effectiveness in potential efficiency improvement with possible reduction efforts. Our findings offer valuable insights into ESC efficiency and help businesses make advantageous ecological decisions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon credits trading; Ecological efficiency; Energy supply chain; Frontier-shift; Two-stage DEA","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Emission control; Energy resources; Supply chains; Carbon credits; Ecological efficiency; Energy supply chains; Frontier-shift; Two-stage; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057893453

However, practitioners might target shoppers who have short-listed products in their digital carts without fully considering how ECT designs interact with consumer mindsets in online shopping stages. This paper develops a conceptual model of ECT that addresses the question of when (with versus without carts) and how to target (scarcity versus price promotion). Our ECT model is grounded in the consumer goal stage theory of deliberative or implemental mindsets and supported by a two-stage field experiment involving more than 22,000 mobile users. The results indicate that ECT has a substantial impact on consumer purchases, inducing a 29.9% higher purchase rate than e-commerce targeting without carts. Moreover, this incremental impact is moderated: the ECT design with a price incentive amplifies the impact, but the same price incentive leads to ineffective e-commerce targeting without carts. By contrast, a scarcity message attenuates the impact but significantly boosts purchase responses to targeting without carts. Interestingly, the costless scarcity nudge is approximately 2.3 times more effective than the costly price incentive in the early shopping stage without carts, whereas a price incentive is 11.4 times more effective than the scarcity message in the late stage with carts. We also leverage a causal forest algorithm that can learn purchase response heterogeneity to develop a practical scheme of optimizing ECT. Our model and findings empower managers to prudently target consumer shopping interests embedded in digital carts to capitalize on new opportunities in e-commerce.

I document that an increase in the importance of general managerial human capital can account for this change. The level of general skills, measured by the type of education and occupational mobility of managers, correlate with higher pay and turnover. Other factors may have also contributed to these changes, but the labor market for managers has likely played an important role. © 2019 INFORMS.","Finance: corporate finance; Management; Organizational studies: personnel","Commerce; Employment; Management; Managers; Corporate executives; Corporate finance; Data set; Human capitals; Labor markets; Organizational studies; Stylized facts; Twentieth century; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075352310

In these cases, do firms promote the best potential manager or the best worker in their current job? Using microdata on the performance of sales workers at 131 firms, we find evidence consistent with the Peter Principle, which proposes that firms prioritize current job performance in promotion decisions at the expense of other observable characteristics that better predict managerial performance. We estimate that the costs of promoting workers with lower managerial potential are high, suggesting either that firms are making inefficient promotion decisions or that the benefits of promotion-based incentives are great enough to justify the costs of managerial mismatch. We find that firms manage the costs of the Peter Principle by placing less weight on sales performance in promotion decisions when managerial roles entail greater responsibility and when frontline workers are incentivized by strong pay for performance. © The Author(s) 2019.",,"decision making; incentive; management; marketing; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074767249

These are: (1) an open organisational culture derived from an open-mindedness attitude, (2) an organisation's investments in innovation in environmentally friendly and health-conscious products and services, and (3) customers' perception of risk of information security and privacy concerns derived from their engagement with the organisation and its products and services. Taking Apple as the basis for our study, an empirical investigation of 161 of its customers from a variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, our results indicate that a culture of open mindedness relates, indirectly and though environmental product innovation, to the way the firm addresses the privacy concerns of end users. This, in turn, helps addressing the privacy concerns of the customer base and, simultaneously improves firms' performance, offering a mix-blended source of strategic advantage. Based on a leading innovation company in the U.S. and globally, and one of the most important names in the technology industry, lessons can be learned from our study both for further theoretical developments and for management practice in a variety of knowledge-intensive, global enterprises. © 2019","Eco-innovation; Global enterprise; Open-mindedness; Organisational performance; Privacy concerns; Technology users","Health risks; Risk perception; Sales; Security of data; Sustainable development; Eco-innovation; Global Enterprises; Open-mindedness; Organisational performance; Privacy concerns; Economic analysis; industrial development; industrial investment; industrial performance; industrial technology; innovation; management practice; organization; sustainable development; United States; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071607209

In this study, we extend the existing corporate finance literature by examining the underexplored issue of how CEOs' market sentiment drives firms' investment decisions. Capitalising on a large sample of US firms for the period 2004–2014, we uncovered some crucial observations. First, we found empirical support for our theoretical contention that market sentiment drives corporate investment decisions. Second, we established that, while financial flexibility induces managers to overinvest, the expectation of future profitability leads firms to underinvest during high sentiment periods. In addition, we uncovered that the 2007/08 financial crisis significantly impacted firm behaviour and realigned managerial decision-making. Thus, the sentiment-investment relationship is more pronounced during the crisis and the post-crisis periods. Our results are robust after accounting for the possibility of endogeneity and using alternative measures of both CEOs' market sentiment and firm investment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Crisis; Flexibility; Investment; Market sentiment; Profitability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068911852

However, questions have also been raised about the consequences of the university-industry relationship and its impact on their traditional role. This paper contributes to this debate by exploring whether and how being efficient in generating income from engagement activities impacts on universities’ research performance. By using a sample of 119 UK higher educational institutions for period 2007–2014, and controlling for endogeneity issue, the results show that efficiency in terms of university-industry income and research performance exhibits a nonlinear relationship for both universities established before (“old universities”), and after (“new universities”), the Higher Education Act 1992 (HEA). However, for high level of efficiency, “old universities” do not appear able to improve their research performance further. Finally, positive synergies between the third mission and research mission decline in a more teaching-oriented environment. We conclude that policy makers should account for organisational heterogeneity and teaching orientation to promote research excellence effectively by stimulating engagement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Efficiency; Higher education institutions; Industry engagement; REF","Economics; Educational institutions; Higher education acts; Higher education institutions; Industry relationship; Non-linear relationships; Research performance; University industries; University-industry relationships; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065252863

We start evaluating each unit by means of weighted sums of their elementary indicators in the whole set of admissible weights. For each unit, we compute the mean, μ, and the standard deviation, σ, of its evaluations. Clearly, the former has to be maximized, while the latter has to be minimized as it denotes instability in the evaluations with respect to the variability of weights. We consider a unit to be Pareto–Koopmans efficient with respect to μ and σ if there is no convex combination of μ and σ of the rest of the units with a value of μ that is not smaller, and a value of σ that is not greater, with at least one strict inequality. The set of all Pareto–Koopmans efficient units constitutes the first Pareto–Koopmans frontier. In the spirit of context-dependent Data Envelopment Analysis, we assign each unit to one of the sequence of Pareto–Koopmans frontiers. We measure the local efficiency of each unit with respect to each frontier, but also its global efficiency taking into account all frontiers in the σ−μ plane, thus enhancing the explicative power of the proposed approach. To illustrate its potential, we present a case study of ‘world happiness’ based on the data of the homonymous report that is annually produced by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Composite indicators; Data envelopment analysis; neo-Benthamite approach; Sigma-Mu efficiency; Stochastic multiattribute acceptability analysis","Data envelopment analysis; Stochastic systems; Acceptability analysis; Composite indicators; Convex combinations; Efficiency analysis; Local efficiencies; neo-Benthamite approach; Performance analysis; Standard deviation; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065048439

In this study, we use text-based analysis, network visualizations, and topic modeling of nearly 60 000 venture business descriptions-i.e., how ventures present technologies and products to key stakeholders including customers, employees, and investors-to examine the structure of 35 global entrepreneurial ecosystems. Rather than using predefined industry classifications, we allow the structural configurations to emerge endogenously revealing a more variegated perspective of venture strategic positioning in entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our study makes several important contributions. First, by examining strategic positioning statements of geographically defined ventures, we contribute and advance our understanding of the geography of innovation and structure of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our results indicate that there are wide differences in entrepreneurial ecosystem size, structure, composition, and venture strategic positioning. Second, methodologically, we use novel computational approaches and introduce visualization as a powerful means to understand entrepreneurial ecosystems. Third, our results show that ventures from widely different industries often use similar position statements, thus highlighting that ecosystems are indeed not just defined by industries, but also strategic positioning.

Despite their beneficial values, the overall level of usage (take-up) remains relatively low compared to traditional modes. They are also challenging to evaluate due to behavioral, economical, political, and technical aspects. The literature lacks a methodology framework to guide the government transformation application to improve both internal processes of e-services and institutional transformation to advance relationships with stakeholders. This paper proposes a cognitive analytics management (CAM) framework to implement such transformations. The ambition is to increase users’ take-up rate and satisfaction, and create sustainable shared values through provision of improved e-services. The CAM framework uses cognition to understand and frame the transformation challenge into analytics terms. Analytics insights for improvements are generated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A classification and regression tree is then applied to DEA results to identify characteristics of satisfaction to advance relationships. The importance of senior management is highlighted for setting strategic goals and providing various executive supports. The CAM application for the transforming Turkish e-services is validated on a large sample data using online survey. The results are discussed; the outcomes and impacts are reported in terms of estimated savings of more than fifteen billion dollars over a ten-year period and increased usage of improved new e-services.

Then, considering sustainability dimensions, by integrating data envelopment analysis (DEA), game theory and sustainable UNDP, a bi-level model has been proposed for selecting and scheduling URCPs. A meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the presented bi-level model. Different test instances are solved to show the acceptable performance of proposed algorithm in both solution quality and execution time. Afterwards, the proposed model is applied to study the problem of urban road construction projects selection in a real-world case study of urban transportation network of Isfahan city in Iran.

However, the scenarios envisaged the rising role of gas, the strategic relevance of the gas transportation infrastructure, and the growing interventionism of the Russian government. The scenarios thus helped Shell's managers to adapt their strategic beliefs and ultimately enabled them to notice, assess, and respond successfully to external changes—even though these changes had not been foreseen in the scenarios.

This research seeks to assess whether or not the policy of technology transfer practised during the socialist era improved for these countries following their entry to a capitalist regime and their subsequent joining of the European Union, and whether or not these two processes (which historically coincide for many previously socialist countries) correlate. Croatia is used as an example of a typical transition country possessive of a specific type of market socialism, with controversial outcomes arising from its particular transition process in comparison to its peers. Despite the assistance of the European Union, which helped many new members from socialist backgrounds to recover their economies by upgrading their technological capabilities, this research reveals that technology transfer in less technologically developed countries is unfolding very slowly. Technological transfer occurs as a highly contextual phenomenon, dependant not only on the structure of the economy and technological and research capacities, but also on the political economy and the type of capitalism. This research identifies the three phases of the evolution of university technology transfer: science based models in socialism; endeavours towards an innovation based model throughout the transition period; and the bureaucratic model, driven by the EU cohesion policy and facilitated through access to the European Structural Funds. This research points out that bureaucratic-driven types of technology transfer should be coupled with nationally concerned actions on overall economic and political reforms in order to gain efficient results from their technology transfer efforts. © 2019, The Author(s).","Croatia; Entrepreneurship; Policy; Technology transfer","Economics; Public policy; Croatia; Entrepreneurship; Technological capability; Technological competence; Technological transfer; Technology transfer policy; Transition countries; University technology transfer; Technology transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064712234

The World Bank in 2013 estimated that only air pollution (AP) was responsible for a $225bn cost in lost productivity. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the current scholarly debate on the value of Big Data for effective healthcare management. Its focus on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in developing countries, a major cause of disability and premature death and a subject of increasing research in recent years, makes this research particularly valuable. Design/methodology/approach: In order to assess the effects of AP on CVD in developing countries, the city of Bangalore was selected as a case study. Bangalore is one of the fastest growing economies in India, representative of the rapidly growing cities in the developing world. Demographic, AP and CVD data sets covering more than 1m historic records were obtained from governmental organisations. The spatial analysis of such data sets allowed visualisation of the correlation between the demographics of the city, the levels of pollution and deaths caused by CVDs, thus informing decision making in several sectors and at different levels. Findings: Although there is increasing concern in councils and other responsible governmental agencies, resources required to monitor and address the challenges of pollution are limited due to the high costs involved. This research shows that with developments in the domains of Big Data, Internet of Things and smart cities, opportunities to monitor pollution result in high volumes of data. Existing technologies for data analytics can empower decision makers and even the public with knowledge on pollution. This paper has demonstrated a methodological approach for the collection and visual representation of Big Data sets allowing for an understanding of the spread of CVDs across the city of Bangalore, enabling different stakeholders to query the data sets and reveal specific statistics of key hotspots where action is required. Originality/value: This research has been conducted to demonstrate the value of Big Data in generating a strategic knowledge-driven decision-support system to provide focused and targeted interventions for environmental health management. This case study research is based on the use of a geographic information system for the visualisation of a Big Data set collected from Bangalore, a region in India seriously affected by pollution. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Decision making; Healthcare management; Knowledge management; Smart city",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057601075

Behavioral financial theory draws on social psychology to explain some of the irrational behaviors associated with financial decisions to help explain some of the fluctuations. In this study we argue that social media users who demonstrate an interest in finance can offer insights into ways in which irrational behaviors may affect a stock market. To test this, we analyzed all the data collected over a 3-month period in 2011 from Tencent Weibo (one of the largest microblogging websites in China). We designed a social influence (SI)-based Tencent finance-related moods model to simulate investors' irrational behaviors, and designed a Tencent Moods-based Stock Trend Analysis (TM_STA) model to detect correlations between Tencent moods and the Hushen-300 index (one of the most important financial indexes in China). Experimental results show that the proposed method can help explain the data fluctuation. The findings support the existing behavioral financial theory, and can help to understand short-term rises and falls in a stock market. We use behavioral financial theory to further explain our findings, and to propose a trading model to verify the proposed model. © 2019 ASIS&T",,"Commerce; Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Social networking (online); Financial decisions; Market trends; Microblogging; Social influence; Social media; Social psychology; Trading models; Trend analysis; Investments; article; China; finance; human; market; mood; social media; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073650242

First, we seek evidence of trust in e-voting in the responses of the public to the announcement of election results. Then we derive the following four mechanisms of trust creation or loss: the association of e-voting with the production of positive democratic effects; the making of e-voting part of the mission and identity of electoral authorities; the cultivation of a positive public attitude to IT with policies for IT-driven socio-economic development; and, in countries with turbulent political cultures, a clear distinction between the experience of voting as orderly and experiences of malpractice in other election tasks. We suggest that these mechanisms explain the different experience with e-voting of different countries. Attention to them helps in assessing the potential of electoral technologies in countries that are currently adopting them, especially fragile democracies embarking upon e-voting. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2019.","critical realism; E-voting; explanatory mechanisms; India; retroduction; trust","Economics; Critical realisms; India; Indian elections; Public attitudes; retroduction; Socio-economic development; Socio-economics; trust; Electronic voting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061099789

Although a significant body of research has examined the implications of organizational networks on knowledge diffusion, researchers know little about the impacts that diverse network interlocks have on corporate innovation outputs. To address this gap in the literature, this article draws upon insights from organizational learning and social network theory and argues that interlocked networks affect corporate innovation. Further, interlocks differ in terms of both the heterogeneity of tied-to firms—ties created through shared board directors—and the directors who create these ties. Accordingly, this study proposes that more diverse interlocks will have a greater impact on corporate technological exploration. To test this proposal, data from multiple sources were analyzed, including historical records of board appointments and data on technological innovations from U.S. public companies. Empirical results from generalized estimating equations suggest that the industrial diversity of interlocked firms increases the likelihood of technological exploration. Moreover, interlocks with R&D-intensive firms are more important for technological exploration than those created by firms that do not invest heavily in R&D. There is no empirical evidence demonstrating that the ratio of interlocks created by directors with output-oriented experience enhances technological exploration. Overall, this research reveals that diversity of leader-created board interlocks can be an important mechanism for fostering corporate entrepreneurial activities such as technological exploration. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Corporate innovation; Entrepreneurial activity; Generalized estimating equations; Historical records; Knowledge diffusion; Organizational learning; Organizational network; Technological innovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062483656

Identifying the aerosol variations and the underling determinates can provide insights into united mitigation policy controls targeting on both aerosol pollution and climate change. Long-term trend analysis and modeling offers an effective way to fully appreciate how aerosols interlink with carbon cycle and climate change. This study analyzes the current trends, models the future predictions, and investigates potential driving forces of aerosol loading at six sites across North America and East Asia during 2003–2015. Satellite-retrieved MODIS Collection 6 retrievals and ground measurements derived from AERONET are used. Results show that there is a persistent decreasing trend in AOD for both MODIS data and AERONET data at three sites. Monthly and seasonal AOD variations reveal consistent aerosol patterns at sites along mid-latitudes. Regional differences caused by impacts of climatology and land cover types are observed for the selected sites. Statistical validation of time series ARIMA models indicates that the non-seasonal ARIMA model performs better for AERONET AOD data than for MODIS AOD data at most sites, suggesting the method works better for data with higher quality. The seasonal ARIMA model reproduces time series with distinct seasonal variations much more precisely. The reasonably predicted AOD values could provide reliable estimates to better inform the decision-making for sustainable environmental management. Drawn from aerosol pollution control strategies, it is suggested that the enforcement of regulations on emission sources and the initiative of reforestation on emission sinks could have potential implications for climate change mitigation. © 2019","Aerosol optical depth; ARIMA; Climate change mitigation; MODIS C6; Time series","Aerosols; Air pollution; Decision making; Environmental management; Pollution control; Radiometers; Reforestation; Sustainable development; Time series; Aerosol optical depths; ARIMA; Climate change mitigation; Enforcement of regulations; MODIS C6; Seasonal ARIMA models; Statistical validation; Sustainable environmental management; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063275242

One reason for this might be the neglect of the psychological make-up of cities and its citizens. To assess the value added of incorporating psychological factors alongside the more standard explanations, this paper tests the relevance of personality traits for economic growth for a sample of UK cities. We argue that Neuroticism and Conscientiousness, and the traits that make up entrepreneurship culture help to explain urban growth differences. The personality scores of >400,000 UK residents are combined with economic data for 63 UK cities from 1981 to 2011. We find that both Neuroticism and entrepreneurship culture matter for economic growth. Our main contribution is that geographically clustered personality traits help to understand economic growth differences, and add explanatory power over and above standard determinants, also when the recursive relationship between personality traits and economic growth is taken into account. © 2018 The Author(s) (2018).

This process may be conceived of as ""cascaded,"" in that a combination of upstream choices (e.g., of privacy settings on a social network site) and downstream choices (e.g., of what to reveal on the site) together determine ultimate privacy outcomes. In a series of experiments, we examine the potential impact of choice architecture in cascaded privacy choice settings. We investigate how changes in choice frames implemented by service providers can influence consumers' upstream disclosure settings, often in ways that they are unaware of and that may be destructive to them. Whether the effects of choice frames upstream are ultimately detrimental to individuals' privacy, however, depends on whether they are offset by more or less protective downstream choices. Thus, we also examine whether such upstream effects of choice architecture are ""mitigated"" through changes in downstream self-disclosure. We find, first, that various manipulations of decision frames, common in privacy contexts, significantly impact participants' upstream choice of disclosure settings. Second, we do not find evidence that the impact of choice architecture upstream is mitigated downstream: participants' self-disclosure rates do not adjust or change in response to choice architecture-induced changes in upstream choices. These findings call into question both policy makers' and industry advocates' reliance on choice-based privacy protection mechanisms, contribute to an emerging behavioral perspective on privacy decision making, and highlight the importance of accounting for the cascaded nature of privacy decision making in both policy and managerial settings. © 2017 INFORMS.","Behavior and behavioral decision making; Choice architecture; Framing; Privacy decision making","Network architecture; Behavioral decision makings; Complex Processes; Framing; Potential impacts; Privacy protection; Privacy Settings; Service provider; Social Network Sites; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067193113

Prior literature suggests opposite predictions on the direction in which competition drives IT investment. This paper analyzes a game theoretic model of duopoly competition and shows that an important feature of IT sheds new light on firms' investment decisions: IT implementation can fail. Without the possibility of implementation failure, the opportunity to invest in IT hurts firms' profits because the productivity gains are competed away. Implementation failure creates a possibility of cost-based differentiation and mitigates competition, although these two effects can drive firms' IT investment in opposite directions. Interestingly, a higher probability of implementation failure can lead to lower investment risks and higher expected profits. Firms in highly competitive markets are better able to recoup the returns to their IT investments and, therefore, more motivated to invest in risky IT than firms in less competitive markets.

With regard to supporting the early growth of spin-offs, literature has consistently emphasized the role of spatial and social proximity to universities in providing access to resources and facilitating technology transfer. However, little is known about the relationship between universities and their spin-offs, especially after incubation programs have been completed. Using a sample of 100 spin-offs from two universities in Europe, we develop several hypotheses predicting the motivation to maintain proximity to universities and the impact on performance. The findings suggest that factors such as research orientation, entrepreneurial orientation and market hostility encourage spin-offs to maintain proximity to universities. However, spin-offs experience diminishing returns in performance as commercial activities are reduced due to them over-pursuing proximity. More specifically, spin-offs with a high entrepreneurial orientation perform strongly if they are able to balance their level of proximity to universities. Our study contributes to the current discussion on the role of the university in supporting entrepreneurial activities and sparks a new debate on how to support the long-term growth of spin-offs, including differentiation in support according to entrepreneurial orientation, as well as flexibility in support. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Incubator; Performance; Proximity; Spin-offs; University","Technology transfer; Incubator; Performance; Proximity; Spin off; University; Economic and social effects; entrepreneur; performance assessment; technology transfer; university sector; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056169123

The goal is to find an order quantity that minimizes the worst-case expected cost among an ambiguity set of distributions. The ambiguity set consists of those distributions that are not far—in the sense of the total variation distance—from a nominal distribution. The maximum distance allowed in the ambiguity set (called level of robustness) places the DRO between the risk-neutral stochastic programming and robust optimization models. An important problem a decision maker faces is how to determine the level of robustness—or, equivalently, how to find an appropriate level of risk-aversion. We answer this question in two ways. Our first approach relates the level of robustness and risk to the regions of demand that are critical (in a precise sense we introduce) to the optimal cost. Our second approach establishes new quantitative relationships between the DRO model and the corresponding risk-neutral and classical robust optimization models. To achieve these goals, we first focus on a single-product setting and derive explicit formulas and properties of the optimal solution as a function of the level of robustness. Then, we demonstrate the practical and managerial relevance of our results by applying our findings to a healthcare problem to reserve operating room time for cardiovascular surgeries.

The accuracy of the models on test data surprisingly showed ANN to have only a slightly better accuracy than LR and MDA. The ANN's number of units in the hidden layer and weight decay hyperparameters were consequently tuned using the grid search. Tuning process led to tedious machine computation that was aborted after many hours without completion. The state of art big data analytics (BDA) technology was, for the first time in failure prediction, consequently employed and the tuning was completed in some seconds. Mean accuracy from cross validation was used for selection of the model with best parameter values, which were used to develop a new ANN model that outperformed all previously developed models on test data. Subsequent use of selected variables to develop new models led to reduced tuning computational cost, but not improved performance. Since the real-life effect of a misclassification cost is greater than the tedious computation cost, it was concluded that BDA is the best compromise. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial neural networks; big data applications; construction industry; machine learning; predictive models; support vector machines","Construction industry; Discriminant analysis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Big data applications; Computational costs; Failure prediction models; Logistic regressions; Machine computations; Misclassification costs; Multiple discriminant analysis; Predictive models; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051761533

As a result, these models provide a suitable framework to incorporate the different cumulative processes determining the evolution and strategic behavior of firms in the economics and business literatures. In the current paper, we incorporate two distinct complementary types of sequentially cumulative processes within a dynamic slacks-based measure DEA model. In particular, human capital and knowledge, constituting fundamental intangible inputs, exhibit a cumulative effect that goes beyond the corresponding factor endowment per period. At the same time, carry-over activities between consecutive periods will be used to define the pervasive effect that technology and infrastructures have on the productive capacity and efficiency of DMUs. The resulting dynamic DEA model accounts for the evolution of the knowledge accumulation and technological development processes of DMUs when evaluating both their overall and per period efficiency.

First, the structural effect accounts for the largest proportion of the total contribution in consumption, reflecting the significance of the growth of solar energy.

Existing research mainly focused on the economic impact of transportation factors, the environmental impact is not fully involved. To identify the coupling effect of transportation factors, this study explored the spillover effects of multiple factors on CO2 emission using the panel data of 30 administrative regions in China. A hybrid model combining expanded Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) and Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) was used to estimate spillover effects of population, economic, technological and transportation factors on CO2 emissions. And CO2 emission was calculated by the carbon emission from fossil fuel consumption (coal, oil and gas) and cement production according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) accounting method. The estimation results indicate the spatial and time-lagged effects were both obvious for CO2 emission. In addition, transportation factors including the railway factor and the road factor were both found to have significant positive effects on CO2 emission, 0.344% and 0.129% influence respectively.

To support this aim, managers must use incentive and goal programs in ethical ways. This study examines experimentally the potential ethical costs associated with incentive-driven and goal-induced employee behavior from a managerial perspective. In a quasi-experimental setting, 243 MBA students with significant professional work experience evaluated a hypothetical employee’s ethical behavior under incentive pay systems modeled on a business case. In the role of the employee’s manager, participants evaluated the ethicality of the employee’s incentive-driven and goal-induced ethical/unethical behavior and the outcomes of behavior, with consequences that were either favorable or unfavorable to the organization. The results indicated that participants discounted the ethical considerations of incentive-driven and goal-induced behavior when consequences were favorable to the organization. Participants’ morals and outcome orientations were also significantly related to their ethical judgments and intentions to intervene.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of transparency about supply chain sustainability on consumers as critical stakeholders and investigate the effectiveness of message characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilizes two scenario-based experiments grounded in a refurbished goods context: Study 1, which employs a 2×2 between-subject experiment investigates the effects of product type and sustainable information provision on consumers evaluations, and Study 2, which employs a 2×1 between-subject experiment examines the effects of sustainable information direction on consumer evaluations. A total of 348 participants were recruited from the Amazon M-Turk platform across the two experiments. Data are analyzed with regression analysis using the PROCESS macro in SPSS and the Johnson–Neyman technique. Findings: Contrary to prior research that assumes that refurbished products are associated with lower quality, quality perceptions are moderated by individuals’ environmental involvement (EI) and the information presented by the firm. More importantly, consumer evaluations are influenced by specific characteristics of sustainable supply chain messages: high EI individuals have higher willingness-to-pay a premium (WTPP) when the message is consistent with original beliefs (pro-attitudinal). In contrast to prior theory, there was no difference in the WTPP of consumers with high EI and low EI for counter-attitudinal messages. Practical implications: The study shows that what to say, how to say it and to whom, are critical for firms who seek to nudge consumers to support their sustainable practices. Originality/value: The value of communicating information on sustainability has been well established. However, little is known about such association when the information provided trades off environmental benefits and product quality. This research addresses the gap in a refurbished product context. The research studies the effect of sustainable supply chain transparency and message characteristics on stakeholders’ evaluations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Mixed method; North America; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070359164

A platform acts as a matchmaker between a firm needing funds and a crowd of investors willing to provide capital. After the firm is funded, it pays back the investors using revenue-sharing contracts, with a prespecified investment multiple (investors will receive M ≥ 1 dollars for every dollar invested) and a revenue-sharing proportion, over an investment horizon of uncertain duration. Academic/practical relevance: We analyze the revenue-sharing contract approach to crowdfunding, and we assist the firm to determine its optimal contract parameters to maximize its expected net present value (NPV) subject to investor participation constraints and platform fees. Methodology: A natural multiperiod formulation for the firm’s problem results in an intractable stochastic optimization model, which we approximate using a deterministic model. In the approximation model, we use a cash buffer for dealing with cash flow uncertainties; we are able to solve the approximation model analytically. Results: Parametrized on real data from Bolstr campaigns, our approximation solutions give an NPV in the stochastic problem that is within 0.2% of the simulation-based optimal NPV for all levels of cash flow uncertainty. We compare revenue-sharing contracts with equity crowdfunding and observe that the former result in higher NPVs and comparable bankruptcy probabilities. We also compare revenue-sharing contracts with fixed rate loans and find that, for most cases considered, revenue-sharing contracts provide a higher NPV and a lower probability of bankruptcy than a fixed rate loan. We also show that these benefits are more significant for firms with higher levels of cash flow uncertainty. Managerial implications: Revenue-sharing contracts are a novel approach to crowdfunding, and we show that are superior to other financing models. © 2019 INFORMS.","Analytics; Crowdfunding; Optimization; Revenue-sharing contracts; Simulation","Crowdsourcing; Economics; Optimization; Analytics; Approximation solution; Bankruptcy probability; Crowdfunding; Managerial implications; Revenue sharing contracts; Simulation; Stochastic optimization model; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071781762

We frame CEO selection as risk-taking, in which outsiders are relatively risky hires, with a greater tendency to generate extreme performance outcomes—either positive or negative—as compared to insiders. We base this expectation on two complementary theoretical perspectives: human capital and information asymmetry. We conduct multiple tests on large samples of CEO successions, with controls for endogeneity, and find that outsiders are indeed associated with more extreme performance outcomes than are insiders. Managerial Summary: We shed new light on the performance implications associated with outsider CEOs. Instead of asking the customary question, “Do outsider CEOs, on average, perform better or worse than insider CEOs?,” we frame CEO selection as risk-taking.

The current paper aims to close this gap by examining manufacturers’ strategic partnerships with retailers, with a special emphasis on information sharing, integration, and collaborative forecasting of time-sensitive products in food supply chains. Through Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis of survey data collected from 105 food manufacturers in Europe and North America, this research reveals the importance of strategic partnerships for satisfaction from forecasts generated for perishable, seasonal, promotional and newly-launched products in the food industry. Group forecasting and manufacturers’ external integration with retailers are found to be significant for strategic partnerships. In addition, our findings show that manufacturers’ internal integration is positively associated with group forecasting, external integration and judgmental adjustments. Our findings also reveal that information sharing with retailers facilitates consensus forecasts in group forecasting. These results provide unique insights to researchers and practitioners of human judgment in supply chain forecasting towards enhancing strategic partnerships in food supply chains. © 2018","Food supply chain; Forecast satisfaction; Judgmental adjustments; Strategic partnerships; Supply integration","article; catering service; consensus; controlled study; decision making; Europe; food chain; food industry; forecasting; human; least square analysis; North America; physician; satisfaction; scientist",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056727965

When overall coworkers' ability is high, however, further increasing their ability may trigger waiters to reduce sales efforts. Our empirical findings imply that, to maximize sales, managers should mix waiters with heterogeneous ability levels during the same shift.

Recommendation accuracy and diversity are important criteria to evaluate recommender system performance. Many different strategies have been developed in existing literature to balance the trade-offs between accuracy and diversity. However, those methods often focus on a one-size-fit-all trade-off strategy without considering each individual user’ specific recommendation situation, which leads to improvements only in individual diversity or aggregate diversity. In addition, the trust relationships among users have not been studied to improve the trade-off strategy aforementioned. In this paper, we propose an adaptive trust-aware recommendation model based on a new trust measurement developed using a user-item bipartite network. We show via experiments on three different datasets that our model can not only balance and adapt accuracy with both individual and aggregate diversities, but also achieve significant improvements on accuracy for cold-start users and long-tailed items. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bipartite network; Long-tailed products; Recommendation diversity; Recommender systems; Trust relationships","Aggregates; Economic and social effects; Online systems; Bipartite network; Individual diversities; Long-tailed products; Online business; Recommendation accuracy; Recommendation diversities; Trust measurement; Trust relationship; Recommender systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068083625

This wrong perception of BIM and low interest in 3D asset management (AM) is one of the major reasons for the slow adoption by clients in the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. The purpose of this paper is to identify the techniques and strategies of streamlining AM systems for BIM-based integration, and how the information is captured from physical assets towards BIM-based integration for clients to derive value from BIM investments. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study strategy was used to study the strategic implementation process of integrating BIM with AM systems and the business value of BIM in AM by a large asset owner in the UK. Findings: The paper identifies key strategies in the adoption of BIM-based processes by an asset owner, the implementation process, the challenges and the benefits attained. Several barriers were identified as the challenges of adopting BIM-based processes in AM: complexity and cost associated with BIM; irrelevance of 3D geometric data in AM processes; nature of asset ownership structure; managing the asset handover process; managing change within the organisation. Organisations will have to consider the following issues in streaming asset information with BIM: the development for a clear strategy prior to adoption; connecting the strategy to the business goals; and conducting the discovery exercise to identify organisational information needs. Originality/value: The research addresses a significant gap in the development of techniques and strategies for asset owners to streamline BIM with AM systems and derive business value from such integration. The research context is a case study involving a large owner-operator in the UK that has been able to derive value from BIM systems in their AM processes. The key value of the paper is improving asset owners’ understanding of BIM in AM by demonstrating the implementation strategies, linkage to organisational objectives, challenges, value management process and business value of BIM in AM. Another contribution of the paper is improving the understanding of BIM, which is usually viewed as 3D models and that 3D geometric data do not have much value for AM tasks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AM; Asset owners; Assets; BIM; Building information modelling; Integration; Management; Process; Value","3D modeling; Americium; Asset management; Information management; Information theory; Integration; Management; Planning; Processing; Architectural , engineering and constructions; Asset owners; Assets; Building Information Modelling; Design/methodology/approach; Implementation strategies; Organisational objectives; Value; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063338187

Under a two-echelon setting, shipments from geographically dispersed sources that are en route to the customer are first transported to intermediary facilities for possible consolidation into full-container loads. Each shipment has a preset pickup date at the source and a delivery time window at the destination. Further, each shipment can be partitioned into multiple shipments that can be routed to different intermediary facilities. Shipments reaching the intermediary facilities are consolidated and forwarded to the final destination in the second echelon. A mixed integer programming model is developed for this problem, which employs piecewise cost functions to capture the economies of scales that are common in transportation. To speed up obtaining solutions, an exact solution methodology is proposed. The proposed solution method lends itself to container load relaxation, temporal decomposition, and valid cut generation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via a real-life problem faced by a large 3PL provider. A computation study is carried out to investigate the proposed method's sensitivity to key factors such as the demand structure, delivery time windows, number of gateways and the consolidation cost breakpoints. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","3PL; Delivery time window; Freight consolidation; Temporal decomposition; Transportation","Containers; Cost functions; Costs; Economics; Integer programming; Outsourcing; Ships; Transportation; Delivery time windows; Economies of scale; Freight consolidations; Mixed integer programming model; Real-life problems; Temporal decomposition; Third-party logistics (3PL) providers; Transportation cost; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059806625

This paper explores whether and why retailers can use either of these pricing modalities as an effective defense against a competitor entering the market with the alternative pricing modality. Various studies have shown that consumers are strategic and heterogeneous in their valuation of a product. Consumers are also shown to be regret-prone, and anticipation of regret affects their purchase decisions. Consumers experience availability regret when they are unable to purchase products due to stockouts and high-price regret when they miss an opportunity to purchase products at low prices. Considering such factors, consumers decide whether, when, and from which retailer to purchase the product. In such a market environment, we find that the possible entry of a competitor should deter retailers from using the EDLP pricing modality but not markdown. We also identify a new reason for the markdown retailer to ration stock (in addition to the reason for discouraging consumers to wait for the markdown). In particular, we show that the markdown retailer can use inventory rationing to preclude a cutthroat competition and bankruptcy after the entry of an EDLP retailer. We also quantify how consumer regret affects both retailers' decisions and resulting profits. In particular, in a competitive market, the EDLP retailer cannot simply disregard consumers' availability and high-price regret (even when it stocks ample inventory and does not discount prices). We show that high-price regret and availability regret have complementary effects on the markdown retailer's rationing strategy and the EDLP retailer's price decision. Finally, using a proprietary price data set from a large department store, we show that ignoring regret factors causes the markdown retailer to leave up to 20% of its profits on the table. In addition, in a competitive market, the markdown retailer rations too aggressively when regret is ignored and, as a result, leaves some of the forgone profit to its competitor-the EDLP retailer. The retail industry is often characterized by its slim profit margins. In such an environment, the aforementioned results also suggest that retailers should seriously consider investing in developing the capacity to estimate and quantify the role of regret in consumers' purchase decisions. © 2017 INFORMS.","Competition; Everyday low price; Markdown; Pricing; Regret","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Profitability; Competitive markets; Everyday low price; Inventory rationing; Markdown; Market environment; Purchase decision; Regret; Retail industry; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067208020

In particular, state expansion of Medicaid programs held the promise of reducing hospitals' uncompensated care costs as a result of expanding health insurance to many previously uninsured individuals. Recent research indicates that in the early phases of Medicaid expansion, many hospitals did experience a substantial decline in uncompensated care costs. However, studies to date have not considered whether Medicaid expansion resulted in payment shortfalls that offset some of what hospitals saved from lower uncompensated care costs. We examined filings submitted by hospitals to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)-one of the few publicly available sources of national data on both uncompensated care costs and Medicaid payment shortfalls. We also compared changes in uncompensated care costs and Medicaid payment shortfalls for hospitals in expansion states with those in nonexpansion states. Our findings indicate that state expansion of Medicaid led to substantial reductions in hospitals' uncompensated care costs, but the savings were offset somewhat by increased Medicaid payment shortfalls. Therefore, studies that focus only on reductions in uncompensated care costs can overstate the benefits of Medicaid expansion on hospitals finances. © 2019 Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives.",,"article; community care; finance; human; medicaid; economics; health care policy; health economics; health insurance; hospital cost; medicaid; United States; Economics, Hospital; Hospital Costs; Humans; Insurance, Health; Medicaid; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Uncompensated Care; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062600029

Design/methodology/approach: A conventional statistical model (logistic regression) and two machine learning-based (i.e. artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines) data mining models were employed by also using five-fold cross-validation in the classification phase. In order to overcome the data imbalance problem, random undersampling technique was utilized. After constructing the patient-specific risk score, k-means clustering algorithm was employed to group these patients into risk groups. Findings: Results showed that the ANN model achieved the best results with an area under the curve score of 0.867, while the sensitivity and specificity were 0.715 and 0.892, respectively. Also, the construction of patient-specific risk scores offer useful insights to the medical experts, by helping them find a trade-off between risks, costs and resources.

System availability is a common, contractually agreed upon performance metric that measures customer expectations. In this paper, we analyse performance contracts from the perspective of the supplier, where system availability serves as the performance metric. We develop single-period and multi-period supplier performance models and demonstrate how these models are used to maximise a supplier's profit in the context of a PBC. We provide empirical evidence from a mining and construction equipment industry and demonstrate how PBC overcomes the information asymmetry and moral hazard that is common in SDS principal agent models. Practically, our models can be used to increase the likelihood of success for both the supplier and the customer when they embrace PBC. Our main contributions include establishing the optimal availability that an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can provide by considering their own probability of loss; analysing the properties of an OEM's future net profit function using first order autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process; and performing marginal analysis and providing bounds for the net profit function for linear and non-linear revenue functions.

Such campaigns often take the form of charity-linked promotions, whereby a firm donates a specific amount to a charitable cause when a customer takes up the promotion through a related purchase. We carried out three field experiments to study such promotions in the context of an online taxi-booking platform. Customers were randomly assigned to different treatment groups, which received either a charitylinked or a discount-based promotion from a range of monetary amounts. Take-up rates for charity-linked promotions were not only much smaller than for discount-based promotions but also less sensitive to the exact amount involved, consistent with a view that the decision to take up a charity-linked promotion was driven in part by a 'warm glow' from mere association with giving. We also find a selection effect in promotion take-up: charity-linked promotions were disproportionately taken up by people who had already been more active customers. Although a promotion take-up does seem to represent new demand rather than mere substitution of a booking that would have occurred anyway, longitudinal data analysis reveals little evidence of a lasting treatment effect on long-term demand beyond the promotion period for either kind of promotion. Given the high cost relative to benefit for the promotional bookings themselves, this finding raises concerns regarding the prevalent practice of firms devoting significant funds for short-term promotions without rigorously examining their exact impact. © 2018 INFORMS.","Corporate philanthropy; Corporate social responsibility; Customer behavior; Field experiments; Online marketplaces","Electronic commerce; Taxicabs; Corporate philanthropies; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Customer behavior; Field experiment; On-line marketplaces; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053575631

However, it is not clear whether and how firms can actively influence customers' mobile app adoptions and increase their purchases through these induced adoptions. Using a randomized field experiment involving over 230,000 customers, we investigate the differential impacts of offering incentives or information on customers' mobile app adoptions and subsequent purchase behaviors. We find that (1) providing monetary incentives and providing information can both lead to a significant increase in mobile app adoptions and that (2) the causal effect of induced mobile app adoptions varies greatly depending on how customers are motivated. Although providing monetary incentives leads to a larger increase in mobile app adoptions, such incentive-induced adoptions do not result in more purchases in the long run. In contrast, providing information leads to effective mobile adoptions that sustainably increase customers' purchases and overall profits for the firm. In further examining customers' multichannel purchase behaviors, we find that there is a complementary effect between the mobile app and the desktop channel for information-induced app adopters but a substitution effect between the mobile app and the mobile web channel for incentiveinduced app adopters. For information-induced app adopters, the mobile app serves as a discovery tool and helps them find a greater variety of deals. Finally, in exploring the underlying drivers of such differences in the effect of induced adoptions, we find that information compared with incentives serves as a better sorting device and can attract customers who have a greater need for the app and use itmore effectively. Our findings provide actionable insights to firms on designing interventions to motivate effective mobile adoptions. © 2019 INFORMS.","Field experiment; Induced adoption; Local average treatment effect; Mobile app; Multichannel; Online-to-offline","Information systems; Field experiment; Induced adoption; Local average; Mobile app; Multichannel; Offline; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068611365

In this article, we study the process through which social enterprises facilitate local communities in effecting the process of institutional change as they introduce social innovations. Analyzing rich ethnographic data from 19 social enterprises, we develop the process of “facilitated institutional work” for implementing social innovation. We present a process model for implementing social innovation with four distinct stages involving social enterprises—(1) legitimating themselves within local communities, (2) disrupting aspects of the local institutional environment, (3) helping re-envision institutional norms or practices, and (4) resourcing the institutional change process. The four stages relate to important concerns that local communities have in working with social enterprises implementing social innovations. These community-level concerns revolve around the following questions: (1) Why should we allow an external social enterprise to be involved in our affairs? (2) Why do we need to change?

Specifically considering game attendance as an important form of market demand, the authors employ regression modeling to analyze the relationship between game attendance and protests organized to struggle against racial injustices by football players at four Division I Football Bowl Subdivision programs. The results from the empirical models suggest that the voting demographics of the local market a team plays in have a significant relationship with attendance after a protest, with some schools experiencing declines in consumer interest.

The control is based on multi-period forecasts of the mean and covariance of financial returns from a multivariate hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters. There are computational advantages to using model predictive control when estimates of future returns are updated every time new observations become available, because the optimal control actions are reconsidered anyway. Transaction and holding costs are discussed as a means to address estimation error and regularize the optimization problem. The proposed approach to multi-period portfolio selection is tested out of sample over two decades based on available market indices chosen to mimic the major liquid asset classes typically considered by institutional investors. By adjusting the risk aversion based on realized drawdown, it successfully controls drawdowns with little or no sacrifice of mean–variance efficiency. Using leverage it is possible to further increase the return without increasing the maximum drawdown. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic asset allocation; Forecasting; Maximum drawdown; Model predictive control; Regime switching; Risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048775051

The results show that servitization measures are inconsistent across studies, even among those investigating similar research questions, and that a theoretical reference for their appropriate use is still missing. Focusing on these shortcomings, this study conceptualizes the firm-level servitization degree in three classes, i.e. ‘extension’, ‘infusion’, and ‘orientation’. Hence, measures to operationalize each class are derived from the literature review and subsequently discussed with a panel of experts. In addition, servitization measurement is further conceptualized other than firm-level degree, as a measurement at the regional, product, and individual employee levels, other than at the firm level. This study is the first to provide a systematic review on the topic and to develop a general conceptualization and operationalization of servitization measurement. Furthermore, this research is the first to employ an international standard classification of economic activities as a basis to identify objectively firms’ service offerings.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a variety of time series procedures, including the bounds test, Granger causality test, impulse response functions and generalized variance decomposition to analyze the relationship between monthly tourist arrivals (TA) to the USA, real gross domestic product (GDP) and real effective exchange rates. Findings: Results suggest that GDP Granger causes TA in the USA in the long run, indicating the economy-driven tourism growth hypothesis. Additionally, a shock to GDP generates a positive and significant effect on TA that persists in the long-run, while exchange rate shocks only have a significant effect in the first six months. Research limitations/implications: Different tourism sectors may exert different degrees of influence on the economy. The use of aggregate data on TA in the analysis assumes homogeneity in the industry, thus, only represents the average relationship between tourism and GDP. Practical implications: This study provides insight that shapes the investment, marketing, sustainability decisions of the public and private sectors aim at increasing tourist flows to drive economic development at the national, state and local levels. Originality/value: Though several studies have examined the factors influencing the international tourist demand of the USA, this is the first to investigate the causal relationships between tourism, GDP and exchange rates for the USA.

The main objective of this study is to propose a neuro-fuzzy modelling entitled ensemble-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) learning to predict and analyse the interrelationship between renewable energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions of G8+5 countries. This will help the governments and industry sectors to formulate energy policies and develop energy resources sustainably. The prediction method was constructed by extracting the fuzzy rules from the real-world dataset of World Development Indicators (WDI) and generalising the relationships of the inputs and output parameters for accurate prediction of CO2 emissions. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and the results show its efficiency in the prediction of CO2 emissions by incorporating the import indicators, including renewable energy consumption and economic growth. The U test of Sasabuchi–Lind–Mehlum (SLM) was conducted to identify the interrelationship results obtained from the ensemble ANFIS learning and the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The results of SLM test found an inverse U-shape condition among all countries except Brazil. The prediction of CO2 emissions trends using the soft computing approach (ensemble ANFIS) indicated that the consumption of renewable energy reduces CO2 emissions. The proposed soft computing method was found efficient in predicting CO2 emissions. It was in line with the foreseen targets of increasing the renewable energy generation and achieving the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) objectives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Ensemble adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Fuzzy rules; G8 + 5 countries; Renewable energy consumption","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Global warming; Inverse problems; Renewable energy resources; Soft computing; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; CO2 emissions; Economic growths; G8 + 5 countries; Renewable energy consumption; Fuzzy inference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066448962

Group firms may support each other when in financial distress. Potential group support represents an off-balance sheet asset for the receiving firm and an off-balance sheet liability for the firm offering support. We find that subsidiary information improves parent default prediction over and above group-level consolidated information possibly because intragroup exposures are netted out upon consolidation.Moreover, we document that improvements in parent default prediction decrease in the extent of parent-country financial reporting transparency, a finding that suggests that within-group information matters most when consolidated financial statements are expected to be of lower quality. We also show that parent and other group-firms' default risk exhibits predictive power for subsidiary default. Lastly, we find that within-group information explains cross-sectional variation in CDS spreads.

However, they still suffer from numerous economic, political and social problems, culminating in poor livelihoods, which was a key focus of the recent ‘Arab Spring’. This paper aims to contribute to the continuing debate on the factors that boost economic growth in the ACs in comparison to other regions in the world with an emphasis on the often neglected role of governance in growth. The analysis is underpinned by a neoclassical growth framework augmented with institutional controls, and panel data estimation techniques applied to a balanced panel data set over the period 1995 to 2014 for 97 countries including 19 from the Arab Region. The study found strong evidence of a significant positive impact of human capital and investment on growth but a significantly negative impact of regulatory quality. The most striking result from the baseline model is that the coefficient of governance is significant and positively determines growth in the whole sample, while it is negative in ACs sample. The outcomes of the empirical analyses clearly underline the importance of human capital and governance to improve the growth prospects of the ACs economies.

Across seven studies, we show that consumers treat type as a primary dimension and quantity as a secondary dimension, such that a change in type (versus quantity) has a greater impact on perceived healthiness or health goal impact, even when holding objective impact constant in terms of calories. We also examine whether one reason this effect occurs is because most consumers consider type (a categorical attribute) before quantity (a continuous attribute).

Findings: The results show that the most accurate model (with average prediction rate of 88.1 per cent) is the third model that is designed with two steps, one is to predict apparel ATTRIBUTEs through the apparel images, and the other is to further predict apparel MEANINGs based on predicted ATTRIBUTEs. The results indicate that adding the proposed ATTRIBUTE data that captures the deep features of clothes design does improve the model performances (e.g. from 73.5 per cent, Model B to 86 per cent, Model C), and the new concept of apparel recommendation based on style meanings is technically applicable. Originality/value: The apparel data and the design of three training models are originally introduced in this study. The proposed methodology can evaluate the pros and cons of different clothes feature extraction approaches through either images or design attributes and balance different machine learning technologies between the latest CNN and traditional SVM. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apparel recommendation system; Clothes and fashion; Deep learning; Machine learning; Smart shopping","Clothes; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Recommender systems; Support vector machines; Accurate modeling; Associated feature; Design attributes; Design/methodology/approach; Machine learning technology; Model performance; Prediction model; Smart shopping; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062939204

While the central body in such organisations faces asymmetry of information concerning the operating costs of the units, it may wish to incentivise them through benchmarking and target setting to operate as efficiently as possible. If a standard Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used for this purpose, each operating unit could estimate its own efficient targets. However, this decentralised scenario is not necessarily appropriate for a centralised organisation in which a central body wishes to optimise the performance of the system of units as a whole. On the other hand, a top-down imposed set of targets is often not suitable as they would be too demanding for some units and too lax for others. This paper proposes a DEA-based approach for incentivising the units of a hierarchically structured organisation in order to optimise the performance of the units collectively while at the same time the targets are not too demanding for inefficient units. The proposed approach is also extended so that incentive levels for operating units are determined over time, taking into account any changes in their productivity. Accordingly, the central management can strike a balance between not spending too much on incentives on the one hand and encouraging the operating units to reveal their true cost function on the other. We illustrate our approach using data from a set of German savings banks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Banking; Centralised Management; Clustering; Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA); Incentive Regulation","Cost functions; Operating costs; Banking; Centralised; Clustering; Decentralisation; Incentive regulations; Information concerning; Operating units; Target setting; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057396050

The behavior of consumers in the market where a new product is first launched may have a huge impact on the purchasing behavior of consumers in later markets through the effects of herding and word of mouth (WOM). We suggest that these effects may significantly influence advertising when new products with short life cycles, such as movies, books, games, and music, are sequentially launched and not repeatedly purchased by consumers. Using a two-period advertising signaling model, this study theoretically demonstrates that the effects of herding and WOM affect the existence of separating (signaling quality) and pooling (hiding quality information) equilibria, but the number of potential consumers in different markets has no impact. Importantly, we investigate the firm's strategic choices by comparing the profits generated under different equilibria and find that if the strength of WOM or the unit advertising cost increases, or if the herding effect decreases, a pooling equilibrium is likely to be the best, and a win-win, strategy before a new product is first released and consumed; otherwise, a separating equilibrium dominates. We also find that the cost of signaling decreases as WOM increases, whereas it increases with the herding effect or the mass of consumers in Period 1. Our findings provide several managerial implications relating to releasing product quality information for those industries in which products without repeat purchase are sequentially released in different markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Advertising; Herding effect; Product quality; Signaling game; Word of mouth","Commerce; Consumer behavior; Marketing; Purchasing; Quality control; Sales; Signaling; Herding effect; Managerial implications; Purchasing behaviors; Quality information; Repeat purchase; Signaling game; Strategic choice; Word of mouth; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056871962

It can be caused by several factors related to store operations, supply chain practices, and product characteristics. Existing methods used in the industry are inadequate to identify the causes of expiration, leading to inadequate efforts to reduce expiration. Using retail data for 768 SKUs and 10,000 stores (745,638 store-SKU-level observations), as well as upstream supply chain data from a CPG manufacturer, we show the extent to which expiration of products in retail stores is driven by case size, inventory aging in the supply chain, minimum order rules, manufacturers' incentive programs for the sales force, replenishment workload, and many control variables. A counterfactual analysis based on the model shows that our subject manufacturer can reduce expiration by up to $38.82 million per year by implementing four selected initiatives involving case size, supply chain aging, minimum order rules, and sales incentives. Further, targeted initiatives can be designed using combinations of these variables for subsets of products with the highest occurrence of expiration. © 2017 INFORMS.","Consumer packaged goods; Direct store delivery; Empirical; Food waste; Marketing/operations interface; Perishable inventory; Product expiration; Retail operations; Supply chain management; Sustainable operations management; Zero-inflated models","Manufacture; Retail stores; Supply chain management; Waste management; Consumer packaged goods; Direct store delivery; Empirical; Food waste; Marketing/operations interface; Perishable inventory; Product expiration; Retail operations; Sustainable operations; Zero-inflated models; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066077413

Additionally, the study explores the causal linkage between FDI and growth in the region. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs Pedroni’s cointegration test to examine the long-run relationship between FDI and economic growth in South America. Further, the study employs the vector error correction model (VECM) to examine the long-run relationship, and the causal nexus between FDI and economic growth in South America for the period 1980–2015. Findings: The Pedroni cointegration test establishes a long-run relationship between FDI and economic growth in a panel of ten countries in South America. The long-run estimates of the study find a significant positive impact of FDI on economic growth in the region. The VECM results find a short-run bidirectional causality between FDI and economic growth. The error-term is negative and significant. This indicates the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. Practical implications: Countries in South America should adopt policies that would substantially enlarge FDI inflows to enhance their growth and development. Originality/value: Numerous studies have examined the impact of FDI on economic growth in the context of Latin America. This study fills a gap in the existing literature by providing an empirical evidence that focuses on South America. This additional perspective could form the basis for the evaluation of the investment policies, and help policymakers to pursue FDI policies that would enhance growth and development in South America. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Foreign direct investment; South America; Vector error correction model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062998862

Moreover, SO has a similar indirect impact on firm performance via SI capability. Research limitations/implications: The survey focuses only on China; future studies should verify whether different cultural backgrounds impact the research results. Practical implications: The results suggest that firms should build up three strategic orientations (SO, CO and LO) for implementing servitization to facilitate SI capability and, thus, to improve firm performance.

Researchers have attempted various studies on consumers' reaction to product recalls but hardly any studies were conducted to find out a way to identify recalls by using users' comments specifically on social media. The earlier a company can detect a product disruption, the more a company can do in preparation to reduce its impact. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework capable of identifying a possible product recall via social networks, like Facebook or Twitter. Customers' comments found in data that express a negative sentiment are considered as non-conforming observations and plotted on a p-chart, which helps to identify when the proportion of negative comments get out of control and, as a result, a company can diminish the response time. To check its viability, we conducted three event studies of well-known companies that have experienced product recalls. The results show that customers’ negative sentiments could be monitored with the aim of predicting when a product might necessitate a recall as well as reducing decision-makers response time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Product recall; Social media; Statistical Process Control; Visual analytics","Decision making; Statistical process control; Visualization; Decision makers; Negative sentiments; Out-of-control; Product recalls; Product safety; Social media; Visual analytics; Visualization framework; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059449647

Although analytical work on the strategic responses to new entry threats (NETs) through preemptive research and development (R & D) has produced contradictory predictions, empirical analysis of this relationship is limited, largely because of the absence of a reasonable measure. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we develop and validate a measure of these threats through text mining using product descriptions provided by incumbent firm 10-K filings and business descriptions provided by startups. This novel measure of NET differs significantly from observed entry and competition. Second, we study the R & D investment strategies of IT firms facing new entry threats. Using a sample of U.S. IT firms over the period 1997-2013, we show that incumbents on average reduce R & D spending when there are greater threats from the startup space. More importantly, we show that the effect is not uniform-firms that operate in industries with strong network effects or high levels of technological cumulativeness invest relatively more in R & D when they face greater NET. Our work adds to the literature on the relationship between product market threats and firm decision making by expanding the scope of this line of work to include the role of threats of newentry-a central construct inthe field of strategy and industrial organization- and by highlighting conditions that influence the effectiveness of preemptive R & D investments as a response to NET in the IT industry. © 2019 INFORMS.","Disruptive technology; Innovation; New entry threats; R & D investment; Text mining; Uncertainty","Data mining; Decision making; Investments; Planning; Disruptive technology; Industrial organization; Investment strategy; New entry threats; Product descriptions; Research and development; Text mining; Uncertainty; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068624483

Design/methodology/approach: Zivot and Andrews (1992) unit root test with structural break is used to examine the stationarity of the variables and then the autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing procedure is used to ascertain existence of cointegration among them. Finally, order-invariant generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GFEVD) is used to establish the strength of the causal relationship between the examined variables. Findings: The results confirm that the examined variables are cointegrated. FDI, domestic investment, trade openness, human capital (HC) and institutional quality were found to have significantly positive effects on economic growth, while higher public debt and inflation rates hampered growth. GFEVD revealed unidirectional Granger causality running from FDI to economic growth in two countries; unidirectional causality from growth to FDI in two other countries; and bidirectional causality between growth and FDI in one other country. The results also indicate one-way causality from output growth to public debt in three countries and bidirectional causality between these two variables in two other countries. Practical implications: The implication is that the Caribbean Governments may need to adopt effective debt management as a major policy and intensify efforts at utilizing loans obtained judiciously for human and capital projects that have direct positive net present value but, to secure strong and inclusive growth, these strategies must be linked to policies that enhance macroeconomic stability and the quality of their institutions, encourage capital inflows and domestic investments vis-à-vis domestic savings, and increase HC and trade earnings. Originality/value: In contrast to extant studies of the public debt–FDI–output growth nexus, this study controls for the possibility of structural breaks in unit root tests along with performing bounds test for cointegration, variance decomposition analysis, Granger causality tests, and CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests for the stability of the dynamic output growth model.

In particular, we derive a linear programming method for the direct assessment of the marginal rate of transformation between a bad and a good output often used for the estimation of the unobserved price of the bad output. In contrast with the existing methods based on a conventionally specified directional distance function, the new approach does not require the assessment of two shadow prices of the good and bad outputs.

The majority of environmental impacts in a typical supply chain usually arise beyond the focal firm boundaries or even its direct suppliers. However, no method to assess the extended supply chain environmental performance that is designed to use real life data currently exists. The aim of this work is to facilitate quantitative assessment of the environmental performance of extended supply chains by introducing an innovative eco-intensity based method that relates the environmental performance of the supply chain to its economic output. The method is the first to allow assessing the environmental sustainability performance of extended supply chains based on real life data, while respecting the multiple-organisation nature and non-collaborative characteristics of the majority of real life supply chains. This is achieved through the adopted decentralised approach, materialised through a recursive mechanism to pass eco-intensity values from one tier to the next, which does not require visibility of the extended supply chain by any single member, thus enhancing the applicability of the method. The method is demonstrated through a numerical example with secondary data for four representative supply chains with different design features, to showcase its applicability. The CO2 emissions and water eco-intensities are calculated. The findings enable both benchmarking the eco-intensity performance of the extended supply chains and comparison of the eco-intensity indicators of the individual organisations, offering a basis to guide operational improvement and to support external reporting. The method has the potential to change the way organisations approach their environmental sustainability by facilitating understanding of the wider supply chain impact. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eco-intensity; Environmental benchmarking; Environmental performance; Extended supply chain; Multi-tier supply chain; Sustainability assessment","Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Numerical methods; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Eco-intensity; Environmental performance; Extended supply chains; Multi-tier; Sustainability assessment; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072707414

Hybrids, a type of organization that exist in between traditional organizational forms, are said to have rapidly gained prevalence, especially in bottom-of-the-pyramid markets. Some scholars claim that hybrids are largely responsible for the spread of established social innovations, yet hybrids do not constitute a homogenous group; instead each hybrid form exists on a spectrum between pure for-profit and not-for-profit organizational forms. It is important that empirical research investigates the role that various hybrid forms play in scaling established social innovations, especially under various bottom-of-the-pyramid market conditions. To this end, using two market-level outcome measures of scale achieved (prevalence and usage), the authors pursue two research objectives: to study (1) the extent to which, alternative hybrid forms (not-for-profit, quasi-profit, and for-profit hybrids) drive social innovation; and (2) the relative propensity of these hybrid forms to drive social innovation under varying bottom-of-the-pyramid market conditions, specifically varying levels of development and social diversity. By theorizing how different organizational forms act given their degree of hybridity, the authors develop and test six hypotheses using data sets on microfinance organizations in India. Accordingly, they find that (1) compared with not-for-profit and for-profit hybrids, quasi-profit hybrids have a propensity to become more prevalent and achieve greater usage in bottom-of-the-pyramid markets overall. Yet, within the spectrum of hybrid forms, (2) not-for-profit hybrids are more likely to become more prevalent and achieve greater usage in markets with lower development levels, whereas (3) for-profit hybrids are more likely to become more prevalent and achieve greater usage in markets with lower social diversity when compared with other hybrid forms. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association",,"Commerce; Digital storage; Finance; Profitability; Bottom of the pyramids; Developing markets; Empirical research; Market condition; Organizational forms; Outcome measures; Research objectives; Social innovations; Nonprofit organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071636532

However, R&D itself is risky and faces numerous barriers which may reduce its marginal return. Direct R&D subsides are intended to counteract such barriers, but whether they lead empirically to increased economic growth is unclear. In our structural model of the UK, subsidies offset the frictional costs associated with R&D, incentivising innovation and so stimulating productivity growth. We estimate and test this structural model by indirect inference, a method not previously used in work on R&D. We find that even temporary cuts to R&D funding have long-lasting impacts on UK economic growth. The power of the test allows us to calculate tight accuracy bounds for our results and for policy reform impacts calculated using the model.

Yet, there remains a paucity of empirical research, which explores the gap between the way innovation is promoted in the policy discourse and how it is interpreted in practice. We follow the “narrative turn” in organization studies to explore the ways in which senior executives in the UK construction sector ascribe themselves with informal roles while advocating the cause of innovation. Empirical data is derived from narrative interviews with 32 senior executives who self-identify as “innovation champions”. When talking about innovation, the respondents were found to oscillate between performative narratives of innovation and more personalized stories derived from their own experience. The narratives were invariably pre-rehearsed often to the point of being monotonous. In contrast, the personalized stories tended to be engaging and emotionally laden. The tendency for senior executives to oscillate between narratives and stories is seen as an important means through which they search for meaning while at the same time legitimizing their self-identities as “innovation champions”. Of particular note is the way in which senior managers self-ascribe themselves with informal roles which are notably at odds with those described in more formalized narratives. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Innovation; narratives; personalized stories; self-identity","Construction industry; Central component; Construction sectors; Empirical research; narratives; Organization studies; personalized stories; Policy discourse; self-identity; Managers; competitiveness; construction industry; innovation; management; performance assessment; policy approach; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061266379

In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition-ensemble forecasting paradigm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and local linear prediction (LLP). The EEMD is used to decompose energy price time series into components, including several intrinsic mode functions and one residual with a simplified structure. Motivated by the findings of the fully local characteristics of a time series decomposed by the EEMD, we adopt the LLP technique to forecast each component. The forecasting results of all the components are aggregated as a final forecast. For validation, three types of energy price time series, crude oil, electricity and natural gas prices, are studied. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves an improvement in terms of both level forecasting and direction forecasting. The performance of the proposed model is also validated through comparison with several energy price forecasting approaches from the literature. In addition, the robustness and the effects of the parameter settings of LLP are investigated. We conclude the proposed model is easy to implement and efficient for energy price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Energy price; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Local linear prediction","Costs; Natural gas; Signal processing; Time series; Energy prices; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Ensemble forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Local characteristics; Local linear predictions; Natural gas price; Forecasting; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; energy market; ensemble forecasting; prediction; price determination; time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070490691

We find the use of international certification programs is far more common than domestic programs, and that domestic programs have only been originated in advanced emerging economies. Additionally, we observe a relationship between foreign direct investment into emerging markets countries and the proliferation of green building, and that in most cases, domestic certification programs only originate after international certification activity has been introduced to the local economy.

Firms are always considering whether the investment cost on emission reduction matches the benefit. One possible practice is to look for energy savings that are able to offset additional costs from the sustainability investment.

Now is the time to consider the best strategic choices for the research, management and outreach needed to address priority issues around microplastics. It is essential to treat marine plastic pollution not only as an area in need of comprehensive research and waste management solutions, but also as a permanent pollutant in order to formulate management responses similar to those for other pollutants. First, it is essential to consider developing monitoring protocols to gather important baseline information about microplastics to inform management responses. Second, targeted research is needed to identify differences in microplastic accumulation among selected species and fisheries. Third, research is needed to explore potential threshold levels of microplastics in seafood that could trigger management actions or consumer advisories. Finally, a range of model management practices to address microplastics should be considered, such as regulating inputs from wastewater, assessing what consumer advisories are needed, and taking into account localized inputs from gear used in seafood harvesting and cultivation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consumers; Management; Microplastics; Pollutant; Seafood","consumption behavior; environmental impact; future prospect; management practice; marine policy; plastic; pollutant; pollution policy; seafood; strategic approach; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062437679

The grid operator must meet exogenous electricity demand and also buy back all electricity (produced by PV systems) at the FIT set by the regulator. Customers decide whether or not to invest in a PV system. Adoption rates affect the manufacturer and operator by (respectively) establishing the demand for PV systems and determining how much PV electricity is fed into the grid. The PV manufacturer’s decision variable is the sales price per PV unit. The decisions of all players in the model are intertwined in a way that clearly affects their respective welfare. We demonstrate in particular how technology and market characteristics—including PV manufacturing cost and market competition—change the optimal decisions of players and thereby influence the effectiveness of FITs, the number of PV adopters, and the cost to provide the social benefit of on-demand electricity.

To empirically test the proposed hypotheses, questionnaire survey data collected from Chinese energy enterprises are statistically analysed by structural equation models (SEMs). The results show that, first, energy technology innovations, the energy market, and socio-technical regimes are the major forces in the transition to sustainable energy in China. Second, the effects of the three main factors on the energy transition vary according to 11 different subfactors. Some subfactors, i.e., innovation strategy, innovation factors, innovation policy, innovation network, and new energy competitiveness, have very important positive effects on the energy transition. Some subfactors, i.e., competitiveness of the coal industry, customer habits and coal-based infrastructure, have negative effects on the transition to sustainable energy in China. Third, the influence of the subfactors on the transition performance is diminished as a result of the joint intermediate effects of transition behaviours. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Energy technology innovation; Energy transition; Influencing factors; Socio-technical regimes","Coal industry; Commerce; Energy conservation; Power markets; Surveys; China; Energy technologies; Energy transitions; Influencing factors; Socio-technical regimes; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060934526

While the emotion and brain models proved to be as good as conventional data in explaining and predicting consumer choice, the eye-tracking model generated superior predictions.

Although conceptual and empirical studies on the business ramifications of online reviews abound, little is known about how online previews moderate the effects of online reviews on sales. To cast light on this issue, the current research investigated the interactive effects of exposure to online previews and reviews on individual purchase decisions. We analyzed a unique two-month panel data set on 270,260 sessions that comprise clickstream data on consumers’ exposure to previews and reviews and data on their subsequent purchase behaviors. On the basis of analyses underlain by a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that online previews positively influence individual purchase decisions. More importantly, significant interactions exist between previews and reviews, as evidenced by the decreasing positive effect of previews with increasing review volume and average review rating. In addition, previews can complement reviews when a high variance in the latter renders purchase decisions difficult. We further examined the sequence effect of exposure to previews and reviews and discovered that exposure to previews following the experience of reviews may exert a considerable positive influence on individual purchase decisions. The results from an additional field experiment and a text-based sentiment analysis reinforced the validity of our main findings by mitigating concerns regarding the endogeneity and the accuracy of the review quality, respectively. The findings provide practical implications with regard to the design of optimal strategies for releasing preview information to digital platforms.

Network DEA, as an important branch of DEA, was built to examine the internal structure of a system, whereas traditional DEA models regard a system as a ‘black box’. However, only a few previous studies on parallel systems have considered the interdependent relationship between system components. In recent years, parallel interdependent processes systems commonly exist in production systems because of serious competition among organisations. Thus, an approach to measure the efficiency of such systems should be proposed. This paper builds an additive DEA model to measure a parallel interdependent processes system with two components which have an interdependent relationship. Then, the model is applied to analyse the ‘985 Project’ universities in China, and certain policy implications are explained. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive model; Data envelopment analysis; network DEA; parallel interdependent processes systems; ‘985 Project’ universities","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Public policy; Additive models; Decision making unit; Efficiency evaluation; Internal structure; Network DEA; Policy implications; Production system; System components; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053498603

However, recent NPD process is significantly different from the conventional NPD specifically with the inclusion of sustainability considerations under circular economy (CE) context. In theory, NPD with CE considerations (CE-NPD), compared with the conventional NPD, is associated with higher costs and longer development times. This study empirically examines the effect of the CE-NPD process on both time-to-market (TTM) and profit performance in the context of Chinese private enterprises. In addition, the role of traditional Chinese philosophies of Confucianism and Taoism in influencing the CE-NPD process–performance link is also investigated. We find that Confucianism positively moderates the relationship between the CE-NPD process and TTM performance. However, it negatively moderates the CE-NPD-profit link. On the other hand, the moderating effect of Taoism is negative on both the CE-NPD-TTM and CE-NPD-profit links. An interesting finding of this study is that the coexistence of Confucian and Taoist values in NPD workers has the strongest positive impact on the relationship between the CE-NPD process and performance. Our study provides insights on the way in which companies should plan to apply Chinese philosophies during the CE-NPD process to maximise the benefits. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","circular economy; Confucianism; manufacturing strategy; new product development; private enterprises; Taoism","Manufacture; Philosophical aspects; Profitability; Truck trailers; Circular economy; Confucianism; Manufacturing strategy; New product development; Private enterprise; Taoism; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055583525

Correspondingly, recycling trade relationships among economies are changing profoundly with the constant adjustment of economic and environmental policies. Based on complex network approach and top network analysis, this paper aims to comprehensively explore the structural features and their evolutionary patterns of global recycling trade networks from the macro, medium and micro levels by using global multi-region input-output data. The results are: At the macro level, the depth of global recycling import and export markets has strengthened continuously. The breadth of recycling exports showed a “pre-concentration, post-diversification” trend, and the import market breath demonstrated an opposite trend. At the medium level, the community structure of the global recycling export market increased rapidly in the early stage and became stable in the medium and late stages, while that of import market rapidly declined in the late stage, which means the import market was more sensitive to relevant policies and economic events. At the individual level, developed economics have been trying to transfer recycling products to developing economies, causing the former dominate global recycling export markets and the latter dominate the import markets. Recycling policies of economies, especially the developing economies have a serious impact on the global recycling trade pattern. Therefore, China's new announcement in 2018 for prohibiting import “foreign waste” will inevitably have a huge impact on the global recycling market. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Centrality degree; Community; Complex network; Global recycling trade; Top network","Complex networks; Environmental protection; Recycling; Centrality degree; Community; Community structures; Developing economies; Environment protection; Environmental policy; Environmental pressures; Structural feature; Commerce; centralization; complexity; environmental policy; input-output analysis; local participation; recycling; article; breathing; China; community structure; economics; recycling; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071400519

Drawing on a novel data set from the Google Play app store, the paper finds support for its hypothesis that past performance moderates the relationship between search distance and subsequent performance. As past performance increases, the less beneficial (and potentially more harmful) nonlocal search becomes. While the majority of app developers choose a nonlocal search strategy in response to low first app performance, this is rarely the best choice. Instead, the highest second app performance outcomes are associated with moderate search distances that fall between local and nonlocal extremes. Managerial Summary: This paper uses a large data set obtained from the Google Play app store to explore the following question: when a nascent app developer's first app performs poorly, how different should its second app be? By comparing the text descriptions of developers' first and second apps, the paper is able to show that as the performance of a first app increases, the more harmful it becomes to make a very different second app. Only at extremely low levels of first app performance is it beneficial for developers to make second apps that are very different from their first apps. In all other cases, making second apps that are moderately different—rather than very similar or very different—is associated with the highest second app performance. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","entrepreneurship; organizational learning; pivot; problemistic search; rugged landscapes","Management; Planning; entrepreneurship; Organizational learning; pivot; problemistic search; rugged landscapes; Search engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070500495

We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially “place their bets,” so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially “place their bets.” In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","attribution theory; boards of directors; CEO compensation; political ideology; strategic risk-taking","Risk management; attribution theory; Boards of directors; CEO compensations; Political ideologies; Strategic risk takings; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067884561

To identify a new model with better prediction of business failure of the construction contractors, this study utilized long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). The financial ratios of the construction contractors in the United States were collected, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and Tomek links were employed to obtain a balanced data set. The proposed LSTM RNN model was evaluated by comparing its accuracy and F1-score with feedforward neural network (FNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models for the optimized parameters selected from a grid search with five-fold cross-validation. The results successfully demonstrate that the prediction performance of the proposed LSTM RNN model outperforms FNN and SVM models for both test and original data set. Therefore, the proposed LSTM RNN model is a promising alternative to assist managers, investors, auditors, and government entities in predicting business failure of construction contractors, and can also be adapted to other industry cases. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Business failure; Construction contractors; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Prediction model; Recurrent neural network (RNN)","Brain; Contractors; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Plant shutdowns; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Business failure; Construction contractors; Government entities; Optimized parameter; Prediction model; Prediction performance; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Long short-term memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071613643

In an attempt to close the loop of resources (i.e. products, components or materials) FMCGs can be designed with revalorisation services. In these product-service systems (PSSs) consumers are assigned a key role in closing the loops of resource flows. To understand and define this role, we dissected eighteen examples of PSSs. From this analysis, four dimensions emerged that characterise distinct aspects of the PSSs: the form of obsolescence; the change of resources from obsolete to operative or recoverable; the prerequisite activities required of consumers for revalorisation; and the facilitators of activities (i.e. investments and incentives). These dimensions were used to model four data-driven archetypical roles of consumers named after the interaction between consumers and the resource in the obsolete state, namely keep, bring, consign or abandon obsolete components. The research concluded that revalorisation always takes place in designated locations. The roles that consumers fulfil in closed-loop PSSs involve carrying out activities to position resources in such locations. The roles always come at a cost, but PSSs can be designed to reduce it. PSSs can also be designed to induce a perceivable value of obsolete resources, which can be used to increase role fulfilment. This research presents a comprehensive understanding of the roles of consumers in the specific context of closed-loop FMCGs, identifies tactics to increase the fulfilment of these roles and suggests further research on behaviours and PSSs to understand the roles of other stakeholders in various type of PSSs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Consumer behaviour; Obsolescence; Packaging; Product-service systems; Revalorisation","Consumer behavior; Economics; Obsolescence; Packaging; Circular economy; Closed loops; Data driven; Fast moving consumer goods; Four dimensions; Product-service systems; Resource flows; Revalorisation; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069886311

We are interested in which emotion will be more strongly related to whether entrepreneurial teams escalate their commitment to a currently failing venture versus terminating that venture. Using a longitudinal start-up simulation and based on data from 66 teams across 569 decision-making rounds, we find that group “hope trumps fear.” That is, the relationship between group hope and escalating commitment to a failing venture is stronger than the relationship between group fear and terminating that venture. We predict and find that team engagement mediates these relationships. We find partial support for a predicted moderation effect of group friendship strength. Theoretical implications are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of the G-20 countries over the period 1970–2016 is utilized. A vector error-correction model is used to consider the possible directions of causality among financial development, FDI and economic growth. Findings: Results suggest a cointegrating relationship among the three series. Although short-run links among the variables are mostly non-uniform, both financial development and FDI matter in the determination of long-run economic growth. Practical implications: Attention must be paid to policies that promote financial development. This, in turn, calls for fostering incentives to guarantee continued support to liberalize the economy and promoting capital openness. Additionally, financial infrastructure should be improved to improve financial innovation. The establishment of a well-developed financial market, including well-functioning banks and other financial institutions, can facilitate further investment and an easier means of raising capital to support the activities of FDI. Economic growth can ultimately be elevated through both financial development and FDI. Originality/value: The study considers a sample of the G-20 countries, which have received relatively little attention in the existing literature. In addition, the study concurrently analyses the trivariate causal relationship among financial development, FDI and economic growth, a topic on which there has been a dearth of research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Financial development; Foreign direct investment; The G-20 countries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074163817

Design/methodology/approach: Literature review indicates that CBM has advantages over conventional CM and TBM from a theoretical perspective, but it depends on continuous monitoring enhancement via advanced IoT technology. An in-depth case study was carried out to provide practical evidence that IoT enables elevator firms to achieve CBM. Findings: From a theoretical perspective, the CBM of elevators makes business sense. The challenges lie in data collection, data analysis and decision making in real-world business contexts. The main findings of this study suggest that CBM can be commercialized via IoT in the case of elevators and would improve the safety and reliability of equipment. It would, thus, make sense from technological, process and economic perspectives. Practical implications: Our longitudinal real-world case study demonstrates a practical way of making the CBM of elevators widespread. Integrating IoT and other advanced technology would improve the safety and reliability of elevator equipment, prolong its useful life, minimize inconvenience and business interruptions due to equipment downtime and reduce or eliminate major repairs, thus greatly reducing maintenance costs. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper lies in the empirical demonstration of the benefits and challenges of CBM via IoT relative to conventional CM and TBM in the case of elevators. The authors believe that this study is timely and will be valuable to firms working on similar research or commercialization strategies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Condition-based maintenance; Corrective maintenance; Internet of Things; Time-based maintenance","Decision making; Elevators; Maintenance; Condition based maintenance; Continuous monitoring; Corrective maintenance; Design/methodology/approach; Economic perspective; Internet of Things (IOT); Reliability of equipment; Time based maintenance; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062857819

The belief rule-based (BRB) inference method has been applied for risk assessment, due to its strong interpretability and high prediction accuracy. However, lots of risk factors related to R&D projects will lead to an oversized rule base when the standard BRB method is used to evaluate project performance. In this research, a novel predictive evaluation framework is proposed to address this issue, where a RS-BRB model, namely the BRB with random subspaces, is developed to assess R&D project risks in a modular way. Firstly, multiple subspaces with low dimensions are constructed by random sampling. Subsequently, a BRB subsystem is developed as a base learner in each subspace to obtain a prediction result, and the evidential reasoning rule is adopted to combine the prediction results from different BRB subsystems. The proposed model was validated using the data from R&D projects in Chinese industries. Comparative analysis results show that the proposed model has superior prediction accuracy and can overcome the problem of combinational explosions without information loss. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Belief rule-based systems; Evidential reasoning rule; Project risk assessment; Random subspaces","Forecasting; Belief rule-based systems; Comparative analysis; Evaluation framework; Evidential reasoning; Project risk assessment; Random subspaces; Research and development; Research and development projects; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064846938

Inappropriate management in agricultural production can result in increased risk of nutrient loss to the environment. Best practice in nutrient management can help to mitigate this. However, policy initiatives aimed at encouraging farmers to follow a nutrient management plan (NMP) appear to be limited in their success. We employ a typology to classify farms/farmers based on a number of policy relevant farm and farmer characteristics. The theory of planned behaviour is applied to understand the variables which influence farmers’ intentions to follow a NMP across the Republic of Ireland. The typology resulted in a total of three classes of farmers, namely ‘traditional’, 'supplementary income’ and ‘business-orientated’. The findings from the regression analysis reveal that attitude towards the outcomes of following a NMP is a weak predictor of intentions whereas subjective norm (social pressure) and perceived behavioural control (ease/difficulty) are strong predictors of intentions across the classes. Furthermore, contact with agricultural extension (a combination of one-to-one and group based extension) is found to be critical in determining the intentions of both traditional and supplementary income classes of farmers. The results also indicate that policy, which requires certain farmers in Ireland to develop a NMP on a mandatory basis, has consistent but mixed levels of influence on intentions. Initiatives designed to further encourage farmers to follow a NMP must account for the diversity that exists among the farming population and how different groups of farmers may respond to such initiatives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Farmer decision making; Intentions; Latent class analysis; Nutrient management plan; Theory of planned behaviour","Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Behavioral research; Decision theory; Nutrients; Regression analysis; Agricultural productions; Intentions; Latent class analysis; Nutrient management; Nutrient management plans; Perceived behavioural controls; Republic of Ireland; Theory of planned behaviour; Decision making; agricultural extension; agricultural policy; agricultural production; decision making; farmers attitude; fertilizer application; nutrient enrichment; typology; agricultural land; agricultural worker; article; decision making; human; Ireland; latent class analysis; nutrient management; regression analysis; social problem; Theory of Planned Behavior; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063759190

Based on public opinion surveys, within some demographic groups, over three-quarters of individuals confirm that they have given inaccurate information in response to data requests. Obviously, firms that embrace a covert assumption of honesty in online data disclosures are deluding themselves and are likely falling into the trap of “garbage in, garbage out” in their segmenting and targeting. Despite the frequency and importance of falsification, however, it has received scant attention in the privacy research stream. Most researchers focus on the act of disclosure (and its counter-construct, withholding of data)and overlook that many of the data elements being disclosed may in fact be falsified. To address this weakness in the literature stream, we develop a nomological model that predicts both falsification and withholding behavior, and we test it using a sample collected with the assistance of an online panel provider. We find strong support for the model and show how context could play a significant role in moderating some of the proposed relationships. We then discuss important implications for practice and research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Context; Disclosure; Falsification; Information privacy; Personal data; Privacy tradeoff; Withholding","Crime; Data privacy; Decision making; Social aspects; Context; Disclosure; Falsification; Information privacy; Withholding; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057276621

As one of the active advocates as well as a vigorous promoter of eco-developments, China has initiated and implemented a vast number of eco-projects in a variety of geographical locations and with diverse scales. Despite claims to integrate economic with social and environmental objectives, research on eco-city practices suggest that mainstream eco-developments promote, first and foremost, economic growth, and largely ignore issues such as environmental well-being and social equity. There is a pressing need to better understand why the environment is being so marginalized in so-called eco-developments and what the implications of that might be for environmental quality. To investigate these issues, we adopt a political ecology perspective as this enables us to focus on local insights into resource use and access to resources. By doing so we can point to ways in which resource efficiency fluctuates over time. We select Chongming Island as our case study because of its central role in eco-development in China. Indeed, the Island is of global significance and gained global repute because it was the proposed site of the world's first dedicated eco-city. We draw upon detailed fieldwork, including reports, planning documents, key person interviews and discussions with residents to analyse how local people perceive proposals for eco-development on their Island and how ongoing state management of the Island may have unintended adverse consequences for environmental quality, especially for water and land. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Ecology; Economics; Urban growth; Chongming islands; Economic growths; Environmental governances; Environmental quality; Geographical locations; Political ecology; Resource efficiencies; Social and environmental; Landforms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063113074

One common way this occurs is when servers are hierarchical in their skills or in the level of service they can provide. Much of the literature studying such systems relies on an understanding of the relative costs and benefits associated with serving different customer types by the different levels of service. In this work, we focus on estimating these costs and benefits in a complex healthcare setting where the major differentiation among server types is the intensity of service provided. Step-down units (SDUs) were initially introduced in hospitals to provide an intermediate level of care for semicritically ill patients who are not sick enough to require intensive care but not stable enough to be treated in the general medical/surgical ward. One complicating factor is that the needs of customers is sometimes uncertain-specifically, it is difficult to know a priori which level of care a particular patient needs. Using data from 10 hospitals from a single hospital network, we take a data-driven approach to classify patients based on severity and empirically estimate the clinical and operational outcomes associated with routing these patients to the SDU. Our findings suggest that an SDU may be a costeffective way to treat patients when used for patients who are post-ICU (intensive care unit). However, the impact of SDU care is more nuanced for patients admitted from the emergency department and may result in increased mortality risk and hospital length of stay for patients who should be treated in the ICU. Our results imply that more study is needed when using SDU care this way. © 2018 INFORMS.","Congestion; Empirical operations management; Healthcare; Quality of service","Cost benefit analysis; Health care; Patient treatment; Quality of service; Sales; Congestion; Costs and benefits; Data-driven approach; Emergency departments; Empirical investigation; Empirical operations managements; Hospital networks; Intermediate level; Intensive care units",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059851651

However, they tend to operate in an automatic rather than autonomous way. This reflects the attitudes and behaviors that individuals and organizations share when adopting new technology in this industry. This paper clarifies the factors that are preventing one important aspect of autonomy-adaptive mission planning (AMP)-from transitioning from research to commercial and bespoke AUVs. A total of 25 experts comprising AUV developers and users, with combined 237 years of experience, provided their views in a structured survey covering several different hypotheses. There is insufficient evidence to determine clearly a single reason for failure to adopt AMPs, but a primary cause is the paucity of demonstration trials. This view is irrespective of participants' years of experience. Managers, engineers, and technologists agree on the two most likely causes for failure to adopt AMPs. However, the differences between the assessments provided by researchers and these three professional groups are statistically significant, with p value <0.005.

Despite the popularity of SEZs as a policy tool in virtually all developing countries around the world, there is little evidence to date which systematically analyses this question. This paper sheds light on this topic by examining the economic growth spillovers generated by 346 SEZs in 22 emerging countries. The analysis uses night light data as a proxy for SEZ performance as well as the economic performance of the surrounding area in order to overcome the lack of reliable economic indicators when measuring SEZ performance. It also relies on a novel data set on SEZ characteristics in order to understand how far they impinge on the economic fortunes of the surrounding areas. The results Indicate that SEZs have a positive impact on the economic performance of the areas surrounding the zones. However, the growth spillovers are limited in area and display a strong distance decay effect: the magnitude of the impact decreases continuously up to 50 km. Furthermore, zones located in more remote areas seem to have less of an impact on neighbouring areas. Moreover, factors assumed to have a facilitating effect, such as the manufacturing base in the country and political stability, do not seem to matter on a structural basis. © 2019 UNCTAD United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Based on the Porter hypothesis and panel data from 2001 to 2011, this study conducts empirical research on the intensity of environmental regulation and industrial green transformation in China. The results indicate that environmental regulation can effectively promote industrial green transformation by improving green total factor productivity (G.T.F.P.). But there is no simple linear relationship between the two. And there is a threshold effect, that is, the degree of influence of environmental regulation on industrial green transformation can change with the change of threshold value. Therefore, government policy should not focus only on the environmental regulation intensity, which cannot efficiently improve the G.T.F.P., or accelerate the green transition process. Instead, government should adopt different environmental policies in different industrial sectors. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Though performance benchmarking has been practically and theoretically developed in distinct fields such as banking, education, health, and so on, benchmarking of supply chains with multiple echelons that include certain characteristics such as intermediate measure differs from other practices. In spite of incremental benchmarking activities in practice, there is the dearth of a unified and effective guideline for benchmarking in organizations. Amongst the benchmarking tools, data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a non-parametric technique has been widely used to measure the relative efficiency of firms. However, the conventional DEA models that are bearing out precise input and output data turn out to be incapable of dealing with uncertainty, particularly when the gathered data encompasses natural language expressions and human judgements. In this paper, we present an imprecise network benchmarking for the purpose of reflecting the human judgments with the fuzzy values rather than precise numbers. In doing so, we propose the fuzzy network DEA models to compute the overall system scale and technical efficiency of those organizations whose internal structure is known. A classification scheme is presented based upon their fuzzy efficiencies with the aim of classifying the organizations. We finally provide a case study of the airport and travel sector to elucidate the details of the proposed method in this study. © 2019 EDP Sciences.","DEA; Fuzzy sets; Internal structure; Scale and relative efficiency measure","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy sets; Supply chains; Benchmarking activity; Classification scheme; Internal structure; Natural language expressions; Non-parametric techniques; Performance benchmarking; Relative efficiency; Technical efficiency; Benchmarking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070366386

We study the problem of devising an appropriate opinion management strategy (or response strategy) for a firm to respond to online customer reviews. To unravel the underlying mechanics of the problem, we develop a stochastic differential equation model that describes the evolution of review ratings over time for a given response strategy employed by the firm. This model is validated using data on online customer reviews and firm responses from two of the world's largest online travel agents. When pitted against popular benchmark models, such as autoregressive moving average, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity, moving average, exponential smoothing, and naive method, our approach not only achieves comparable (often better) predictive performance, it is also able to incorporate the response strategy into the data-generation process underlying the reviewratings.Our approach, therefore, is not just predictive, but,more importantly, one that can be used in a prescriptive sense, namely to prescribe a response strategy that controls review ratings in a desired manner. We operationalize the theoretical response strategy in our stochastic model to an operational prescription that a firm can implement and show the applicability of our approach for different business objectives, such as mean control, meanvariance control, and service-level control. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the stochastic differential equation model by extending it to encompass multiple state variables. © 2019 INFORMS.","Customer opinion management; Response strategy; Stochastic differential equation model","Benchmarking; Differential equations; Sales; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive moving average; Exponential smoothing; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Online customer reviews; Predictive performance; Response strategies; Stochastic differential equation models; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068595223

In this study, we focus on factories in the Bangladesh ready-made garment industry that supplies North American and European retailers. These retailers have adopted an innovative approach toward improving the working conditions of supplier factories by forming consortiums. The consortium of North American retailers is the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (“Alliance”). The consortium of European retailers is the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (“Accord”). The central question addressed in this study is the following: How do working conditions in a supplier factory impact the supplier’s trustworthiness from a retailer’s perspective? We characterize supplier factory working conditions in terms of three types of risks, namely, structural risk, fire risk, and electrical risk. Next, we examine the implications of each type of risk for supplier trustworthiness measured as the number of retailers contracting with the supplier factory. The empirical analysis is conducted using archival data on safety inspections from the Alliance and Accord. The results support the contention that retailers are sensitive to working condition risks in a supplier factory; that is, as working condition risks in a supplier factory increase, the supplier’s trustworthiness decreases. However, these associations vary with the type of risk. Specifically, fire and electrical risks are associated with decreased supplier trustworthiness, while structural risk has a marginal effect. Furthermore, the negative associations between working condition risks and supplier trustworthiness are moderated by the size of the supplier factory such that the negative associations are significantly attenuated for larger-sized supplier factories compared to the smaller-sized factories. The study findings, taken together, provide nuanced insights into the marketplace implications of working condition risks in supplier factories and highlight the sensitivity of the retailer–supplier relationship to such risks. These findings also provide actionable guidance on how to manage working condition risks. © 2018 INFORMS","Emerging economies; Empirical research; Global supply chains; Socially responsible operations; Working conditions","Developing countries; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Sales; Supply chains; Emerging economies; Empirical research; Global supply chain; Socially responsible operations; Working conditions; Occupational risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055495234

The advantages of service subscription still remain with heterogeneous customers differing on multiple dimensions including the nominal utility, uncertainty in the need of ancillary service, and purchase frequency. We find that if the product quality for both firms, measured by nominal utility, is not significantly different, more fierce price competition by offering a service subscription may result in a higher customer surplus, compared with that without a service subscription.

Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, Johansen Cointegration test, and Granger Causality test were applied as parts of the econometric time-series analysis approach. The empirical results demonstrate the positive effects of FDI and trade openness, and the negative effects of human capital and institutional quality on the economic growth of the Lao PDR over the 1993 to 2015 period. The findings confirm that trade openness complemented by a sufficient level of infrastructure, education, quality institutions, and transparency significantly influence economic growth and attract more FDI. Research results lend credence to the need for the Lao PDR's government to focus on improving its economic absorptive capability and economic competitiveness regionally and globally by improving wealth and resource management strategies, as failure to take this course of action could lead to the Dutch Disease effects. © 2019 Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).","Absorptive capability; Direct investment; Economic growth; Human capital; Institutional quality; Lao PDR; Trade openness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076859879

Its R&D investment was double that of 2015, five times that of 2012, and ten times that of 2011. Such a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment has raised the question of a new R&D definition and focus in the digital economy, which Amazon insists includes both “routine or periodic alterations” (traditionally classified as non-R&D) and “significant improvement” (classified as R&D). Using an empirical analysis of Amazon's R&D model as a system, this paper attempts to provide a convincing answer to this question. It has been identified that Amazon, which is based on R&D as a culture, has been promoting companywide experimentation to cause customers obsessed with making purchase decisions. This obsession has enabled Amazon to deploy an architecture for participation that makes the most of digital technologies by harnessing the power of users. Such user-driven innovation has accelerated a dramatic advancement of the Internet that, in turn, has accelerated the co-emergence of soft innovation resources in the marketplace. This emergence has activated a self-propagating function that has induced functionality development, leading to supra-functionality beyond an economic value that satisfies a shift in customers’ preferences. While this system depends on the assimilation capacity of soft innovation resources, Amazon has developed a high level of capacity supported by a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment. The above efforts function in a virtuous cycle leading to the transformation of “routine or periodic alterations” into “significant improvement.” These findings give rise to insightful suggestions regarding a new concept of R&D in neo open innovation in the digital economy. © 2019 The Authors","Amazon; Neo open innovation; R&D; Transformation; User-driven innovation","Investments; Sales; Amazon; Digital technologies; Empirical analysis; Open innovation; Purchase decision; Research and development; Transformation; User-driven innovation; Economics; conceptual framework; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; high technology industry; industrial performance; innovation; research and development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066954830

Our framework allows for analyzing technical efficiency and deriving a system of internal shadow prices to quantify the overall value as well as the marginal impact of implementing socially responsible activities. The empirical application focuses on the food and beverage manufacturing sector where we encounter high levels of technical efficiency among the firms included in the analysis. Our findings also document a positive average shadow price of CSR activities, implying that the net value of implementing these activities is positive as their benefit exceeds the cost. Regarding the value at the margin, we show that increasing the socially responsible commitment positively contributes to the creation of firm value. Conversely, reducing the CSR engagement has a negative marginal impact, indicating that firms perceive lower levels of CSR as very costly and damaging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Data envelopment analysis; Decision processes; Productivity and competitiveness; Shadow values","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Social aspects; Average shadow price; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Decision process; Manufacturing sector; Primal-dual approach; Productivity and competitiveness; Shadow value; Technical efficiency; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062062772

While this has been a useful approach, recent research indicates that not all new technologies follow the pattern of the hype-cycle as originally envisaged by Gartner. Programmatic Advertising (PA)is a multi-billion dollar business that uses web-based technologies to deliver highly personalised adverts to prospective consumers in real time. Despite its rapid growth it has received precious little scholarly attention. This study is therefore of interest to PA system developers and adopters since most have little understanding of its operation and limitations, and are poorly equipped to make informed decisions about its adoption and use. Through the construction of a Concept Map of the system and the development of four future states of Programmatic Advertising development, consumer concerns over the ethical usage of data and the real return on investment are issues that are identified as requiring the immediate attention of platform developers in order to mitigate the deleterious effects of hype-cycle decline.

The purpose of this paper is to identify potential barriers that hinder organisations from applying big data solutions in their smart factory initiatives, as well as to explore causal relationships between these barriers. Design/methodology/approach: The study followed an inductive and exploratory nature. Ten in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a group of highly experienced SAP consultants and project managers. The qualitative data collected were then systematically analysed by using a thematic analysis approach. Findings: A comprehensive set of barriers affecting the implementation of big data solutions in smart factories had been identified and divided into individual, organisational and technological categories. An empirical framework was also developed to highlight the emerged inter-relationships between these barriers. Originality/value: This study built on and extended existing knowledge and theories on smart factory, big data and information systems research. Its findings can also raise awareness of business managers regarding the complexity and difficulties for embedding big data tools in smart factories, and so assist them in strategic planning and decision making. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barriers; Big data; Information systems; Smart factory","Advanced Analytics; Decision making; Embeddings; Information systems; Information use; Managers; Barriers; Business managers; Causal relationships; Data and information; Design/methodology/approach; Inter-relationships; Potential barriers; Semi structured interviews; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066986548

Yet, stakeholder concerns can establish important barriers to diffusion. We study the human capital aspect of this challenge and investigate whether innovative firms pay salary premiums to new hires with work experience from advocacy groups like Transparency International. We integrate strategic human capital with stakeholder theory and suggest that advocacy group experience creates signals for valuable human capital in terms of stakeholder knowledge and legitimacy transfers to innovative firms. Using matched data for 3,562 employees in Denmark, we find that new hires with advocacy group experience enjoy larger salary premiums at technologically leading firms, in occupations with direct stakeholder interaction, and for advocacy group top management. Managerial Summary: Innovation research is increasingly aware of the non-technological factors behind successful innovations. Users, regulators, or public opinion can be benevolent supporters or stingy opponents of innovations. Employees with an understanding of the needs and sensitivities of societal stakeholders should therefore be valuable to innovative firms. We find this to be the case when innovative firms hire employees from advocacy groups representing such stakeholders (e.g., Transparency International). Such employees receive higher salaries than an otherwise comparable reference group. These findings indicate that recruiting needs of innovative firms reward stakeholder experience, not merely technological expertise. They demonstrate how firms can create value in the pursuit of the public interest. Further, advocacy groups emerge as an important career stage allowing individuals to develop credible signals for stakeholder expertise. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","advocacy groups; human capital; signaling; stakeholder theory; value creation","Human resource management; Signaling; Social aspects; Transparency; Wages; Advocacy groups; Effect on employees; Human capitals; Innovation research; Stakeholder theory; Strategic human capitals; Technological factors; Value creation; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055249786

For the first time we are able to control for local spatial heterogeneity in the damage caused by a natural disaster using geo-coded plant location and unique building-level surveys. In a survival analysis of manufacturing plants, our results show that building-level damage significantly affects a plant's likelihood of failure and this effect persists for up to 7 years. Further analysis demonstrates that the plants most likely to exit as a result of earthquake damage are the least productive which is suggestive of a cleansing effect as the average productivity rate of the remaining plants increases. We also find that continuing plants experience a temporary increase in productivity following the earthquake consistent with a 'build back better' effect. In terms of local regeneration our results indicate that plant births increase in areas with more severe damage consistent with redevelopment plans for Kobe. © The Author (2017).

Finding sustainable solutions to the food and health challenges is one of the key issues that today's society urgently needs to address. Research prioritisation thus has an essential role in directing public resources to addressing these challenges. However, the processes of prioritisation among the food and health funders are rarely subject to scrutiny and the calls for democratizing science continue, as a means of enhancing both input legitimacy (with its focus on the processes of decision-making) and output legitimacy (the utility and impact of such decisions). The current study examines what conceptualisations of legitimacy (input and output) are held by the European stakeholders of the food and health research and innovation (R&I) process such as business organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and public sector organisations. We analyse stakeholder views from a series of European Awareness Scenario Workshops across nine EU countries (N = 295). The content and thematic analysis of the outputs identified six criteria determining conceptualisations of legitimacy: Influence; Representation; Procedural issues; Epistemic focus; Strategic vision; and Impact. The statistical analysis of the coded data highlighted stakeholder differences with business sector organisations being significantly less concerned about influence and representation than either NGO or public sector organisations. The results indicate that input legitimacy is of major concern to civil society and public sector actors. They reflect the wider debate about the way in which food and health R&I should be funded and policy decisions conducted, suggesting a need for better delineation of stakeholder roles and power differentials in this process. The findings are discussed with reference to the current discussions about Responsible Research and Innovation. © 2018","Food and health; Legitimacy; Priority-setting; Public engagement; Research funding; Responsible research and innovation","civil society; decision making; food policy; food quality; innovation; local participation; nongovernmental organization; public access; public sector; research program; stakeholder; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059695993

Since humans are involved in all stages of operations in companies, this health–related performance loss can negatively impact the performance of inventory systems. Despite its importance, surprisingly WE–related performance losses have not been investigated in a supply chain context. This paper, therefore, integrates WE design into a two–level (vendor–buyer) supply chain and investigates its effect on production and inventory decisions.

Using a quadratic directional distance function, we evaluate the production inefficiency and shadow prices of CO2 reduction for the seven major maize-producing provinces in China for 1996–2014. In general, the efficiency improves over time. Shandong province ranked as the top one with full efficiency considering both economic and environmental impacts as of 2014. The mean shadow price for the CO2 emission was 0.45 yuan/kg (US$75/t), whereas the province-specific shadow prices varied within the interval bounded by 0 and 0.913 yuan/ha (US$152/t). The marginal abatement cost curve was downward-sloped and indicated the need for curbing CO2 emission in areas exhibiting the highest pollution rates. Given the marginal abatement cost patterns, the transaction costs associated with implementation of the conservation practices (tillage) should not exceed 335 yuan/ha in order to ensure the welfare gains. This government-provided payment would compensate farmers for yield reductions in favor of implementing conservation practices that would substantially reduce CO2 emissions. © 2018","Carbon dioxide (CO2); China; Conservation practices; Environmental efficiency; Food Security; Maize straw; Marginal abatement cost; Shadow price","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Food supply; Public policy; China; Conservation practices; Environmental efficiency; Food security; Maize straw; Marginal abatement costs; Shadow price; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054923457

Little is known, however, about its externality in the broader app market. This work estimates the spillover effects of WeChat on the other top 50 most frequently used apps in China, using users’ weekly app usage data. Given the challenge of determining causal inference from observational data, we apply a graphical model and an econometric method to estimate the spillover effects in two steps: (1) we determine the causal structure by estimating a partially ancestral diagram, using a fast causal inference algorithm; and (2) given the causal structure, we find a valid adjustment set and estimate the causal effects by an econometric model with the adjustment set for controlling noncausal effects. Our findings show that the spillover effects of WeChat are limited; in fact, only two other apps, Tencent News and Taobao, receive positive spillover effects from WeChat. In addition, we show that if researchers fail to account for the causal structure that is determined from the graphical model, it is easy to fall into the trap of confounding bias and selection bias when estimating causal effects. The findings generate managerial implications in terms of app usage patterns, strategic management of mega apps on an app platform, and app promotional strategies for app platform managers and app developers.

The technology of the product evolves as a real-valued stochastic process that depends on the firm’s dynamic efforts over time. In addition to dynamically choosing its development effort, the firm chooses when to launch or abandon the product. If the firm launches the product, the firm also chooses a selling price, a promotional price, and a target customer to offer the promotion to. Once the target customer adopts the product, the product diffuses over the customer network based on the topology of the graph and the selling price. The product provides local network benefits to its adopters. The expected local network benefit of adoption is proportional to the number of neighbor customers that have already adopted the product. In a continuous-time setting, we explicitly solve the firm’s jointly optimal development, launch, and post-launch strategies for any connected network. We introduce metrics that allow ordering customer networks with respect to the firm’s optimal expected discounted profit, launch technology, and consumer surplus.

Using data on 545 U.S. medical device manufacturers' product portfolios and sales-governance choices (i.e., internal or external sales forces) from 1983 to 1996, we find relational capital between manufacturers and external sales forces influences future firm boundary decisions. Relational capital lowers the likelihood of integrating the sales function, but only when firms remain focused on the same product market. Further, launching an innovative product has a nuanced effect. For firms lacking relational capital, innovation increases the likelihood of sales integration. This pattern reverses as relational capital accumulates, but only when innovations are in the firm's existing focal product market. Our findings suggest important limits on the effect of relational governance on firm strategy. Managerial Summary: Choosing between in-house or external sales is a key strategic decision. In the medical device industry, this decision is particularly important because salespeople are conduits between R&D and customers. For firms who initially choose external sales, the trade-off between maintaining existing links (via external sales) and developing new, direct relationships (by bringing sales in-house) can change significantly as product portfolios change. Analyzing 545 U.S. medical device manufacturers from 1983 to 1996, we find that existing relationships with external sales forces reduce the likelihood of bringing sales in-house, but only when firms remain in the same product market, such as orthopedic implants. When firms launch products in new markets, especially innovations, they are more likely to bring sales in-house. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","firm boundaries; innovation; medical devices; relational governance; sales strategy","Biomedical equipment; Economic and social effects; Implants (surgical); Manufacture; Firm boundaries; Inter-organizational relationships; Medical device industry; Medical device manufacturers; Medical Devices; Relational governances; Sales strategies; Strategic decisions; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055515741

RM can be roughly divided into two categories defined by the control mechanism that increases revenue: capacity allocation or price optimization. Our work falls in the latter category. In our model, we allow for partial substitutability among products (e.g., a customer making a purchase decision may consider multiple alternatives—different departure dates, different destinations, different cabin types). We also include marketing expense in addition to prices as a lever for increasing revenue. These features are relevant to dynamic pricing in practice. The method is illustrated with booking data from a cruise company, yielding optimal advertising and prices for 300 products.

The paper tackles estimation challenges posed by insufficient parking information. The first challenge is the estimation of parking prices for those who do not drive, which is addressed by using a sample selection model. The second challenge is to understand the effect of the extent of the prevalence of Employer-Paid parking coupled with incentive programs offered in-lieu of parking. To address this challenge, two extreme scenarios are examined, and a range for the marginal effects of parking prices is estimated; one scenario assumes everyone receives Employer-Paid parking coupled with in-lieu of parking incentives, and the second assumes that no one is offered such incentives. The results suggest that higher parking prices reduce driving, regardless of the followed approach. It is estimated that a 10% increase in parking prices leads to a 1–2 percentage point decline in the probability of driving to work. This range varies with initial parking prices, where the lower end of the range increases at a decreasing rate, and the higher end peaks at $2.5 and decreases with higher prices. Moreover, there seems to be no evidence of sample selection bias. The evidence confirms that parking pricing can indeed be an effective transportation demand management tool. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cash-out program; Commute mode choice; Employer-paid parking; Parking prices; Transportation demand management","Motor transportation; Cash-out program; Discrete choice models; Household travel surveys; Mode choice; Parking informations; Sample selection bias; Sample selection models; Transportation demand management; Costs; commuting; discrete choice analysis; household survey; incentive; numerical model; parking; travel demand; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073034736

First, behavioural theories on how elements of performance management can affect organisational performance are examined. Second, theoretical models on how perceptions of work conditions may impact well-being and performance are considered. Direct and indirect pathways from performance management to productivity/quality are inferred. Design/methodology/approach: Matched employee-workplace data from an economy-wide survey in Britain and two-level structural equation models are used to test the hypothesised associations. Findings: The use of practices in workplaces is inconsistent with a unified performance management approach. Distinct outcomes are expected from separate components in performance management and some may be contingent on workplace size. For example, within quality planning, strategy dissemination is positively associated with workplace productivity; targets are negatively associated with perceptions of job demands and positively correlated with job satisfaction, which in turn can increase workplace productivity. With respect to information and analysis: keeping and analysing records, or monitoring employee performance via appraisals that assess training needs, are positively associated with workplace productivity and quality. Originality/value: This paper illustrates how control in quality management can be effective. Although the merits of performance management are subject to ongoing debate, arguments in the literature have tended to focus on performance appraisal. Analyses of economy-wide data linking performance management practices, within quality management, to employee perceptions of work conditions, well-being and aggregate performance are rare. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee perceptions of work conditions; Performance; Performance management; Productivity; Quality; Quality management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075064952

Our econometric results reveal that the impact on plant sales can be considerable, although the effects are relatively short-lived. Annual total costs to Chinese plants from typhoons are estimated to be in the range of US$ 3.2 billion (2017 prices), or about 1 per cent of average turnover. When we examine the channels by which plants react to a storm event we find that there is some buffering through an increase in debt and a reduction in liquidity. In terms of propagating the shock through foreign or domestic channels, our estimates suggest that plants prefer to reduce sales to domestic buyers more than foreign buyers and purchases from foreign rather than domestic suppliers. We also find some evidence of a negative indirect effect on turnover through spillovers from customers and a positive effect through damage to very nearby competitors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","China; Economic impact; Plants; Typhoons; Wind field model","Costs; Manufacture; Sales; Storms; China; Chinese manufacturers; Direct and indirect impacts; Economic impacts; Manufacturing plant; Plant performance; Plants; Wind field modeling; Hurricanes; cost analysis; economic impact; environmental economics; estimation method; model; storm track; typhoon; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071238471

Climate change is already causing changes in the distribution and abundance of many of the fish stocks that support fisheries, resulting in overfishing and conflicts arising from changes in access to fisheries and in the distribution of fishery benefits. If business continues as usual, these problems will likely get worse, with 80% of the worlds stocks falling into an overfished status by the middle of the next decade. This does not have to be the case. Many fishery challenges posed by climate change, such as changes in stock abundance and distribution, are familiar. Fisheries have developed effective ways to address them, such as harvest control rules that vary with climate regime, frequent monitoring, and adaptive management systems. However, many of these approaches are not yet widespread. Indeed more than 80% of the world's catch is derived from stocks without a formal stock assessment, which makes implementation of robust forms of management problematic. Moreover, climate change is introducing new kinds of challenges, such as the introduction of new species into fisheries.

On average, an increase in the material flow of the targeted metals was found to be correlated with a deterioration in approximately 10% of the 96 indicators. Among the affected SDGs, the adverse impact of metals on SDG 3 (Health), SDG 8 (Economic Growth), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)was particularly noteworthy.

While good institutions stabilize the structure of exchange and decrease uncertainty in market transactions, institutional reform may involve institutional volatility. If institutional volatility increases uncertainty, it can mitigate the benefits of reform. Using a sample of 89 countries from 2000-2015, this paper empirically examines the effects of institutional volatility on economic growth. We find that institutional volatility decreases economic growth, particularly during liberalization for countries with low quality institutions and low income. In fact, a one standard deviation increase in volatility decreases growth by about 0.50 percentage points. This finding is robust to multiple estimation techniques and omitted variable bias. Evidence is provided suggesting that this effect is partially mediated through volatility's impact on private investment. These results support prior works that policy makers should pursue economic freedom, but our work indicates they should do so along a stable reform path to maximize economic growth. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"economic growth; economic planning; economic reform; institutional framework; institutional reform; liberalization; market conditions; reform process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063258396

An assumption often made is that delivery time is independent of delivery processes that are not typically associated with drive time, such as loading. This can be acceptable for comparing alternate types of surface delivery vehicles, but not when comparing surface delivery vehicles with drones. To address this issue, empirical store-to-consumer deliveries are collected from a retail establishment in the United States and used to design and calibrate a discrete event simulation model to match the retailer's delivery process. Using this model, drones are compared with surface vehicles under alternate changes of state.

Six workers acknowledged the presence of ability and genuine benevolence within their workplace. However, they identified lack of company integrity from their management regarding OSH practices. Fourteen workers identified ability, genuine benevolence and company integrity qualities and that their management adhere to sets of principles that they find acceptable and consistent.

Given the concern over the impact that model uncertainty is likely to have on the stochastic frontier model in practice, the present research proposes two distinct model averaging estimators, one which averages over nested classes of inefficiency distributions and another that has the ability to average over distinct distributions of inefficiency. Both of these estimators are shown to produce optimal weights when the aim is to uncover conditional inefficiency at the firm level.

However, little is known about the mechanisms behind selection of different types of incentives. Our laboratory experiment characterizes the ways in which male and female decision-makers assign incentives, and how these choices are perceived by those affected by them. We find that women are significantly less likely to select “competitive” incentives based on comparative performance of workers, particularly in the treatment where their workers can observe their gender. The results are not due to priming but are rather consistent with the explanation that women conform to gender stereotypes in anticipation of subsequent evaluation by workers. Indeed, female decision-makers are significantly underrated relative to comparable males, even after controlling for incentive choice and an extensive set of individual characteristics. The gender difference in competency ratings can be attributed to male workers rating female decision-makers disproportionately lower relative to their male counterparts. The gender gap in ratings appears to arise because of gender per se and not due to a differential impact of incentives on decision-makers' gender. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"competition (economics); decision making; female; gender issue; gender role; incentive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061213901

In addition, there are many different types of mitigation measures, from supply-side investment solutions to demand-side efficiency improvements, which may interact, risking double-counting of abatement potentials. This paper presents a novel, transparent methodology for building a marginal abatement cost curve that allows abatement costs and potentials to be compared. This curve improves over existing methods as it allows for abatement measures to be pursued in parallel, takes into account the interplay between abatement measures and captures data on cost uncertainty. The method is applied to build the first bottom-up marginal abatement cost curve for greater material efficiency steel use in the UK. This curve is demonstrated via four material efficiency measures which do not require large changes in final uses of products: reusing steel beams in construction, specifying optimal lightweight beams in construction, choosing smaller cars and specifying high strength steel car bodies. The results show that these strategies could reduce UK steel demand and associated global emissions by approximately 12%. 17% of this potential would be viable at the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) 2030 carbon price for policy appraisal (79 £/t CO2) taking into account emissions savings associated with steel demand only. Once use-phase emissions savings are taken into account this share increases to 60%. These results can be traced directly back to underlying assumptions regarding costs and emissions allocations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","MACC; Material efficiency; Policy guidance","Cost estimating; Greenhouse gases; High strength steel; Industrial emissions; Investments; Uncertainty analysis; Abatement potentials; Efficiency improvement; Industrial strategies; MACC; Marginal abatement cost curves; Material efficiency; Mitigation measures; Policy guidance; Cost benefit analysis; steel; abatement cost; biomass allocation; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; uncertainty analysis; Article; building industry; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost control; environmental policy; marginal abatement cost curve; material efficiency; productivity; recycling; United Kingdom; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060228764

In the existing literature, chance constrained DEA includes E-model and P-model. The E-model maximizes functions related to the expectation of random inputs and outputs. The P-model maximizes the probability of stochastic events related to the random inputs and outputs. However, optimization methods for solving these models lack a formulation to convert the resulting DEA models into tractable optimization methodologies. The current study examines the nonlinearity of the chance constrained DEA models by identifying and reformulating tractable optimization models into conic optimization problems. We relax the uncorrelation assumption which is usually adopted in the existing chance constrained DEA models. We extend chance constrained DEA from the Gaussian model to a distributionally robust model in order to deal with datasets where distributions of random inputs and outputs are only partially known in advance.

Special attention is given to the impact of efficiency versus flexibility on firm performance, and on what the simulations reveal concerning successful strategies in each environment and firm type. Design/methodology/approach: Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations based on Ashby's Requisite Variety principle. Findings: Efficiency and flexibility do not, in general, determine performance. However, certain strategies appear to be superior, and in turbulent business environments, efficiency and flexibility appear well correlated with firm performance. Research limitations/implications: Implications and limitations of the Law of Requisite Variety for strategic analysis are set forth. Limitations stem from the simplifications needed for quantitative analysis, and lack of explicit consideration of competitors’ actions. Practical implications: The simulations’ realism offers insights to strategists regarding the roles of efficiency and flexibility in firm performance. The quantitative approach provides unambiguous definitions for some terms used in strategy, sharpening concepts put forth by Ashby and by Ansoff. Originality/value: A back-to-basics, systems approach to the simulations, using the venerable and general requisite variety principle as its basis, ensures sound analysis and appeal to readers who may come to it from diverse traditions of strategy theory.

While prior research has emphasized the buyer's ability to manage the supplier's interface, this research takes a supplier perspective and investigates under which circumstances a supplier's interorganizational information processing capability (IIPC) drives the supplier's component development performance. We take a contingency view and theorize that the effect of the supplier's IIPC is either amplified or dampened by three sources of buyer-incurred project uncertainty: a buyer's component novelty, a buyer's engineering change orders (ECOs), and a buyer's knowledge protectiveness. The hypotheses are tested with data collected from 103 supplier component development projects in South Korea. As a result, this study empirically demonstrates the significant effects of a supplier's IIPC in enhancing the supplier's component development performance. In addition, we substantiate that the magnitude of a buyer's ECOs positively amplifies the benefits of the supplier's IIPC, while the buyer's knowledge protectiveness significantly hampers it.

Though the relationship between consumer reviews and sales has been extensively studied, only few studies have been conducted on the effects of different review designs. In this paper, we collect detailed review data from Meituan.com, a popular Chinese shopping website, to examine the effects of numerical presentation of consumer reviews (detailed to one decimal place) and graphical presentation of consumer reviews (in half-stars) on sales. By using a regression discontinuity design, we find that while consumer review scores may affect sales positively, the star presentation can create negative, rather than positive, jumps at cutoffs. Consumers restrict their attention to a star category; therefore, the “best” sellers in a lower star category are better off than the “worst” sellers in a higher star category. The incentive for review manipulation is strongly reduced, which in the long run will create trust and confidence for the review system as well as the sellers. For those sellers that are just below the cutoffs, simply crossing over the cutoffs would not lead to higher sales. Instead, they will have to substantially improve their service quality to attract consumers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer review; E-commerce; Regression discontinuity","Decision making; Electronic commerce; Regression analysis; Sales; Business decisions; Consumer reviews; Graphical presentations; Online consumer reviews; Online retailers; Regression discontinuity; Service Quality; Shopping websites; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051724163

These exchanges aim to improve the environment by helping industrial organizations repurpose surplus material and avoid landfill disposal. OMWEs represent an emerging surplus-driven supply network, which exhibits different internal complexities and dynamics from traditional supply networks, with similarly distinct transactional patterns and outcomes. Drawing on complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, this study investigates how the complex network adapts to alter the likelihood of transactions between buyers and suppliers. Using data from MNExchange.org, an OMWE operating in the US state of Minnesota, we observe that, at the node level, buyers adapt their searches for products over time to increase transaction success; at the dyadic level, buyer-supplier pairing patterns adapt over time through homophilous relations to facilitate negotiations and increase transaction success; and at the network level, the entire exchange system structurally selforganizes to increase transaction rates. Throughout, buyers’ competition influences transaction success, contingent on whether the product has been on the market for a long time, and buyers with more experience more quickly identify favorable conditions (among products and suppliers) leading to higher transaction success than less experienced competitors. Overall, the results demonstrate multilevel network emergence, in which complex, adaptive, and longitudinal buyer-supplier interactions resolve uncertainty and increase transactions. These findings disentangle OMWEs’ operation to allow managers and policymakers to increase the overall buyer-supplier transaction rates with an eye toward improved environmental outcomes. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","Complex adaptive systems; Online material exchanges; Surplus networks; Surplus-driven supply network; Sustainability","Adaptive systems; Commerce; Online systems; Sales; Search engines; Sustainable development; Complex adaptive systems; Empirical investigation; Environmental outcome; Favorable conditions; Industrial organization; On-line materials; Supply networks; Transactional patterns; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066158946

We hypothesize that a process network's GHG emissions will be less when the process network has a modular structure and when its constituent unit processes are more functionally similar. A modular process network architecture promotes autonomous innovation and improvements in knowledge management and problem-solving capabilities, leading to more efficient processes. Functional commonality in a process network enables economies of scale and knowledge spillover and also leads to process efficiencies, thus reducing GHG emissions.

In contrast to existing literature that tends to examine these channels separately, the combined framework developed here shows how cross-sector comparative advantage and within-sector responses to trade and environmental policy or factor endowments interact to affect our environment through three channels: changes in output, cross-sector market share, and emissions intensity. In contrast to a single-sector model with neutral productivity, consideration of two sectors allows for trade liberalization to affect the allocation of inputs in each sector and thereby affect total pollution output. The additional consideration of heterogeneous firm responses to falling trade costs will generate endogenous increases in productivity that increase output, reduce aggregate emissions intensity, and moderate the cross-sector resource adjustment, relative to a representative-firm model.

The social dimension of sustainability performance remains largely unknown. The lack of understanding of social performance, i.e., how stakeholder needs are impacted by industrial production, limits the capacity of decision makers to pursue fully informed choices. Fortunately, large quantities of economic and social data exist in the public domain. The vast economic and social data enable the creation of industry-related social impact metrics that can describe how industry directly affects society. However, assessing social impacts in an economy requires a multidisciplinary modeling approach. The proposed method, economic input-output social impact assessment, is developed to integrate economic production with two new social impact metrics based on employee/worker-needs: Cost Of Injuries identifies employee safety/security needs, and Employees below a Living Wage identifies worker basic needs. The model is applied using a case study that introduces the economically important and technologically innovative Advanced Manufacturing cluster of industries in the United States. In 2012, Advanced Manufacturing represented over 39% of U.S. manufacturing output and 7.8%, or $2.25 trillion. of the U.S. total economic output ranking 6th in the total economy. As a result of the model, Advanced Manufacturing was attributed 8.5%, or $1.3 billion, for the total national social impacts of Cost Of Injuries, ranking 5th in the U.S. economy. Advanced Manufacturing was also attributed 3.5%, or 3 million employees, for the total national social impacts of Employees below a Living Wage, ranking 12th out of the 16 economic sectors studied. The economic input-output social impact assessment method is demonstrated to provide a measurable path forward to evaluate the social performance of industries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced manufacturing; Economic allocation; Industrial social performance; Input-output method; Social impact metrics","Decision making; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Industrial economics; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Wages; Advanced manufacturing; Industrial sustainability; Input-output methods; Multi-disciplinary modeling; Social impact; Social impact assessments; Social performance; Sustainability performance; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059308405

At the same time, the theory is not homogenous nor compartmentalized, although some main themes do seem to be prevalent. The latter include innovation, competitiveness, strategy, and policy. Through an inclusive analysis of the literature, data mining is attempted within this body of knowledge. A dominant instance within the literature is the existence of a strategic case, along with the fact that this is rooted within a recurring constellation of topics vested within strategic management. These occurrences are categorized per generic premise, according to a coding protocol. The data is then adjusted into dichotomous variables, to investigate dependent samples’ correlation. The aim of this methodology is to examine association between the categorical variables of academic impact and the presence of a strategic case. The results of the analysis are statistically significant. This research can provoke novel directions with respect to strategic and tactical decision making, for academia and practice.

However, its successful realisation for preventing the production of waste, while increasing efficiencies in the uses of energy and human capital remains a highly convoluted problem. This research article aims to address this issue by presenting an innovative uncertainty-based framework that can be used to assist in achieving increased sustainability within the context of IPS2. The developed framework explains the drivers for decision-making and cost to enable sustainability improvements in transforming to industrial services. This is based on academic literature, and multiple case studies of seven industrial companies with over 30 h of semi-structured interviews. The validation of the framework through two case studies demonstrates that uncertainty management can enable resource efficiency and offer sustainable transformation to service provision. © 2018 The Authors","Contracts; Industrial services; Sustainability; Transformation; Uncertainty","Contracts; Decision making; Environmental impact; Environmental sustainability; Industrial product service systems; Industrial services; Resource efficiencies; Semi structured interviews; Transformation; Uncertainty; Uncertainty management; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055972576

An effective method to resolve these problems is sustainable space management (SSM), which is a particularly good fit for nonprofit elderly facilities with limited capital budgets. However, one critical barrier to SSM is the lack of a sustainability measurement model in recent studies and practices. To overcome this barrier, this paper first develops a conceptual sustainability framework with five elements, or sustainability dimensions (SDs): facility characteristics, facility management organization, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and social sustainability. Afterwards, an initial list of indicators evaluating the sustainability of space management is identified through a literature review and interviews with experts. Meanwhile, several hypothesized relationships among the five SDs are proposed based on experience and prior studies. A questionnaire survey to collect raw data regarding stakeholders’ views of China's elderly facilities is conducted to identify the significance of these sustainability indicators (SIs). Furthermore, a structural equation modeling analysis comprising confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis is conducted to examine the measurement model as well as the proposed hypotheses. Based on a discussion of the key SIs (KSIs), significant paths for driving sustainability in space management within elderly facilities are proposed. The findings will fill the blind spot that facility managers experience when practicing daily space management to promote sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Elderly facilities; Space management; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development","Budget control; Environmental protection; Factor analysis; Office buildings; Regression analysis; Surveys; Confirmatory factor analysis; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Space management; Structural equation modeling; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability measurements; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055967695

The role of live chat in the e-commerce environment, however, is largely underexplored. Using granular data from Alibaba, we examine the effect of live chat on consumers’ purchase decisions. After controlling for the selection process that customers with high purchase intention are more likely to initiate live chat in the first place, we find that live chat can increase purchase probability of tablets by 15.99%. We also investigate how the effect of live chat is moderated by existing information cues: product sales volume and seller feedback score. The substitutional or complementary patterns allow us to understand how live chat tools change the ways consumers evaluate product quality and seller credibility. We observe a substitutional effect of live chat on seller feedback score such that sellers with low feedback score benefit more from live chat conversations than sellers with high score. On the contrary, products with high past sales volume sell better after live chat, indicating a reinforcement effect. Such findings deepen our understanding of the difference between various information cues in electronic markets. As one of the first systematic studies to investigate live chat, our paper contributes to web trust conceptual frameworks with empirical analyses and sheds light on practical decisions faced by e-vendors and platform designers.

Organizational stages of the mechanism formation at the national level and a methodological approach to assess green electricity generation cost are developed. The modeling has shown that the annual increase in the cap for green electricity consumption by 1% will raise the electricity tariff by 3%, which is not a significant financial burden for consumers.

However, research indicates that nonrational, political behavior also determines formalized innovation portfolio management decision-making processes. Research on political behavior in respect of innovation portfolio management usually conceptualizes political behavior as a set of self-serving activities, such as negotiation, bargaining, coalition building, and acquiring power, aimed at protecting, maintaining, or promoting an actor's self-interest and power. Consequently, extant research tends to focus on political behavior's dysfunctional impacts on decision-making processes and their subsequent outcomes. This paper challenges this negativity bias by exploring a novel, neutral specification of political behavior and its relation to innovation portfolio management decision-making processes. By conducting an automotive industry case study focusing on the innovation portfolio management decision-making processes, the paper analyzed the data from 43 interviewees. The conceptual model shows that managers' political capabilities determine their ability to behave politically. According to the results, political behavior comprises the activities that prepare the stage and orchestrate others in order to form a political coalition. Furthermore, results show that political behavior functions as a sensegiving and a sensebreaking process, with managers seeking to shape an innovation project's understanding according to their interests and to influence portfolio decisions. The resulting novel specification of political behavior extends the construct's scope and validity by investigating their functional and dysfunctional aspects, and by indicating that a political sensemaking process complements formalized innovation portfolio management decision-making processes. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association",,"Automotive industry; Behavioral research; Financial data processing; Human resource management; Investments; Managers; Specifications; Conceptual model; Decision making process; Innovation projects; Negativity bias; Political behaviors; Portfolio decisions; Portfolio managements; Sensemaking; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068325418

While firms face regulatory barriers to the use of board interlock ties as a strategy for reducing competition, we suggest that firms can circumvent these barriers by appointing the friends of competitors' chief executive officers (CEOs) to their boards. Our theoretical framework addresses the antecedents, maintenance, and performance consequences of such “board-friendship ties” to rivals. Our theory explains (a) why firms form and maintain board-friendship ties, where maintenance involves the reconstitution of broken ties and (b) how firms form and maintain these ties, by revealing the role of search firms in identifying the friends of rivals' CEOs. Empirical analyses of large-sample, longitudinal survey and archival data provide substantial support for our theory. Managerial Summary: Firms can and do reduce competition and increase performance by appointing the friends of competitors' CEOs to their boards, and search firms (headhunters) play a key role in forming and maintaining these “board-friendship” ties to competitors. While board interlock ties between close competitors are illegal and direct friendship ties between CEOs of competitors are relatively rare, board-friendship ties are common, and yet largely unknown to antitrust regulators and external stakeholders. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","boards; CEOs; competition; consultants; social networks","Management; Planning; Social networking (online); Antitrust regulators; boards; CEOs; Chief executive officer; consultants; External stakeholders; Longitudinal surveys; Theoretical framework; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055587382

Unlike the promotion pricing problem that received great attention from both academics and practitioners, the promotion vehicle scheduling problem was largely overlooked, and our goal is to study this problem both theoretically and in practice. We model the problem of scheduling promotion vehicles to maximize profits as a nonlinear bipartite matching-type problem, where promotion vehicles should be assigned to time periods, subject to capacity constraints. Our modeling approach is motivated and calibrated using actual data in collaboration with Oracle Retail, leading us to introduce and study a class of models for which the boost effects of promotion vehicles on demand are multiplicative. From a technical perspective, we prove that the general setting considered is computationally intractable. Nevertheless, we develop approximation algorithms and propose a compact integer programming formulation. In particular, we show how to obtain a (1 )-approximation using an integer program of polynomial size, and investigate the performance of a greedy procedure, both analytically and computationally. We also discuss an extension that includes cross-term effects to capture the cannibalization aspect of using several vehicles simultaneously. From a practical perspective, we test our methods on actual data through a case study, and quantify the impact of our models. Under our model assumptions and for a particular item considered in our case study, we show that a rigorous optimization approach to the promotion vehicle scheduling problem allows the retailer to increase its profit by 2% to 9%. © 2018 INFORMS.","Approximation algorithms; Integer programming; Promotion optimization; Retail operations","Approximation algorithms; Commercial vehicles; Polynomial approximation; Profitability; Sales; Scheduling; Bipartite matchings; Capacity constraints; Integer programming formulations; Model assumptions; Optimization approach; Pricing problems; Retail operations; Vehicle scheduling problem; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052653861

Internal entities are entities in a supply chain that the outsourcer can manage and control. External entities are entities whose processes are not within the management sphere and control of the outsourcer, yet affect an outsourcer's performance. A slacks-based measure is incorporated into a hybrid network data envelopment analysis model to evaluate the outsourcer performance incorporating both entity types.

The modified returns-earnings regressions indicate that the information so conveyed pertains to priced risk. In corroboration, the paper also shows that the identified expected-return news forecasts changes in both stock return betas and earnings betas, and expected-return news predicts future returns, whereas cash-flow news does not. The analysis yields a number of additional insights: financial statements distinguish expected-return news associated with operations from that associated with financing activities; given accounting information, there is not much news in dividends; and, in comparing the information content of earnings versus cash flows, cash flows largely convey expected-return news rather than cash-flow news.

In this paper, we study such small traditional retailers located in the neighborhoods of big cities in emerging markets. We call them nanostores. Although modern retailing has grown in the last two decades in these markets, the number of nanostores is still increasing and serving a substantial part of the daily demand for many basic products, such as bread, milk, and cooking oil. We thus conduct an empirical study to understand the business environment of these nanostores in emerging markets by collecting data from 333 nanostores, spread over eight large cities in Morocco. We analyze the data, conduct a cluster analysis, and describe their business environment with a focus on their order behavior, which typically triggers the transportation decisions upstream in the supply chain. We find that the order information from these retailers may not be the best information to rely on when making transportation decisions. Our study also provides several interesting insights that may help organize transportation toward these nanostores in a fundamentally different way. We also discuss a number of opportunities to improve the efficiency of the supply chains that serve them. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big cities; Emerging markets; Empirical study; Goods transportation; Morocco; Nanostores; Supply chain management","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Oils and fats; Sales; Supply chain management; Thermal processing (foods); Big cities; Emerging markets; Empirical studies; Goods transportation; Morocco; Nanostores; Freight transportation; cluster analysis; empirical analysis; goods exchange; marketing; supply chain management; transportation; travel demand; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072523053

Social media stores vast amounts of publicly available data that provides a rich source of information and insights. Often, social media users can easily infer meaning from short text such as microblogs and Facebook posts because they understand the context and terminology used. Although automated data-mining can be effective for gaining insights from text data, a significant challenge is to accurately infer meaning from social media text derived from a single social media account. This is difficult because social media communication uses very short, or sparse, text, which yields a relatively small sample of usable words for analysis. Furthermore, interpreting the contextual meaning from a relatively small set of words is challenging. This research proposes a methodology for extracting semantic lexical chains from frequently occurring words in a single social media account and using these chains to mine short text structures to infer the overall themes of the user. The methodology is based on a proposed clustering algorithm and illustrated with examples from Facebook posts. The algorithm is tested and illustrated by comparing it to existing work and further applying it to a variety of news posts. This methodology could be useful for gaining decision-making insights from social media, or other online forms with short or sparse text. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Lexical chain; Semantic clustering; Short text; Social media; Text mining; Word sense disambiguation","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision making; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Text processing; Lexical Chain; Semantic clustering; Short texts; Social media; Text mining; Word Sense Disambiguation; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071970567

Hunter self-monitoring schemes hold promise, but their accuracy in estimating populations has not been verified and obtaining useful wildlife estimates from generally low-quality data remains a challenge. We tested whether wildlife indicators could be useful for wildlife monitoring in such schemes, because they might eliminate the need to estimate effort in hunter surveys, and reduce records of many species into a single informative indicator. We implemented a hunter self-monitoring scheme in eight villages in the northern Republic of Congo, collecting shotgun, snare, and camera trap records in “zones” within each village's hunting territory (shotguns = 83 zones, snares = 50 zones, cameras = 21 zones). Using each of these three survey methods, we calculated for each zone three different indicators used in wildlife studies: mean body mass, the mean intrinsic rate of increase (rmax), and a duiker index (small duikers as a percentage of small and medium sized duikers). Survey effort could be estimated for both snares and cameras and was used to estimate species relative abundances (Catch Per Unit Effort, CPUE). Mean body mass was the most effective indicator, followed by the duiker index. Both were correlated between survey methods and changed with increasing hunting pressure regardless of survey method used. They also predicted the total CPUE of animals >15 kg for zones, and often the CPUE of individual species. They also gave the most precise estimates of the three indicators, and snare estimates were more precise than shotgun. In contrast, mean rmax generally performed poorly, and was often not correlated with the other indicators, or with hunting pressure. Our findings suggest that some indicators can produce useful wildlife estimates from hunter self-monitoring schemes, that are also easy to implement and comprehend for hunters and wildlife managers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bushmeat hunting; Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM); Self-monitoring; Tropical wildlife; Wildlife indicators","Cameras; Monitoring; Natural resources management; Population statistics; Rural areas; Surveys; Bushmeat hunting; Catch per unit efforts; Intrinsic rate of increase; Natural resource management; Self-monitoring; Tropical wildlife; Wildlife monitoring; Wildlife populations; Animals; body mass; catch per unit effort; equipment; hunting; population estimation; relative abundance; survey method; tropical forest; wild population; Congo; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067232565

While a large body of research has examined UIBs, including their effect on unemployed workers, few studies investigate whether UIBs have any impact on a firm’s overall productivity. Using data on firm-level total factor productivity and state-level UIBs, we find a negative association between productivity and UIBs. We also find that the negative association is weaker for firms with higher employee-welfare indices than for firms with lower indices, suggesting that the adverse effect of higher UIBs on productivity is mitigated by policies that benefit workers’ welfare.

While improving operational efficiency of construction activities implemented by construction equipment could result in significant emission reduction, there is still a lack of practical knowledge on the impact of operational adjustments applicable in real-world operations. The objectives of this study are to identify common inefficiency of real-world construction equipment activities and quantify emission saving potentials from operation-level adjustments of construction activities. In order to achieve the goals, three construction sites were used as case studies to identify common sources of excessive emissions on construction sites as well as possible opportunities for their reduction. As the means of quantifying potential gas emission reduction, a simple method that estimates equipment cycle time and can be easily replicated in practice is introduced. It was found from the case studies that a typical problem on a construction site is unnecessary idling of equipment. In addition, findings of this study indicate that the integration of careful planning on construction equipment activities with appropriate equipment selection could contribute to the reduction of carbon gas emissions as well as savings of construction cost. It is envisaged that this study contributes to the body of knowledge by (1) providing new findings in common inefficiency of construction operation in construction sites through field studies, and (2) quantifying the potential gas emission reduction with the simple method. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction equipment; Construction operations; Efficiency analysis; Field data; Gas emissions; Sustainable development","Carbon; Construction; Construction industry; Efficiency; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Machinery; Oil field equipment; Sustainable development; Construction activities; Construction operations; Diesel exhaust emissions; Efficiency analysis; Field data; Gas emission reduction; Operational efficiencies; Real world operations; Construction equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068750840

This type of system is common in a variety of service sectors, such as healthcare, banking, and legal counseling. The majority of the existing literature assumes constant service times or does not consider customer no-shows, which are unrealistic assumptions in many situations. In this paper, we overcome this shortcoming by developing an appointment scheduling model that considers stochastic service times along with customer no-shows for multiple-provider systems with identical providers. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of customers’ waiting time, and providers’ idle time and overtime. We model this problem as a time-inhomogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain process. We use analytical results to reduce the space of optimal schedule candidates, and we employ machine learning techniques to detect patterns among optimal or near-optimal schedules. We then develop an effective heuristic method which provides schedules that perform better than the ones generated by existing models. We test our heuristic both on simulated data and a real-world application.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how players’ achievement orientation, social orientation and sense of community contribute to willingness to pay (WtP). Design/methodology/approach: A multi-method study of an online game community is used. Interviews and participant observation are used to develop an understanding of social and achievement orientations followed by the development of hypotheses that are tested using survey data. Findings: The findings indicate that a sense of community is positively related to WtP, whereas satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the service provider is not. The authors examine the moderating role of players’ achievement orientation and social orientation and find that while a stronger connection to the community may encourage achievement-oriented players to pay, the opposite is indicated for socially oriented players. Practical implications: Decision makers need to understand that not all players are potential payers; while socially oriented users can help to maintain and grow the community, achievement-oriented players are more likely to pay for the value they extract from the community. Originality/value: While communities are held together by people with common interests, which intuitively suggests that WtP increases with the strength of connection to the community, the authors find this only applies in the case of players with an achievement orientation. For those with a social orientation, WtP may actually decrease as their connection to the community increases. These perhaps counter-intuitive findings constitute a novel contribution of value for both theory and practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Achievement orientation; Mixed methods; Monetization; Online games; Social orientation","Decision making; Surveys; Achievement orientations; Design/methodology/approach; Mixed method; Monetization; On-line games; Participant observations; Theory and practice; Willingness to pay; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070313780

First, using balanced panel data from 2008 to 2017 it compares the cost efficiencies between US and Canadian commercial banks to examine whether structural differences in the two countries' banking industries create differences in efficiencies. Since efficiency is a valuable measurement to indicate the ability of an organization to utilize limited resources to produce, in this article we compare the operating competitiveness of these banks. Next, to achieve the first goal, both the Stochastic Frontier Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis are employed to examine cost efficiencies in order to find new evidence given the mixed results in previous literature. Profit efficiency is also compared with cost efficiency based on a parametric approach. The results regarding cost and profit efficiency conforms to prior studies indicating a relatively low correlation. However, SFA and DEA produce very different and uncorrelated results, though DEA generates overall lower efficiencies, as expected. Thus, the findings suggest that methodology cross-checking along with information regarding variables selection are necessary before decision making. Essentially, there is not enough evidence to conclude that bank efficiencies are different either between the US and Canada, or between large and small banks in US. However, DEA suggests an increasing trend in average efficiencies, as this parameter is not time-adjusted. A more technical exploration of how to reliably measure efficiencies is awaited to make advancements in this area. © 2019 Journal of Competitiveness.","Bank efficiency; Canadian banking; Competitiveness; Data envelopment analysis; Stochastic frontier analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084259389

A survey was also utilized better understand of how sport sales courses are being taught and uncover the perceptions of programs not offering sales. The top reasons for adding the class were the demand from the industry for qualified salespeople and a positive employment outlook. Survey results revealed that all courses were taught in a face-to-face environment with an average class size of 27, predominantly taught by a full-time faculty member in sport management. Selling in the Sport Industry authored by Pierce et al. was the most commonly used textbook. Respondents from programs not offering the course nearly universally recognized the importance of students demonstrating competence in sales by the time they graduate, and 74% reported covering sales competencies elsewhere in curriculum. Slightly over one-fourth of the programs without a sales course indicated that addition of a required class is likely in the near future. The business school was a likely place to outsource the teaching of sales competencies, with 13% of schools without a sport sales class requiring a professional selling course offered in the business school and 18% offering access to an elective.

The maximum likelihood estimator for the estimation of SDPD models can have asymptotic bias because of individual and time fixed effects. Bias arises since the limiting distributions of the score functions derived from the corresponding concentrated log-likelihood functions are not centered on zero. First, we show how the score functions should be adjusted to avoid the effect of asymptotic bias on the standard LM test statistics. Second, we further adjust score functions such that the resulting LM test statistics are valid when there is local parametric misspecification in the alternative model. Our adjusted LM test statistics can be used to test the presence of the contemporaneous spatial lag, time lag and spatial-time lag in an SDPD model.

This paper classifies, measures and evaluates the demand information for an AMoD system. First, the paper studies demand information at both individual and aggregate levels and measures two critical attributes: dynamism and granularity. We identify the trade-offs between both attributes during the data collection and information inference processes and discuss the compatibility of the AMoD dispatching algorithms with different types of information. Second, the paper assesses the value of demand information through agent-based simulation experiments with the actual road network and travel demand in a major European city, where we assume a single operator monopolizes the AMoD service in the case study area but competes with other transportation modes. The performance of the AMoD system is evaluated from the perspectives of travelers, AMoD operators, and transportation authority in terms of the overall system performance. The paper tests multiple scenarios, combining different information levels, information dynamism, and information granularity, as well as various fleet sizes. Results show that aggregate demand information leads to more served requests, shorter wait time and higher profit through effective rebalancing, especially when supply is high and demand information is spatially granular. Individual demand information from in-advance requests also improves the system performance, the degree of which depends on the spatial disparity of requests and their coupled service priority. By designing hailing policies accordingly, the operator is able to maximize the potential benefits. The paper concludes that the strategic trade-offs of demand information need to be made regarding the information level, information dynamism, and information granularity. It also offers a broader discussion on the benefits and costs of demand information for key stakeholders including the users, the operator, and the society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based simulation; Autonomous vehicles; Fleet management; Mobility-on-demand systems; Value of information","Aggregates; Autonomous agents; Autonomous vehicles; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Fleet operations; Inference engines; Information granules; Agent based simulation; Autonomous mobilities; Dispatching algorithm; Effective management; Fleet management; Information granularity; On-demand systems; Value of information; Information management; algorithm; computer simulation; mobility; transportation mode; travel demand; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060726670

Data analyses were implemented in an urban university, which provides valuable opportunities for enhancing our understanding of this type of urban system and enabling data-driven studies of neighborhood sustainability. Based on the strengths and weakness of FI and DEA identified in the empirical study, it is concluded that these two methods can be valuable yet complementary for an integrated system analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Campus metabolism; Data envelopment analysis; Fisher information; Sustainability assessment; Urban metabolism; Urban system","Data envelopment analysis; Fisher information matrix; Metabolism; Physiology; Sustainable development; Appropriate techniques; Comparative analysis; Empirical studies; Fisher information; Integrated systems; Sustainability assessment; Urban metabolisms; Urban systems; Data integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059306110

The main assumption underlying the Black–Litterman model is that asset returns and investor's views are multivariate normally distributed. However, empirical research demonstrates that the distribution of asset returns has fat tails and is asymmetric, which contradicts normality. Recent advances in risk measurement advocate replacing the variance by risk measures that take account of tail behavior of the portfolio return distribution. This paper extends the Black–Litterman model into general continuous distributions and deviation measures of risk. Using ideas from the Black–Litterman methodology, we design numerical methods (with variance reduction techniques) for the inverse portfolio optimization that extracts statistical information from historical data in a stable way. We introduce a quantitative model for stating investor's views and blending them consistently with the market information. The theory is complemented by efficient numerical methods with the implementation distributed in the form of publicly available R packages. We conduct practical tests, which demonstrate significant impact of the choice of distributions on optimal portfolio weights to the extent that the classical Black–Litterman procedure cannot be viewed as an adequate approximation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Asset allocation; Black–Litterman model; Deviation measures; Investment analysis; Numerical methods","Blending; Financial data processing; Inverse problems; Investments; Normal distribution; Risk assessment; Statistics; Asset allocation; Continuous distribution; Deviation measures; Efficient numerical method; Investment analysis; Portfolio optimization; Statistical information; Variance reduction techniques; Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053893336

This places particular importance on understanding the dynamics of knowledge as it flows, and organization managers seek to visualize and measure such flows for efficacy and efficiency alike. Unfortunately, knowledge is inherently intangible, invisible and resistant to quantification, particularly when in dynamic motion. Moreover, managing key organization knowledge is left often to haphazard, trial and error processes, rendering pursuits of sustainable competitive advantage daunting at best and infeasible in many cases. Even when guided by well-accepted models in extant theory, managers may not be selecting the best knowledge flow processes for their purposes. The research described in this article builds upon Knowledge Flow Theory and application to initiate a system for visualizing and measuring dynamic knowledge. We leverage a multidimensional model to delineate and analyze a diversity of knowledge as it flows through the organization, and we draw analogically to develop a system of dynamic knowledge equations that enable measurement. We then illustrate its practical use and utility through a representative organization example, which we supplement with decision guidance pertaining to some fundamental knowledge flow tradeoffs facing decision makers. This article closes with a summary of key results and implications, which give us cause to rethink some concepts, assumptions and implications in the literature. © 2018","Dynamics; Knowledge; Knowledge flow; Knowledge flow theory; Knowledge management; Measurement","Competition; Decision making; Dynamics; Managers; Measurement; Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Decision guidance; Knowledge; Knowledge flow; Knowledge-flow theory; Multi-dimensional model; Sustainable competitive advantages; Trial-and-error process; Knowledge management; knowledge; management; measurement method; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045470615

We empirically investigate the impact of the implementation of such joint ventures on both the respective airlines’ network structure and their productive efficiency. Using U.S. DOT T100 International Segment data and applying airline-market fixed effects models, we find that joint ventures – compared to services with a lower degree of cooperation – lead to a 3–5 percent increase in seat capacity between the respective partner airlines’ hub airports; however, this is done at the expense of services elsewhere in the network. Productive efficiency, as measured by load factors, is found to be 0.5–5 percent lower for joint venture routes compared to routes operated under antitrust immunity only.

Our results indicate that increasing population density increases agricultural productivity at the rural-urban fringe, while increasing urban fragmentation may have a detrimental effect on agricultural productivity at low levels of fragmentation.

They find that using ICT (mainly Internet) in commerce (e-commerce) is one of the most important levers of labor productivity among service firms. Service firms that are less ICT-intensive are less productive than more ICT-intensive firms; moreover, the use of mobile phones for services other than send-and-receive calls, highly improves the labor productivity of service firms. Conversely, using a website and computer network does not positively affect the labor productivity. Regarding geographical differences in labor productivity, the analysis shows that firms in Jerusalem are characterized by higher productivity than firms in the West Bank, while firms in Gaza have a lower productivity compared to firms in the West Bank.

To demonstrate this point, we equip the traditional economic order quantity (EOQ) setting with a rich set of demand models and compare social outcomes under two alternatives, dynamic and static pricing. We show that dynamic pricing generates higher retailer profits, a lower average price per unit sold, and higher sales volumes than static pricing. The mechanism behind the result is that with dynamic pricing the retailer ties the price of each unit to its holding costs, which allows him to increase the order quantity compared with static pricing and thus save on fixed ordering costs. Some of these cost savings are passed to consumers. Moreover, we demonstrate that this mechanism is robust to the presence of price-anticipating (strategic) consumer behavior. © 2019 INFORMS","Dynamic pricing; Inventory management; Welfare analysis","Consumer behavior; Inventory control; Sales; Dynamic pricing; Economic order quantity; Fixed ordering costs; Inventory holding; Inventory management; Operational efficiencies; Welfare analysis; Welfare implications; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072312432

We find systematic evidence of complementarity between performance pay and decentralization of decision making from principals to employees. However, adopting performance pay also leads to centralization of decision-making authority from nonmanagerial to managerial employees. The findings suggest that performance pay adoption leads to a concentration of decision-making control at the managerial employee level, as opposed to a general movement toward more decentralization throughout the organization. © 2019 INFORMS","Decentralization; Firm performance; Incentives; Management; Organizational design","Human resource management; Management; Managers; Productivity; Taxation; Decentralization; Firm Performance; Incentives; Organizational designs; Performance pays; Productivity gain; Regional variation; Representative sample; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075401052

Based on the well-established Inventory and Order Based Production Control Systems (the IOBPCS family), we develop a hybrid ATO system dynamics model and analytically study the impact of nonlinearities on its dynamic performance. Nonlinearities play an important, sometimes even a dominant, role in influencing the dynamic performance of supply chain systems. However, most IOBPCS based analytical studies assume supply chain systems are completely linear and thereby greatly limit the applicability of published results, making it difficult to fully explain and describe oscillations caused by internal factors. We address this gap by analytically exploring the non-negative order and capacity constraint nonlinearities present in an ATO system. By adopting nonlinear control engineering and simulation approaches, we reveal that, depending on the mean and amplitude of the demand, the non-negative order and capacity constraints in the ATO system may occur and their significant impact on system dynamics performance should be carefully considered. Failing to monitor non-negative order constraints may underestimate the mean level of inventory and overestimate the inventory recovery speed. Sub-assemblers may suffer increased inventory cost (i.e. the consequence of varying inventory levels and recovery speed) if capacity and non-negative order constraints are not considered at their production site. Future research should consider the optimal trade-off design between CODP inventory and capacity and the exploration of delivery lead-time dynamics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bullwhip; control engineering; nonlinearities; personal computer assemble-to-order systems; system dynamics; the IOBPCS family","Computer control systems; Control engineering; Economic and social effects; Inventory control; Personal computers; Production control; Supply chains; System theory; Assemble to order; bullwhip; Customer order decoupling point; Order based production; Ordering constraints; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; the IOBPCS family; Control nonlinearities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060614985

Despite the importance of these predictions, however, forecasters and market pundits face a difficult challenge when trying to forecast over the long-term. While statistical models can credibly rely on assumptions about the relationship between variables in the short-term, they are frequently less reliable in the long-term as political and technological transformations profoundly change how the economy works over time. Towards improving long-term predictions for energy commodities, this paper uses the elicitation and aggregation of experts' beliefs to put forward forecasts for crude oil and natural gas prices by incentivizing experts to tell the truth and minimising their own biases through the application of the Bayesian Truth Serum. With this approach, we generated both short-term and long-term forecasts, and used the short-term forecast to validate the quality of the experts' predictions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian Truth Serum; Crude oil prices; Expert elicitation; Natural gas prices; Surprisingly popular","Costs; Crude oil; Economics; Investments; Natural gas; Bayesian; Crude oil prices; Expert elicitation; Natural gas price; Surprisingly popular; Forecasting; Bayesian analysis; commodity price; crude oil; energy market; forecasting method; natural gas; price determination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071646287

In this way, we also deal with the unavailability of input prices which is common in the TFP literature. We apply the new techniques to U.S four-digit manufacturing data using a novel Bayesian nonparametric model based on local likelihood. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques organized around the method of Girolami and Calderhead (2011). We compare and contrast the estimates from the proposed new method with standard parametric methods such as the translog, the Generalized Leontief and the Normalized Quadratic and we also propose novel diagnostic tests for correct specification and validity of instruments. We show that parametric methods lead to biased estimation of TFP growth. Our empirical findings reveal that the new model passes successfully a battery of robustness checks including diagnostic testing and tests for weak identification as well as weak instruments. Finally policy implications relating to the nature of TFP growth are also provided. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian analysis; Estimation of TFP; Manufacturing; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Non parametric models","Instrument testing; Manufacture; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Productivity; Public policy; Bayesian Analysis; Bayesian nonparametric modeling; Generalized Leontief; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Non-parametric estimations; Non-parametric model; Nonparametric approaches; Total factor productivity; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063759975

The main obstacle in doing that originates from the highly diversified services and thus the customer base which offline businesses bring in. The heterogeneity of customers, geographic or demographic, needs to be accurately accounted for. However, although the previous transactions for each customer are well documented, his/her demographic data is difficult or costly to acquire. Traditional wisdom relies on fitting customers into some specific statistical distribution to arrive at a satisfactory stochastic model, which may be accurate, to some extent, at a higher level. This is the case for the classic Beta-Binomial/Negative Binomial Distribution (BB/NBD) model on customers' repeat purchasing in offline context. Nevertheless, to deal with the complex level in customers' heterogeneity at an O2O business, using specific distribution is inadequate, let alone the mathematical challenges. We propose a new model to deal with the diversity of customers. Using BB/NBD as a starting point, we relax the Beta assumption in the model to include a generalized distribution. The generalization is made possible through using the Gaussian quadrature. The results retain the elegance of stochastic model while at the same time it captures customers' heterogeneity at a better, granular level. We use a dataset from Ctrip.com, a leading O2O provider in China, to show that the proposed method outperforms the BB/NBD model in both in-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance. Our approach provides a practical solution for O2O practitioners to forecast their future demands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","BB/NBD; Business analytics; Count model; Online-to-Offline; Repeat purchase","Population statistics; Purchasing; Sales; Stochastic systems; Binomial distribution; Business analytics; Count models; Generalized distribution; Offline; Predictive performance; Repeat purchase; Statistical distribution; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035792852

Design/methodology/approach: An illustrative case study approach involving literature search and 72 interviews with built environment professionals, across five countries in four continents. Findings: Common difficulties arise in availability, reliability and interpretation of risk information, and in evaluating the impact of mitigation. These factors, coupled with the heterogeneous nature of commercial property, lack of transactional data and remote investors, make valuation of risk particularly challenging in the sector. Insurance incentives for risk mitigation are somewhat effective where employed and could be further developed, however, the influence of insurance is hampered by lack of insurance penetration and underinsurance. Research limitations/implications: Further investigation of the means to improve uptake of insurance and to develop insurance incentives for mitigation is recommended. Practical implications: Flood risk is inconsistently reflected in commercial property values leading to lack of mitigation and vulnerability of investments to future flooding. Improvements are needed in: access to adequate risk information; professional skills in valuing risk; guidance on valuation of flood risk; and regulation to ensure adequate consideration of risk and mitigation options. Originality/value: The research addresses a global issue that threatens local, and regional economies through loss of utility, business profitability and commercial property value.

However, the bulk of VSL research has focussed on estimating average values rather than taking account of the potential variation in VSL across groups. Policymakers are particularly concerned that using estimates based on data concerning adults might provide poor proxies of the values associated with preventing child fatalities. We investigate this empirical problem while also addressing methodological critiques of standard contingent valuation (CV) approaches to VSL estimation which ask survey respondents to value an outcome described in terms of both the probability of occurrence and the health impact of an event. A prior lab experiment confirms fundamental problems in subjects’ abilities to provide internally consistent valuations of such compound goods. Given this we compare CV approaches with the ‘chaining method’ of Carthy et al. (1999) which splits the valuation task in two, assessing the probability of an event and the disutility of that event separately and then ‘chaining’ responses together to obtain a VSL estimate. We provide a first application of this method to the estimation of the VSL for children and contrast this with values for adults. Results confirm prior expectations that VSL values for preventing child fatalities significantly exceed those for adults. Finally, we carry out the first replication of the chaining approach in a large and nationally representative sample of parents. We identify many advantages of chaining over CV approaches, however, through a novel variant of a validation test suggested by Carthy et al., we reveal anomalies in the estimates produced by the chaining method suggesting that a robust method for VSL calculation is yet to be refined. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chaining method; Contingent valuation; Health; Non-market valuation; Value of statistical life","Health; Chaining method; Contingent valuations; Non-market valuation; Potential variations; Probability of occurrence; Representative sample; Transportation planning; Value of statistical lives; Surveys; child mortality; comparative study; contingent valuation; health impact; health status; planning method; policy making; welfare economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065697685

Termed engineering project health management (EPHM), this paper presents a novel approach and framework for monitoring of engineering work through data-driven and computational analytics that in turn support the managerial interpretation and generation of higher level, context-specific understanding. EPHM is formed through the first adaptation of integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) to the field of engineering management; an approach that has been used to-date for the machine monitoring and predictive maintenance. The approach is applied to four industrial cases, which demonstrates the generation of project-specific information. The approach thereby acts to increase understanding of an engineering activity and a work state, and is complementary to existing managerial toolsets and approaches. A key tenet of the adaption of IVHM is to place the manager in a central role, supporting their professional judgment while reducing investigative effort. © 2018 IEEE.","Engineering management; integrated vehicle health management (IVHM); process monitoring and control; project management; project performance; project success factors","Decision making; Decision theory; Health; Job analysis; Maintainability; Managers; Monitoring; Open systems; Process monitoring; Project management; Complexity theory; Engineering management; Integrated vehicle health managements; Process monitoring and control; Project performance; Project success factors; Task analysis; Research and development management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049945238

Revenue shortfalls in states decreased intergovernmental transfers, which compounded the plight of local governments already facing large declines in own-source property taxes. Among the many casualties of this economic downturn were school districts, which responded by implementing a variety of financial management strategies to continue providing educational service provision to more than 50 million students across the United States. One strategy school districts continue to utilize is countercyclical stabilization of expenditures with fiscal slack, which raises an important—and, to date, largely unanswered—question of how school districts manage to accumulate fiscal slack, given both volatility and decreases in revenues in the years following the Great Recession. One approach is to use implicit slack from biased forecasts to generate explicit fiscal slack in the unassigned fund balance. This article provides evidence for this strategy by empirically testing it with data from Kentucky school districts from school years 2001-2002 to 2013-2014. The findings indicate that school districts are engaged in strategic planning with implicit fiscal slack, which allows them to accumulate explicit fiscal slack, a cornerstone of prudent financial management that can provide budgetary flexibility during financial uncertainty. The relationship between implicit and explicit fiscal slack is heterogeneous over the business cycle, providing further evidence of strategic planning. Practitioners can also use the findings of this article to support the strategic use of forecasts to help accumulate unassigned fund balance, particularly in the years after the Great Recession. © The Author(s) 2018.","budgeting; financial management; forecasting; strategic planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059287071

Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from across the value chain including product designers, manufacturers, users and waste managers as well policy makers and academics. The interviews sought to examine perceived and real barriers to reuse in the UK. Three inter-connected factors that limit opportunities and instances of reuse of electrical and electronic equipment were identified, highlighting that both systemic and consumer barriers to increasing levels of reuse exist. These are: producer reluctance, unsuitable collection infrastructure and cultural issues. Overall, the paper shows that low levels of reuse in the electrical and electronic sector are a result of complex and interlinked barriers. Understanding these connections offers the potential to improve the opportunities for reuse, by providing direction for policy makers to address barriers from a multi stakeholder perspective. Increasing instances of reuse is essential if the UK is to successfully move towards a resource efficient, circular economy. © 2019 The Authors","Barriers; Circular economy; Electrical and electronic equipment (EEE); Resource efficiency; Reuse","Decision making; Electronic assessment; Barriers; Circular economy; Electrical and electronic equipment; Resource efficiencies; Reuse; Electronic equipment; article; consumer; economic aspect; human; manager; semi structured interview",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075408643

Among these approaches, non-overlapping temporal aggregation has been shown to be an effective approach that can improve forecast accuracy. However, the benefit of this approach has been shown only under single exponential smoothing (when it is a non-optimal method) and no theoretical analysis has been conducted to look at the impact of this approach under optimal forecasting. This paper aims to bridge this gap by analysing the impact of temporal aggregation on supply chain demand and orders when optimal forecasting is used. To do so, we consider a two-stage supply chain (e.g. a retailer and a manufacturer) where the retailer faces an autoregressive moving average demand process of order (1,1) -ARMA(1,1)- that is forecasted by using the optimal Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) forecasting method. We derive the analytical expressions of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) at the retailer and the manufacturer levels as well as the bullwhip ratio when the aggregation approach is used. We numerically show that, although the aggregation approach leads to an accuracy loss at the retailer's level, it may result in a reduction of the MSE at the manufacturer level up to 90% and a reduction of the bullwhip effect in the supply chain that can reach up to 84% for high lead-times. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bullwhip effect; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting; MMSE forecasting method; Temporal aggregation","Manufacture; Mean square error; Sales; Supply chains; Analytical expressions; Autoregressive moving average; Bullwhip effects; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting methods; Minimum mean squared error; Temporal aggregation; Two-stage supply chains; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054825199

The customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis (FCFS) regardless of their class. Such systems are common in customer call centers, which often segment their arrivals into classes of callers whose requests differ in their complexity and criticality. We first consider an M/G/1 + M queue and then analyze the M/M/k + M case. Analyzing these systems using a queue length process proves intractable as it would require us to keep track of the class of each customer at each position in the queue. Consequently, we introduce a virtual waiting time process where the service times of customers who will eventually abandon the system are not considered. We analyze this process to obtain performance measures such as the percentage of customers receiving service in each class, the expected waiting times of customers in each class, and the average number of customers waiting in queue. We use our characterization to perform a numerical analysis of the M/M/k + M system and find several managerial implications of administering a FCFS system with multiple classes of impatient customers. Finally, we compare the performance a system based on data from a call center with the steady-state performance measures of a comparable M/M/k + M system.

Their inventory policies are crucial to automobile supply chain management, yet they are largely unexplored empirically. Using data from General Motors dealerships, this paper proposes two simultaneous equation modeling (SEM) systems to examine the interactive and simultaneous effects of sales demand, order quantity and inventory level in dealerships. Our empirical results indicate that high demand leads to high inventory levels (sales effect), while high inventory levels stimulate sales demand (demand stimulation effect) in a dynamic and uncertain environment. We also find that inventory cannot stimulate demand infinitely. This study is among the first empirical investigations to experiment with a SEM system applied to finished-goods inventory management in the automobile supply chain. Together, our methodology and results provide several avenues for developing finished-goods inventory policies in business management. © 2018","Automobile dealership industry; Demand stimulation; Finished-goods inventory management; Simultaneous equation econometric systems","Automobiles; Automotive industry; Inventory control; Sales; Business management; Demand stimulation; Empirical investigation; Inventory management; Simultaneous effects; Simultaneous equation modeling; Simultaneous equations; Uncertain environments; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057613272

To provide insight into this issue, this study examines leadership behavior in an IC developing a strategic plan to promote changes to address public health and safety concerns related to substance abuse. Combining observations and interviews, we followed a statewide interagency taskforce in a southwestern state of the United States from its inception through completion of its strategic plan within a 10-month deadline. Findings show different leadership behaviors were integrated and evolved over time to strike a balance between decision-making effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, the findings support recent research on examining leadership behavior holistically to develop a ‘fuller full-range’ leadership perspective (Antonakis and House, 2014), especially in terms of how collectivistic and instrumental leadership should complement transformational leadership, and by demonstrating that the combinations of leadership change over time and occur at multiple levels.

First, the visibility of a product as a recommendation on other products’ pages may increase its exposure and result in a greater number of its page views. Second, visibility of substitute products on the product’s page may cannibalize its own sales while resulting in greater exposure for the substitute products. The net impact of these opposing effects is unclear. We conduct a randomized experiment on a fashion apparel retailer’s website to answer the following questions: (1) what is the causal value of recommendation links from a product to its recommended products in terms of the additional sales for both the product and its recommended products, and (2) how does the value of a product’s recommendation links vary based on its network characteristics, such as its PageRank and the strength of its relationship with neighboring products? We find that as a result of a recommendation, on average, (1) the daily number of product page views increased by 7.5%, and (2) conditional on a product’s page view, its sales decreased by 1.9%, and the sales of its recommended substitutes increased by 9%. On average, recommendation links of a product result in an 11% gain in total sales of the product and its recommended substitutes. However, these gains are not evenly distributed among all products. We find that although the number of page views for a product is positively affected by the number and strength of its incoming links, its sales (its recommended products’ sales) conditional on its page view are negatively (positively) affected by the strength of its outgoing links. We conduct policy simulations to highlight how retailers and producers can apply this knowledge by engineering the recommendation network through sponsored links. © 2019 INFORMS","Average treatment effect; Digital advertising; Electronic commerce; Product recommendation network; Product recommendations; Randomized field experiment; Sponsored product advertising","Electronic commerce; Visibility; Websites; Average treatment effects; E-commerce websites; Field experiment; Network characteristics; Policy simulation; Product recommendation; Randomized experiments; Substitute products; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079294604

We assume that the price is set only once after collecting data, possibly from history or a market study, and that the price–demand relationship is a decreasing convex or concave function. Different from the classic approach that fits a function to the price–demand data, we propose and study a maximin framework introducing a novel concept of function robustness. This function robustness concept also provides an alternative mechanism for performing sensitivity analysis for decisions in the presence of data fitting errors. The overall profit maximization model is a nonconvex optimization problem in a function space. A two-sided cutting surface algorithm is developed to solve the maximin model. An analytical approach to compute the rate of decrease of optimal profit is also given for the purposes of sensitivity analysis. Experiments show that the proposed function robust model provides a framework for risk–reward tradeoff in decision making.

As a result, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to developing time series analysis methods to predict future values based on previously observed values. One of the well-known methods is the Holt-Winters’ seasonal method, which is commonly used to capture the seasonality effect in time series data. In this study, the authors aim to build upon the Holt-Winters’ additive method by introducing new formulas for finding the initial values. Obtaining more accurate estimations of the initial values could result in a better forecasting result. The authors use the basic principle found in the weighted moving average method to assign more weight to the most recent data and combine it with the original initial conditions found in the Holt-Winters’ additive method. Based on the experiment performed, the authors conclude that the new formulas for finding the initial values in the Holt-Winters’ additive method could give a better forecasting when compared to the traditional Holt-Winters’ additive method and the weighted moving average method in terms of the accuracy level.

In organizing a project’s tasks into work packages, trade-offs arise. Defining small work packages increases project complexity and workload, and reduces economies of scale, whereas defining large work packages reduces concurrent processing and adversely affects cash flow. Our work is apparently the first to study this trade-off. We consider the objective of minimizing total project cost, subject to a deadline on project makespan. For serial task networks, we describe an efficient algorithm that finds optimal work package sizes. For acyclic task networks, we develop a heuristic method and a lower bound for the unary NP-hard problem. A computational study shows that our heuristic routinely delivers near-optimal solutions that substantially improve on those found by benchmark procedures. Our results demonstrate the value of deliberately varying work package sizes within a project, in contrast to typical project management practice. Related issues including multiple serial paths in parallel, task incompatibility, and generalized precedence constrained work packages are also discussed. Our work enables more precise planning of work packages to improve performance, documents the value of integrating the planning of work packages and schedules, and provides insights that guide resource allocation decisions. © 2019 INFORMS.","Project management; Project performance; Work breakdown structure; Work package sizing","Codes (symbols); Computational complexity; Economic and social effects; Economics; Optimization; Project management; Computational studies; Concurrent processing; Near-optimal solutions; Project management practices; Project performance; Resource allocation decision; Work breakdown structure; Work packages; Heuristic methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062088732

Data were collected in the form of semi-structured interviews with management at various provider firms. The interview guide was based on theoretical constructs regarding tangible and intangible capabilities (RBV) as well as constructs related to governance and integration (TCE). Unlike customer focused studies, this study is able to identify what distinguishes the rare successful boundary crossing attempts that lead to a more profitable market position. The key finding which contradicts studies based on the customer/outsourcing actor perspective is that a switch from a highly commoditised market position to a higher margin position is only possible, if relationships and network capabilities are leveraged, regardless of the assets and physical resources available to the firm. The presentation of service boundaries as both dynamic and fluid and the use of RBV are contributions, building on existing theory, illustrating why providers of commoditised services cannot escape from low-margin, competitive market positions simply by acquiring tangible assets. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","competitive markets; logistics; resource-based view; service boundaries; service providers; transaction cost economics","Commerce; Information management; Logistics; Outsourcing; Sales; Competitive markets; Logistics industry; Logistics services; Resource-based view; Semi structured interviews; Service provider; Third party logistics; Transaction cost economics; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055579792

This paper develops a dynamic pricing model for products with significant item-specific demand uncertainty, in which a forward-looking seller learns about the item-specific demand through an initial assessment, as well as during the selling process. The model demonstrates how seller learning, through several mechanisms, can lead to the commonly observed downward trend in the prices of individual items. These mechanisms include the seller's optimal adjustment of prices over time to account for the dynamic adverse selection of unsold items and the diminishing option value in future learning. The model is estimated using novel panel data of a leading used-car dealership. Counterfactual experiments show that the value of learning in the selling process is $203 per car. Conditional on subsequent learning in the selling process, the initial assessment further improves profit per car by $139. With the dealer's net profit per car being about $1,150, these estimates suggest a potentially high return to taking an information-based approach toward pricing products with item-specific demand uncertainty. © 2019 INFORMS","Demand uncertainty; Dynamic pricing; Item-specific demand; Supply-side learning","Automobiles; Costs; Profitability; Risk management; Sales; Uncertainty analysis; Counterfactual experiments; Demand uncertainty; Dynamic pricing; Dynamic pricing models; Initial assessment; Item-specific demand; Modeling of dynamics; Supply sides; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076438116

Design/methodology/approach: A social constructionist epistemology supports the discourse analysis of talk (semi-structured interview and conversational), text (SMS and documentation) and visual (safety related signage) data collection from five large (+£20 m) UK construction sites. Findings: Construction workers readily understand safety to be an emergent phenomenon with the complex system that is the construction site. Contemporary safety management approaches struggle with this complexity, yet there is the potential to mobilise situational self-organising on sites to improve safety in practice. Research limitations/implications: Epistemological foundations mean no claim is made to generalisability as perceived by traditional positivistic parameters. The data are limited to large (+£20 m) UK construction sites; however, underlying construction management systems are common to the industry as a whole and can find fit with practitioner experiences and other empirical academic work from both the UK and other countries. Practical implications: Situational self-organising of safety management within the construction workforce is proposed as a key contribution to a relevant, dynamic and effective SMS. Originality/value: Data are analysed from a social constructionist perspective and considered through a complexity lens. This approach unpacks these data in an original way to seek synergy with existing adaptive safety approaches, specifically situational self-organising and make recommendations for practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Construction safety; Construction site; Management; Safety; Situational self-organising; Social constructionism","Accident prevention; Human resource management; Information management; Management; Project management; Complexity; Construction safety; Construction sites; Self-organising; Social constructionism; Occupational risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067034918

The sustainability of the service sector is linked to KS practices and creativity. Therefore, to survive in a dynamic business environment, universities have to formulate and implement such practices and innovative learning systems. This paper aims to highlight how social media networking apps can be used efficiently and effectively to support the antecedents of KS among the employees in public and private universities. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a positivistic approach and a quantitative research design. A survey was carried out with employees at public and private universities. The respondents were chosen based on simple random sampling with the purpose of increasing the validity and generalizability of the results in the context of university settings and for other sectors as well. Findings: Certain individual and organizational factors have been found, which have been supported by social networking tools. These factors can enhance KS practices, such as informal relationships and social networking, effective communication and collaboration, mutual trust and the intention to share knowledge, the KS culture and new ideas. The results of this study reveal that social networking applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Facebook, Research-gate, YouTube and personal blogs are more productive in supporting the antecedents of KS stated above in university settings. Research limitations/implications: Social networking applications have received attention because executives and researchers are increasingly focusing on finding new ways to use social networking tools for business purposes. The effective and efficient use of social networking tools helps organizations to foster knowledge amongst employees to address various critical issues, such as knowledge hoarding, lower levels of skills and knowledge, lower levels of communication and employee involvement, a lack of the intention to share knowledge and resistance toward the adoption of new technology. Originality/value: There is rare literature available on how social networking tools can support the antecedents of KS in university settings. Most of such literature has investigated the link between social media and KS using a systematic literature and qualitative research approach. This research is based on empirical study and it is unique as it investigates the hitherto under-researched issue of the adoption of social networking applications to foster the antecedents of KS in university settings. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Knowledge sharing; KS practices; Public and private sector universities; Quantitative approach; Social networking (SN) applications","Knowledge management; Learning systems; Personnel; Service industry; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Sustainable development; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic business environment; Effective communication; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational factors; Public and private sector; Quantitative approach; Social networking applications; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073670985

The authors drawing on regulatory focus theory and self-regulatory for this propose. Design/methodology/approach: Salespeople involved in the study represent different firms selling a wide variety of food and household products to a wholesaler, which resells them to supermarket chains. The authors collected data from 231 industrial salespeople. Findings: First, salesperson assessment focus amplified locomotion’s effect on acquisition–retention ambidexterity. Second, salespeople increased their performance by implementing an acquisition–retention ambidextrous orientation that balances prospecting for new customers and growing existing customers. Third, findings revealed a mediating effect of ambidextrous orientation on the relationship between regulatory mode and sales performance. Finally, outcomes supported the conditional moderated-mediated effect of regulatory mode in explaining performance through ambidextrous orientation. Practical implications: Results suggest that salespeople need to equalize their dual orientations in a complementary way to elaborate their selling strategies according to each customer. For example, in an unbalanced orientation, putting high levels of assessment into a sales encounter can reduce the effective and efficient use of time in interacting with customers. Originality/value: The authors further illustrate the importance of using both locomotion and assessment in attaining sales goals (Pierro et al. 2013). This synergistic effect is known as the complementary hypothesis (Pierro et al., 2006a, 2006b). Each dimension complements the other and has a moderated-mediated effect on performance through acquisition–retention ambidexterity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acquisition; Ambidexterity; Assessment; Locomotion; Retention; Sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071671551

Yet, the literature provides little guidance because research to date has offered contradictory theoretical predictions and inconsistent empirical findings. Drawing on the theory of strategic purity and information processing theory, we explain why service specialization is likely to increase carriers' technical efficiency and why size will have a more pronounced effect on technical efficiency for carriers specializing in LTL services versus TL services. To test our theory, we assemble a panel data set from archival government sources regarding general freight motor carriers' provision of LTL and TL services. We measure carriers' technical efficiency using data envelopment analysis and test our hypotheses by fitting a series of panel data mixed-effects models. Our results indicate that carriers are most technically efficient when they specialize in one service type. We also find that size positively affects technical efficiency but only for carriers specializing in LTL services; no returns to scale with regard to technical efficiency exist for carriers specializing in TL services. © 2019 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals","data envelopment analysis; efficiency; motor carrier; panel data; productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062708070

In particular, we examine how a major U.S. airline's price dispersion in the coach cabin changes after introducing the option to upgrade to a new type of premium economy seating within the coach cabin. We first provide a theoretical analysis that highlights two competing pressures that the new premium economy seating upgrades created on coach class prices. On the one hand, the airline benefits from lowering its prices because by allowing more customers to purchase in the first place, it increases the probability of selling upgrades (admission effect). On the other hand, for some customers, the value of flying with the airline increases because of the upgrade availability, therefore the airline may find it optimal to increase its prices (valuation effect). In the second part of the paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of upgrade introduction on coach class prices, based on a proprietary transaction-level data set from a major U.S. airline company. The empirical analysis tests the main predictions of our theoretical model and examines further nuances. The results show that the introduction of the premium economy seating upgrades is associated with an increase in the price dispersion and revenues in the coach class, the admission effect is stronger than the valuation effect on the low end of the price distribution, and the opposite is true on the high end of the price distribution. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for firm revenues and consumer welfare. © 2018 INFORMS.","Airline industry; Causal inference; Difference-in-differences; Price discrimination; Price dispersion; Quasi-experiment; Upgrades","Costs; Dispersions; Economics; Sales; Airline industry; Causal inferences; Difference-in-differences; Price discrimination; Price dispersion; Quasi-experiments; Upgrades; Air transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071149271

The study empirically examines how an extended political risk definition, operationalised into a model consisting of 12 political risk variables, helps predict location decisions across offshoring entry modes and activity types. The research focuses on captive offshoring and offshore outsourcing entry modes, and Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO), Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) activity types. The research indicated that political risk factors accounted for 38% of the variability in offshore outsourcing flows, implying that concerns about service disruptions and/or cost implications of external uncertainties feature as a key factor in supplier selection and location decisions. The findings further confirm a positive relationship between institutional and regulatory factors in host locations, and the flow of offshoring activities with a high knowledge content. The research contributes to enhancing the explanatory ability of Transaction Cost Economics by re-operationalising the concept of political risk in the context of both offshore outsourcing and captive offshoring.

The model posits that a risk response decision is indirectly influenced by perceived risk exposure via overall risk response attitude. The model conceptualizes perceived risk exposure and overall risk response attitude as second-order constructs and examines the dimension-level relationships within each. The model hypothesizes that a risk response decision is also influenced by pressures ITPMs perceive for or against enacting a specific risk response, by a negative synergy effect between overall risk response attitude and perceived pressures, and by their perception of control—or lack thereof—over enacting the risk response. The model was instantiated for three specific risk responses: having user representatives as team members, appreciating team members’ work in a tangible way during the project, and dedicating much effort to planning. Each model instance was tested in a separate survey (N > 111 per survey, total N = 349). The results support the hypotheses, except for the influence of perceived control, which varied across instantiations of risk responses. Among other antecedents, overall risk response attitude is found to have the strongest effect on risk response decisions. The findings stress the effect of ITPMs’ salient beliefs about specific risk responses on their decision to enact a given response and thus pave the way for designing behavior change interventions. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

Public transport traveller surveys were conducted to better understand the journey stages at which information was sought and the information sources used. A multivariate explanatory model of pre-travel information-seeking behaviour was developed using binomial logistic regression. Explanatory factors considered include socio-demographics, trip context, frequency of public transport use, information sources used, and smartphone ownership and use. Findings suggest that travel behaviour (5 + trips weekly, and < 1 trip weekly), socio-demographics (unemployment/unknown employment), trip context (journey planning stages, mode of transport), and preferred information sources (Internet site, word-of-mouth, visits to travel shop/centre/library) were significant predictors of pre-travel information-seeking behaviours among surveyed travellers. While the final model found that bus users are significantly associated with the use of Internet sites as a source of pre-travel information, rail users rely significantly on a multiplicity of sources comprising Internet sites, word-of-mouth, and visits to a travel shop/centre/library. The final model suggests that metro (light rail) users tend not to seek pre-travel information. The odds of seeking pre-travel public transport information are 2.512 times greater for respondents who reported < 1 trip per week as opposed to those who reported 5 + trips per week.

In particular, this is much more severe in an empirical study of itemized bids in highway procurement auctions. To overcome this obstacle, this article employs the regularized linear regression for the estimation of a more precise interval for project winning bids. The approach is put to the test using empirical data of highway procurement auctions in Vermont. In our empirical analysis, we first choose a set of crucial tasks that determine a bidder’s bid amounts by using the random forest variable selection method. Given the selected tasks, project bid forecasting is conducted. We compare our proposed methodology with the least square linear model based on the bias and the standard root mean square error of the bid estimates. There is evidence supporting that the suggested approach provides superior forecasts for an interval of winning bids over the competing model. As far as we know, this article is the first attempt to provide reference bids of highway construction contracts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Auctions; bidding; forecasting; regularized linear regression","auction; empirical analysis; machine learning; prediction; regression analysis; road construction; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055752451

These pioneers use different recruiting strategies than plants elsewhere: they hire more workers from outside their industry and from outside their region, especially when workers come from closely related industries or are highly skilled. The importance of access to experienced workers is highlighted in the diffusion of industries from western Germany to the post-reunification economy of eastern German. While manufacturing employment declined in most advanced economies, eastern German regions managed to reindustrialise. The pioneers involved in this process relied heavily on expertise from western Germany: while establishing new manufacturing industries in the East, they sourced half of their experienced workers from the West. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Clusters; Diversification; Germany; Industry-specific human capital; Local labour markets; Mobility; Technological diffusion","Carrier mobility; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Employment; Manufacture; Personnel; Clusters; Diversification; Germany; Labour market; Specific human capitals; Diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056905779

On these forecast horizons there is increased uncertainty that the analysts face. To this purpose, we incorporate macroeconomic variables into microeconomic demand forecasting. Forecast accuracy metrics, which are typically used to assess improvements in predictions, are proxies of the real decision associated costs. However, measuring the direct impact on decisions is preferable. In this paper, we examine the capacity planning decision at plant level of a manufacturer. Through an inventory simulation setup, we evaluate the gains of incorporating external macroeconomic information in the forecasts, directly, in terms of achieving target service levels and inventory performance. Furthermore, we provide an approach to indicate capacity alerts, which can serve as input for global capacity pooling decisions. Our work has two main contributions. First, we demonstrate the added value of leading indicator information in forecasting models, when evaluated directly on capacity planning. Second, we provide additional evidence that traditional metrics of forecast accuracy exhibit weak connection with the real decision costs, in particular for capacity planning. We propose a more realistic assessment of the forecast quality by evaluating both the first and second moment of the forecast distribution. We discuss implications for practice, in particular given the typical over-reliance on forecast accuracy metrics for choosing the appropriate forecasting model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity planning; Forecasting; Inventory; Leading indicators","Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Capacity planning; Forecast distribution; Forecasting modeling; Inventory; Inventory performance; Leading indicators; Macroeconomic variables; Tactical capacity planning; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049326644

Under a simple yet rigorous fixed effects model with geographic clustering, we study the relationship between environmentally-certified retail space and location-specific financial performance.

These results are tested in an event study which validates the findings, and indicates that the benefits of LEED extend years past initial certification, evidencing lasting income-related benefits. Finally, bank- and branch-specific subsample analyses confirm these results while controlling for idiosyncratic characteristics. © 2018","Bank branches; Deposits; Energy efficiency; Real estate; Retail; Sustainability","Deposits; Energy efficiency; Sales; Sustainable development; Bank branches; Financial impacts; Financial performance; Fixed effects models; Geographic clustering; Real estate; Retail; Retail revenue; Environmental design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058030329

In practical conditions, it suffers from four challenges: (1) inputs are gathered from heterogeneous sources, which could also result in heterogeneous formats and types, (2) historic records are insufficient owing to limited number of suspect objects and under-developed detection technologies and devices, (3) missing information resulted from inadequacy of input gathering, exchanging, and storage, and (4) the assessment process should be accessible to experts and decision makers to provide reasonability. In this study, the belief rule base (BRB) under a disjunctive assumption (disjunctive BRB) is applied because it can handle heterogeneous and insufficient information as well as provide access to experts and decision makers. Furthermore, a new disjunctive BRB spreading approach with six steps is proposed to specifically handle the missing information challenge. First, multiple sub-BRBs are initialized and then optimized using heterogeneous and insufficient information. Sub-BRBs are in different belief structures, which are part of the complete belief structure. Second, a self-organizing map (SOM)-based procedure is proposed to integrate multiple sub-BRBs into one final BRB (f-BRB) in the complete belief structure with consideration of the weights of sub-BRBs. A practical threat level assessment case is studied to validate the efficiency of the proposed disjunctive BRB spreading approach. The case study results show that (1) optimization can help improve the modeling accuracy of sub-BRBs to different degrees while initial sub-BRBs have shown varied performances, and (2) f-BRB produces the highest modeling accuracy on both historic records and newly detected suspect objects. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Disjunctive belief rule base; Heterogeneous; Insufficient; Missing information; Spreading; Threat level assessment","Conformal mapping; Decision making; Self organizing maps; Belief rule base; Heterogeneous; Insufficient; Missing information; Spreading; Threat levels; Object detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054743151

By enabling individuals to display emotions broadly, social media amplify sentiments defined as shared collective emotion to supply the forces that drive change in society. This study describes how one platform, Facebook, contributed to these two different examples of political activism. Using social network analytics and text mining, we examine how Fan Page posts during the life of the movements influenced the formation of social ties by using sentimental messaging. We hypothesize a set of relationships between group cohesion and polarity of sentiments in explaining involvement. We find that the strength of social ties formed through exchanges of posts and comments influence participation, but its effect differs across two movements. We also find that negative sentiments are associated with more participation for Egypt during the AS than OWS. Our results suggest cultural differences play a major role in participation behaviors. Social media is important in engineering management, because someone who has a negative reaction to a project or a product can use these media to reach thousands of individuals and potentially turn sentiment against a project. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Group cohesion; online activism; social media; social movement; text mining","Adhesion; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Fans; Industry; Springs (components); Text messaging; Cultural difference; Facebook; Group cohesions; online activism; Social media; Social movements; Text mining; Twitter; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044789591

This pattern shows a degradation trend with multiple jump points, which are mixed effects of two failure modes: a soft mode of continuous smooth degradation and a hard mode of abrupt failure. Both modes need to be modeled jointly to predict the system residual life. In this paper, an autoregressive moving average model-filtered hidden Markov model is proposed to fit the multi-phase degradation data with unknown number of jump points, together with an iterative algorithm for parameter estimation. The comprehensive algorithm is composed of non-linear least-square method, recursive extended least-square method, and expectation–maximization algorithm to handle different parts of the model. The proposed methodology is applied to a specific PV module system with simulated performance measurements for its reliability evaluation and residual life prediction. Comprehensive studies have been conducted, and analysis results show better performance over competing models and more importantly all the jump points in the simulated data have been identified. Also, this algorithm converges fast with satisfactory parameter estimates accuracy, regardless of the jump point number. © 2017, © 2017 International Chinese Association of Quantitative Management.","hidden Markov model; multi-phase degradation; residual life prediction; System reliability","Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Iterative methods; Least squares approximations; Outages; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability; Solar cell arrays; Solar power generation; Auto-regressive moving average model; Maximization algorithm; Non-linear least squares; Recursive extended least squares; Reliability Evaluation; Residual life prediction; Spacecraft solar arrays; System reliability; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020659296

In this article, we (1) theoretically extend Fogg’s ideas by identifying contexts in which virtual teams are more likely to use persuasive technologies; (2) empirically measure technology visualness, a factor that likely makes technologies more or less persuasive; and (3) assess the association between the use of persuasive technologies, judgment shifts, and forecast performance in a real-world virtual team context. We identify visual representation technologies (VRTs) as a class of technologies used by virtual teams to select, transform, and present data in a rich visual format. We propose that such technologies play a persuasive, as well as diagnostic, role in virtual team decisions. Over a three-year period, we examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team that makes smog forecasts with large economic and health consequences. We supplement regression models of field data with an experiment, interviews with team members, and analyses of imagery processing and group cohesion in team language use. Experiment results show that, relative to non-VRTs, the use of a VRT in a forecasting task increases imagery processing. Field data results show that team members increase their use of VRTs during chat room discussions when initial team consensus is low and the environment is more exacting. Greater use of VRTs in team discussions relates to greater shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater odds of the team shifting its forecast policy to issue a smog alert. Increased use of VRTs is associated with lower forecast bias but is not significantly associated with forecast accuracy. VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion, as shown through language use.

We focus on the assortment optimization problem under this choice model. In this problem, the retailer wants to find the revenue-maximizing set of products to offer when the buying process of each customer is governed by the k-product nonparametric choice model. First, we show that the assortment problem is strongly NP-hard even for k = 2.Motivated by this result,we develop a linear programming-based randomized rounding algorithm that gives the best known approximation guarantee.

Traditionally, DEA is applied for estimating the performance of a set of DMUs through measuring a single perspective of efficiency. However, in recent years, due to increasing competition in various industries, modern enterprises focus on enhancing their performance by measuring efficiencies in different aspects, separately or simultaneously. This paper proposes a bi-level multi-objective DEA (BLMO DEA) model which is able to assess the performance of DMUs in two different hierarchical dimensions, simultaneously. In the proposed model, we define two level efficiency scores for each DMU. The aim is to maximize these two efficiencies, simultaneously, for each DMU. Since the objective functions at both levels are fractional, a fuzzy fractional goal programming (FGP) methodology is used to solve the proposed BLMO DEA model. The capability of the proposed model is illustrated by a numerical example. Finally, to practically validate the proposed model, a real case study from 45 bank's branches is applied. The results show that the proposed model can provide a more comprehensive measure for efficiency of each bank's branch based on simultaneous measuring of two different efficiencies, profit and operational efficiencies, and by considering the level of their importance. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2019","Bank efficiency; Bi-level programming; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Fuzzy programming","Competition; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Linear programming; Profitability; Bi-level programming; Data envelopment analysis models; Decision making unit; Fuzzy programming; Goal programming; Level efficiencies; Objective functions; Operational efficiencies; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070360117

To do so, we build a hidden Markov model and estimate it with individual-level transaction data collected from a premier online retailer. Our quantification of transits across consumer-retailer relationship states provides unique insights. For example, price promotion can strengthen consumers' loyalty only for consumers who are at least moderately loyal whereas it is not effective at changing nonloyal consumers' attitudes toward an online retailer (i.e., from nonloyal to loyal). Unlike in the off-line market, consumers even in the strong relationship state are likely to seek more coupons as they increase their online shopping experience. The switching behavior observed even after online consumers reach the strong relationship state shows one aspect of the fierce price competition in the online market. Our results also suggest that managers of online retailers pay attention to the recent change in a consumer's buying behaviors rather than the long-term trend of the consumer's purchase behavior. For instance, an increase in recent purchase volume strengthens loyalty toward the retailer and/or the habit of buying without a coupon for consumers in the strong relationship state. These findings have important managerial and operational implications for devising a customized marketing mix strategy. © 2019, INFORMS.","Coupon utilizations; Hidden Markov model (hmm); Online buying behavior; Price promotion","Competition; Electronic commerce; Hidden Markov models; Managers; Sales; Coupon utilizations; Individual levels; Online buying; Online consumers; Price competition; Price promotions; Switching behaviors; Transaction data; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065431722

We further estimated the efficiency effects of the relative market power/size, ownership structure, and origin of capital. The global crisis had detrimental effects since the overall efficiency score dropped by about 3%. On the contrary, Croatian banks have largely benefited from the EU membership, and the efficiency score after the EU association increased by about 45%. The market leaders are more efficient than the competitive fringe, which is in line with the efficiency structure hypothesis. In addition, the biggest banks are the most efficient ones, meaning that the scale efficiency hypothesis has also been upheld.

However, there have been inadequate efforts addressing the basic question of how to design and execute PES at the program level. By comparing and contrasting the experiences of restoring degraded cropland to forest and grass covers in China and the U.S., this paper aims to tackle that question and provide some valuable and timely policy insights that can inform China and other countries of how to improve the performance of their PES programs in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and/or equity. Our analysis will unfold through examining such specific question as: What are the socioeconomic and environmental backgrounds for one country to launch a large PES program? How was it designed initially and has evolved over time? How has its performance been evaluated and what are the main outcomes? How likely is it for the enrolled land to be reconverted or for the contract to be expired? What are the primary challenges to its long-term success? Finally, this study calls for a more practical and focused approach to PES design, implementation, and evaluation that will lead to improved outcomes of forest and grassland ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation reserve; Ecological restoration; Forest cover; Payments for ecosystem services; Policy design and implementation; Program effectiveness and efficiency","Biodiversity; Conservation; Efficiency; Environmental protection; Forestry; Restoration; Ecological restoration; Forest cover; Payments for ecosystem services; Policy design; Program effectiveness; Ecosystems; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Forestry; Restoration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047514999

Relaxing credit constraints can increase the productivity of farmers. Using a field experiment involving in Bangladesh, we estimated the impact of access to credit on the overall productivity of rice farmers, and disentangled the total effect into technological change (frontier shift) and technical efficiency changes. We found that relative to the baseline rice output per decimal, access to credit resulted in, on average, approximately a 14 percent increase in yield, holding all other inputs constant. After decomposing the total effect into the frontier shift and efficiency improvement, we found that, on average, around 11 percent of the increase in output came from changes in technology, or frontier shift, while the remaining 3 percent was attributed to improvements in technical efficiency. The efficiency gain was higher for modern hybrid rice varieties, and almost zero for traditional rice varieties. Within the treatment group, the effect was greater among pure tenant and mixed-tenant farm households compared with farmers that only cultivated their own land. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Credit; Efficiency; Farmers; Field experiment; Microfinance; Productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074503469

We propose that customers who have previously interacted with diverse types of organizations in the market convey informationally rich feedback that better enables organizations to understand and adapt to change—particularly in more rapidly changing contexts. We further expect that organizations that position themselves congruently with market preferences will be stronger market competitors. We test and find support for our arguments using a unique dataset of over 8,000 cannabis dispensaries operating in seven states that were listed on Weedmaps.com between July 2014 and June 2016. Managerial Summary : Performance of organizations in changing markets depends on their ability to adapt to evolving customer preferences. Such adaptation requires understanding how preferences evolve—not only among existing customers, but also in the broader market in which the organization competes. We propose that feedback from customers who have previously interacted with diverse types of organizations in the market enables organizations to understand customer expectations and adapt to changing demand landscapes by positioning themselves accordingly. We find support for these arguments in legalized cannabis markets within seven U.S. states. Dispensaries that get more feedback from experientially diverse customers position themselves in ways that are more congruent with the preferences of customers in their market. Furthermore, dispensaries who are more congruent with market preferences survive longer, bring in a greater number of new consumers, and are generally more appealing to those consumers. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","obsolescence; organizational adaptation; organizational ecology; organizational identity; sociology of markets","Obsolescence; Sales; Statistical tests; Customer expectation; Customer preferences; Demand-side; Organizational adaptation; Organizational ecology; Organizational identities; Organizational theory; Stronger markets; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070985178

As a consequence, the relationship between buyer and supplier is important for the success of the project. In this paper we investigate the claim that auctions in procurement can be detrimental for the buyer–supplier relationship, which is in line with the observation that reverse auctions are less frequently conducted if projects are complex. A poor relationship can result in a decrease in trust on the part of the buyer during the sourcing process and an increase in the supplier’s opportunistic behavior following sourcing. We consider a setting in which the winning supplier decides on the level of quality to provide to the buyer, and we compare a standard reverse auction and a buyer-determined reverse auction, both analytically and in the laboratory. We find that the buyer-determined reverse auction can perform better than the standard reverse auction from both the buyer’s and the suppliers’ perspective. In a buyer-determined reverse auction, it may be optimal for the buyer to select the supplier who submitted a higher bid, which may in turn induce this supplier to deliver higher quality. Standard auctions, however, yield lower prices but reduce cooperation. The degree of trust, as reflected by a larger number of transactions and a higher average efficiency of trade, is significantly higher in buyer-determined reverse auctions.

This outperformance has major implications for almost all areas of agricultural economics and, if continued, will likely do so into the future. This article aims to identify the key ways in which the changes in rich and poor country growth rates matter for agricultural economists, as a basis for formulating better research agendas. A key impact arises through sharp increases in demand for agricultural resources as demand for livestock products increases. This changing structure of food demand has important implications for nutrition studies and policies, with the emergence of a double burden of malnutrition. On the supply side, growth in developing countries tends to increase domestic food supply, which is also boosted by increases in research and development spending. Growth in developing countries both stimulates and benefits from increases in infrastructure investment, evaluation of which requires new analytical tools. Negative impacts include the contribution of increased demand for livestock products to global greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of trade policy, growth in developing country is tending to lead to convergence of agricultural policies with the pattern of assistance seen in today's developed countries, raising concerns about the future need to deal with collective action problems, particularly those that increase the volatility of world prices. © 2019 International Food Policy Research Institute.

To secure access to resources, social innovators need to establish legitimacy for their initiatives. Yet, empirical work investigating the process of establishing legitimacy for social innovation—also known as legitimation—is absent. This research aims to uncover how legitimacy is established when social innovations are developed, over time, through interorganizational networks. To investigate this process, the research adopts a longitudinal case study of a network of five market-leading organizations in the home care sector. A process-based analysis of evidence from 33 meeting observations, 45 in-depth interviews, and 249 documents reveals three novel findings. (1) The attainment of overall legitimacy depends on the establishment, over time, of three types of legitimacy targeted at different audiences. These are framed as building blocks oriented toward achieving interorganizational, multilevel, and external legitimacy. (2) The process of establishing legitimacy, across the building blocks, is underpinned by two dominant combinations of patterns—denoted as courting and demonstrating commitment. (3) Variation in two underlying mechanisms—conflicting tensions and role promotion—drives the enactment of these patterns across the different building blocks. The study's novelty lies in the extrication of critical types of legitimacy and dominant patterns and mechanisms which underpin the process of establishing legitimacy. It contributes to social innovation and innovation legitimation literature by providing a deep-grained understanding of the process to establish legitimacy within social innovations carried out through interorganizational networks. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Access to resources; External legitimacies; In-depth interviews; Inter-organizational; Inter-organizational network; Longitudinal case study; Resource scarcity; Social innovations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074201670

Design/methodology/approach: Our Fulbright research, as described in this paper and performed by colleagues from the United States, Canada, Poland and Italy, examines executives’ as well as other less experienced employees’ preferences for different types of intuition versus data analysis. This study set out to better understand the degree to which executives prefer intuition versus analysis and the relationship between these approaches to decision-making. Our research combines elements of a review, a cross-cultural/cross-company survey study and a biometrics study in interoception. The research team has a multidisciplinary background in business, information technology, strategy, trust management, statistics and neuroscience. Findings: Based on our research, the main findings are as follows. The use of and preference for intuition types change as employees gain more experience. However, there may be intuition styles that are more static and trait-like, which are linked to roles, differentiating managers from leaders. Using “inferential intuition” and “seeing the big picture” go hand in hand. Listening to your body signals can promote improved intuition. Cross-cultural differences may impact executive decision-making. Executives often prefer to use their intuition over analysis/analytics. Research limitations/implications: This research could be expanded to have a larger sample size of C-level executives. We had 172 responses with 65% C-level executives and 12% directors. However, a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit on intuition used by executives had a sample of 174 executives around the world, which is comparable with our sample size. Practical implications: From our research, executives should continue to apply their experiential learning through intuition to complement their use of data in making strategic decisions. We have often discounted the use of intuition in executive decision-making, but our research highlights the importance of making it a critical part of the executive decision-making process. Originality/value: Based on the results of our survey and biometrics research, executives apply their intuition to gain greater confidence in their decision-making. Listening to their body signals can also improve their intuitive executive awareness. This complements their use of data and analytics when making executive decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Applied knowledge management; Innovation; Leadership","Biometrics; Data Analytics; Human resource management; Knowledge management; Surveys; Cross-cultural differences; Decision making process; Design/methodology/approach; Experiential learning; ITS applications; Leadership; Strategic decisions; Trust management; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072084630

Enterprises can operate individually or might also be part of a group of interconnected enterprises. For an enterprise operating as part of a (de)centralized group of enterprises with a similar or complementary mission and under the same or different ownership, the coordination of decisions and actions is important. Using the concept of network as an arrangement of interconnected nodes, this paper deals with enterprises as the members of a network, and with enterprise transactions as the connections among its members. We consider coordination exhibiting connectivity, feedback, and adaptation. These features are not only typical of enterprise networks, but also of complex adaptive systems (CAS). By considering enterprise networks as CAS, we study managerial policies that affect the coordination among the members of enterprise networks and the subsequent effect on technical efficiency both at the individual member enterprise and network levels. To approximate the effects of coordination-driven managerial policies, we consider flocking behavior from natural ecosystems, which the CAS literature studies, as a proxy for managerial policies. We simulate the relationships between managerial policies and technical efficiency in an enterprise network of deregulated power plants through an agent-based model. Experimental results inform when and how managerial policies enhance the coordination among network members and allow for the investigation of the relationships that exist between individual decisions and collective influences. These relationships result in an emergent goal seeking network behavior with respect to the goal of achieving technical efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Complex adaptive systems; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency measurement; Enterprise design; Managerial policies","Adaptive systems; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Managers; Complex adaptive systems; Coordination-driven; Efficiency measurement; Enterprise design; Enterprise networks; Interconnected nodes; Managerial policy; Technical efficiency; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058789873

An analysis of the impact of the BC carbon tax is of interest to various stakeholders in the jurisdiction where the tax was implemented. Other Canadian provinces and other countries contemplating a carbon tax policy are looking for insights on how to optimize potential positive and negative consequences. Given that government agri-environmental policies often emphasize farm-level support and environmental performance, there is interest in understanding the farm-level impacts of the carbon tax. The effect of the BC carbon tax on farm income and related production cost variables is investigated. Panel data from 2000 to 2015 are analyzed using both tabular and econometric approaches of the difference-in-difference method. The results indicate that the carbon tax is associated with a decline in net farm income-to-receipts ratios ranging between 8 and 12 cents per dollar of farm receipts. The analysis for costs-to-receipts ratios suggest that the carbon tax is directly related to higher commercial feed costs, farm labour costs, interest costs, and depreciation costs. Results of the regression analysis indicate that all the carbon tax effects are highly statistically significant. These findings can inform policy discussions about carbon tax effects on farmers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","British Columbia; Carbon tax; Farm-level impacts; Profitability","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Profitability; Regression analysis; Taxation; Wages; Agri-environmental policies; British Columbia; Carbon taxes; Depreciation costs; Difference-in-differences; Effect of carbons; Environmental performance; Policy discussion; Economic analysis; agri-environmental policy; black carbon; econometrics; farm; income; pollution tax; profitability; stakeholder; tax reform; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063237613

Despite the advantages these systems provide, their recommendation effectiveness is vulnerable to attacks from malicious users who inject biased ratings. Such attacks against recommender systems are called shilling attacks. Although several shilling attack detection mechanisms have been proposed in previous studies, their detection performance is limited in various attack conditions. Furthermore, few of these mechanisms consider the value-dimension associated with recommendations, which is crucial for e-retailers. This research proposes a novel approach called Value-based Neighbor Selection (VNS) to address the above limitations. The objective of this approach is to protect recommender systems from shilling attacks while improving e-retailers' profitability. It alleviates the aforementioned problems through strategically selecting neighbors whose preferences are then used to make recommendations. We have performed a series of empirical validations in various attack conditions to compare the performance of the proposed method and three benchmark methods, in terms of both recommendation accuracy and e-retailer profitability. The results show the advantages of the proposed method in balancing customer satisfaction and e-retailer profitability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Collaborative filtering; Profitability; Recommender systems; Shilling attacks","Benchmarking; Collaborative filtering; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Profitability; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering recommender systems; Detection performance; Empirical validation; Neighbor selection; Recommendation accuracy; Shilling attack detections; Shilling attacks; Value dimensions; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070660084

Drawing on the international marketing and retailing literatures, this study investigates how RBS affects the performance of global retailers in a longitudinal sample of 69 global retailers from multiple countries and sectors, across ten years. Findings indicate that the role of banner standardization in the successful performance of global retailers depends on retailer and market-level characteristics. Specifically, the results demonstrate that RBS improves retailer profitability as retailers increase their global penetration and emphasize status-based differentiation. Findings also suggest that banner standardization has stronger effects on profitability as retailers increase their focus on emerging markets and e-commerce. However, the authors also find that while RBS increases profits at low levels of global diversity, this effect becomes non-significant as retailers expand to highly diverse foreign markets. As such, the study provides important implications for global retailers while also filling the gap in banner/brand standardization/adaptation research that lies at the intersection of retailing and international marketing. © 2019 New York University","E-commerce; Emerging markets; Global branding; Profitability; Retail internationalization; Standardization/adaptation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065243461

Moreover, the variety of available methods and software tools makes it challenging for non-experts to identify the most appropriate analysis option. This research aims to assist non-experts in selecting the most appropriate set of analysis methods and software tools prior to conducting sustainable engineering analysis (SEA)based on life cycle data accessible to them. A questionnaire-based ranking methodology is developed for non-experts, which reduces their time investment in examining the myriad SEA methods and tools and avoids non-value added effort. The questionnaire uses an interaction matrix within a general mathematical modeling approach to map a given set of methods and tools to user responses. Relevance weights are integrated within the matrix to rank available environmental, economic, and social assessment methods and tools for user consideration. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, a pilot project was conducted to improve the design of a hexacopter. Results were compared using lower- and higher-fidelity software tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the relevance weights assigned to each tool. Assigned weights were determined to enable differentiation between low and high fidelity methods and tools, but as new methods and tools enter into use, these weights must be updated. The process of selecting SEA methods and software gives insight into the utility of the interaction matrix implemented within the tool developed in this research. Moreover, non-experts can compare various design alternatives using the selected analysis methods and software tools to arrive at a solution with improved sustainability performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainable engineering analysis (SEA); Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable product design","Computer software; Decision making; Life cycle; Product design; Surveys; High fidelity methods; Interaction matrices; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Ranking methodologies; Sustainability performance; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable product designs; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065395761

Design/methodology/approach: The hybrid modelling framework commences with system observation using field notes which culminate in model conceptualization to structure the problem. Thereafter, an SD-DEShybrid model is designed for the system, and simulated to proffer improvement programmes. The hybrid model emphasises the interactions between key constructs relating to the system, feedback structures and process flow concepts that are the hallmarks of many problems in production. The modelling framework is applied to the TPM operations of a bottling plant where sub-optimal TPM performance was affecting throughput performance. Findings: Simulation results for the case study show that intangible human factors such as worker motivation do not significantly affect TPM performance. What is most critical is ensuring full compliance to routine and scheduled maintenance tasks and coordinating the latter to align with rate of machine defect creation. Research limitations/implications: The framework was developed with completeness, generality and reuse in view. It remains to be applied to a wide variety of TPM and non-TPM-related problems.

We apply the model to bidding data from the world's largest flower wholesale market at which trades are facilitated through fast-paced, sequential, Dutch auctions. Using a two-step estimation approach, we are able to recover the structural parameters effectively and efficiently. We then conduct policy counterfactuals to evaluate the performance of alternative design choices. The results suggest that the current auction practice still has ample room for improvement.

Given the singular nature of these outcomes, a consultant attempting to sell a PSM intervention will struggle to articulate value to clients in terms that are commercially meaningful prior to the intervention being enacted. Thus, in order to win a contract to deliver a PSM intervention, the consultant must first resolve this puzzle. We explore this question by (i) reviewing how the value of PSMs has been assessed previously, (ii) setting out a suitable theoretical position to explore the problem and (iii) presenting empirical data from a commercial organization to build our theoretical position. This starts with agreement with Checkland and Scholes that attempting to sell the (financial) value of a PSM intervention a priori is unlikely to ever succeed. Our theoretical development through analysis of empirical data leads to the recognition that the process of selling a PSM intervention is bound to the interposition of the processes of problematization and interessement and the issue of trust. The recognition of a distinction between these and the actual enactment of a PSM intervention leads us to conclude that the process of selling the consulting engagement is entirely associated with the temporal ordering between them. We thus avoid the bind of the original puzzle only by articulating a paradox. To resolve the paradox, we shift analytical focus to the pre-contractual phase of the relationship between a consultant and client and discuss implications of this paradox for soft OR practice. © 2018 The authors.

We investigated consumer behavior in bicycle sharing in Beijing, where demand prediction is critical for cost-effective rebalancing of bicycle locations (putting bikes where and when they will be rented) and supply (number of bicycles). We created baseline statistical demand models, borrowing methods from economics, signal processing and animal tracking to find consumption cycles of 7, 12, 24 h and 7-days. Lorenz curves of bicycle demand revealed significant stratification of consumer behavior and a long-tail of infrequent demand. To overcome the limits of traditional statistical models, we developed a deep-learning model to incorporate (1) weather and air quality, (2) time-series of demand, and (3) geographical location of demand. Customer segmentation was added at a later stage, to explore potential for improvement with customer demographics. Our final machine learning model with tuned hyperparameters yielded around 50% improvement in predictions over a discrete wavelet transform model, and 80–90% improvement in predictions over a naïve model the reflects some current industry practice. We assessed causality in the deep-learning model, finding that location and air quality had the strongest causal impact on demand. The extreme market segmentation of customer demand, and our relatively short time span of data combined to make it difficult to find sufficient data on all customers for a model fit based on segmentation. We reduced our model data to only the 10 most frequent to see whether such segmentation improves our model's predictive success. These results, though limited, suggest that customer behavior within market segments is more stable than across all customers, as was expected. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bicycle sharing; Deep-learning; Demand prediction; Sharing economy; TensorFlow","Air quality; Bicycles; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Location; Sales; Signal processing; Bicycle sharing; Customer demographics; Customer segmentation; Demand prediction; Geographical locations; Machine learning models; Sharing economy; TensorFlow; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053937602

There have only been a few algorithms proposed for detecting spatial and/or temporal outliers. One example is the Local Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (LDBSCAN). Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is mainly for clustering; it just tells us whether an object belongs to a cluster or it is an outlier. A measure known as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) gives a quantitative measure of outlierness to each object, where a high LOF score means it is potentially an outlier. LDBSCAN algorithm, which combines the above notions, considers only the spatial context. Furthermore, the notion of a cluster is defeated (i.e. LDBSCAN may report clusters having less than the minimum required points in a cluster), and some of the outliers may not be detected because of the limitation of the existing conditions in the LDBSCAN algorithm. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, namely Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-BDBCAN) and Approx-ST-BDBCAN. ST-BDBCAN algorithm adopts the proposed, new concept, called Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Outlier Factor (ST-BOF), which is a spatio-temporal extension to LOF. It also uses both spatial and temporal attributes simultaneously to define the context. By doing so, the relative importance of spatial continuity or temporal continuity appropriate to the application at hand can be established. The Approx-ST-BDBCAN algorithm achieves improved scalability, with minimal loss of detection accuracy by partitioning data points for parallel processing. Experimental results on synthetic, and buoy datasets suggest that our proposed algorithms are accurate and computationally efficient. Additionally, new Outlier Association with Hurricane Intensity Index (OAHII) measures are introduced for quantitative evaluation of the results from buoy dataset. © 2017","Algorithms; Behavioral outlierness factor; Cluster; Efficiency; Hurricane; Spatio-temporal outliers","Algorithms; Data handling; Efficiency; Hurricanes; Object detection; Signal detection; Statistics; Behavioral outlierness factor; Cluster; Computationally efficient; Density-based Clustering; Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Quantitative evaluation; Quantitative measures; Spatio-temporal outliers; Clustering algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044255108

Design/methodology/approach: The possible actions that could be performed by a top manager were investigated in 12 case studies. These actions were grouped into key account managers and teams, culture, engagement and knowledge, organizational structure/conditions and customers and markets. Findings: Top managers (TMs) informally evaluate teams and key account (KA) managers, stimulate a culture that favors the information’s prospection, persuade managers to reduce their resistance and improve organizational structure/conditions by inducing internal and external questioning. They also contact key customers’ top managers to check on the changes required or to persuade them to change requirements, accept a higher price or redirect an unattractive order to competitors. They approve revisions on the key customers list, discuss with the key account manager how to redirect an unattractive opportunity to competitors and try to improve gains even in attractive orders. Research limitations/implications: Additional research beyond the provided exploratory study is needed to generalize the results. The findings contribute to improving the understanding of how TMs get involved in key account management, buyer–supplier relationship improvement and increasing company profitability.

Potential buyers may be reluctant to purchase such products online because of the limited ability to evaluate physical product attributes and to infer their performance in digital media. Retailers have been addressing this limitation by implementing visual product presentation technologies such as zoom and alternative photos. In addition, the widespread adoption and use of smartphones and tablets for online shopping poses another challenge for e-commerce retailers because of the devices' smaller displays and thus limited ability for visual product presentation. In this paper, we empirically investigate how the combination of visual product presentation technologies – via zoom and alternative photos – on mobile as well as non-mobile devices affect sales in online shopping. By utilizing a randomized field experiment, we find that alternative photos are associated with an increased purchase likelihood, while zoom is associated with a decreased purchase likelihood. For the devices, we find that the highest purchases likelihoods can be observed on PCs and tablets – potentially acting as substitutes for each other – followed by smartphones, which may be explained by their smaller display sizes. However, there is no significant interaction between devices and product presentation technologies.

This issue should be reached through the most appropriate and practical methods. In this study, based on how the external parameters would influence the productivity of a maintenance system the researcher aims at designing a dynamic system model to analyze the productivity of a maintenance system using acquired information from a car device company by determination of the percentage of parameters and indexes and their influence on maintenance system productivity. The proposed model is simulated for a system with parameters of precise value according to fixed and variable maintenance policies which the results are represented. The results of different policies described by using computerized simulation of the prepared model on VENSIM software. The time horizon of the systems can be considered from several years to several decades. This research considered 12 weeks for analyzing the system. This time was specified by consultation with experts in the first session of modeling. In such environment a model of productivity evaluation and operation of maintenance seems required that in this research by analyzing influential factors on maintenance system productivity of a factory and by means of acquired samples, it was possible to measure the ratio of maintenance system operation condition according to the posed indexes and their influences on productivity operation. This situation shows that to the extent that positive indexes in the diagram are higher to the same extent maintenance system productivity of company increases. © 2018, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Dynamic modeling; Maintenance system; Productivity; Rate and state variables","Computer software; Dynamic models; Productivity; Computerized simulation; Dynamic system modeling; Influential factors; Maintenance policy; Maintenance systems; Productivity evaluation; State variables; System dynamics model; Maintenance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064530667

Using a Monte Carlo simulation experiment, this paper compares the performance of six alternative methods commonly applied by regulators. Our results demonstrate that combination approaches, such as taking the maximum or the mean over DEA and SFA efficiency scores, have certain practical merits and might offer a useful alternative to strict reliance on a singular method. In particular, the results highlight that taking the maximum not only minimizes the risk of underestimation, but can also improve the precision of efficiency estimation.

In this grid, decision making is performed based on two indicators of Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and frequency of failures. The purpose of this paper is to improve DMG by recognizing interdependence among failures. Design/methodology/approach: Fault Tree Analysis and Reliability Block Diagram have been applied for improving DMG. The proposed approach has been examined on eight equipment of the steel making and continuous casting plant of Mobarakeh Steel Company. Findings: Findings indicate different positions of equipment in the cells of the new grid compared to the basic grid. Research limitations/implications: DMG is limited to two criteria of frequency of failures and MTTR values. In both basic and new DMGs, cost analysis has not been performed. The application of the proposed approach will help the reliability/maintenance engineers/analysts/managers to allocate more suitable maintenance tactics to equipment. This, in turn, will enhance the equipment life cycle and availability as the main objectives of physical asset management. Originality/value: A major limitation of basic DMG is that the determined tactic based on these two indicators might not be an appropriate solution in all conditions, particularly when failures are interdependent.

Customers arrive and purchase tickets according to their vehicle type and their willingness-to-pay, which typically increases over time because customers purchasing tickets closer to departure tend to accept higher prices. The optimization problem can be solved using dynamic programming but the possible states in the selling season are the set of all feasible vehicle mixes that fit onto the ferry. This makes the problem intractable as the number of vehicle types and ferry size increases. We propose a state space reduction, which uses a vehicle ferry loading simulator to map each vehicle mix to a remaining-space state. This reduces the state space of the dynamic program. Our approach allows the value function to be approximated rapidly and accurately with a relatively coarse discretization of states. We present simulations of the selling season using this reduced state space to validate the method. The vehicle ferry loading simulator was developed in collaboration with a vehicle ferry company and addresses real-world constraints such as manoeuvrability, elevator access, strategic parking gaps, vehicle height constraints and ease of implementation of the packing solutions. © 2018 The Author(s)","Dynamic pricing; Packing; Revenue management; Transportation","Costs; Dynamic programming; Economics; Heuristic methods; Packing; Sales; Transportation; Dynamic pricing; Heuristic approach; Number of vehicles; Optimization problems; Real world constraints; Revenue management; State-space reduction; Willingness to pay; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053207826

In the second stage, the study applies a bootstrap truncated regression to identify whether there is a relationship between the efficiency scores and a company-level activism index. Findings: The results show a negative correlation between the efficiency scores and the activism index, suggesting that activist shareholders tend to target less efficient companies. A time analysis over the period 2010-2014 does not offer evidence of impacts of activism on changes of the efficiency scores. Practical implications: Activist shareholders target less efficient companies. Shareholder activism increased after regulation that facilitated shareholder voting and required greater company transparency was introduced.

Much less attention has been paid to the role of organizational processes. In this research, based on a set of Chinese firms, we investigate how non-traditional organizational processes can foster cost innovation.

New HCV treatment drugs are very effective, but providing treatment to all inmates is prohibitively expensive, which precludes universal HCV treatment in prison systems. As such, current practice recommends prioritizing treatment based on clinical and incarceration-related factors, including disease staging, remaining sentence length, and injection drug use (IDU) status. However, there is controversy about how these factors should be incorporated because of the complicated trade-offs. In this study, we propose a restless bandit modeling framework to support hepatitis C treatment prioritization decisions in U.S. prisons. We first prove indexability for our problem and derive several structural properties of the well-known Whittle’s index, based on which we derive a closed-form expression of the Whittle’s index for patients with advanced liver disease. From the interpretation of this closed-form expression, we anticipate that the performance of the Whittle’s index would degrade as the treatment capacity increases, and to address this limitation, we propose a capacity-adjusted closed-form index policy. We parameterize and validate our model using real-world data and published studies and test the performance of our proposed policy against several benchmark policies using a realistic agent-based simulation model. Our results shed light on several controversial health policy issues in hepatitis C treatment prioritization: (1) prioritization based on only liver health status, a commonly practiced policy, is suboptimal compared with many other policies; further, considering remaining sentence length of inmates and IDU status in addition to liver health status in prioritization decisions can lead to a significant performance improvement; (2) while usually prioritizing patients with longer sentence lengths is the right choice, prioritizing patients with shorter remaining sentence lengths may be preferable if the treatment capacity inside the prison system is not very tight and the linkage-to-care level outside the prison system is low; and (3) among patients with advanced liver disease, IDUs should not be prioritized unless their reinfection is very well controlled. © 2019 INFORMS.","Agent-based simulation; Hepatitis C; Multi-armed bandits; Public health; Resource allocation; Treatment prioritization","Benchmarking; Controlled drug delivery; Disease control; Economic and social effects; Prisons; Public health; Resource allocation; Viruses; Agent based simulation; Agent-based simulation models; Closed-form expression; General population; Hepatitis C; Multi armed bandit; Prioritization; Treatment capacity; Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068443230

Identifying methods for mitigating the effects of anchors is important. Our experimental study utilises three abstract settings and arbitrary anchor values. We find strong anchoring effects in initial judgements. Providing disconfirming evidence of moderate helpfulness does, however, reduce the anchoring effects. Specifically, providing one or two items of disconfirming information is shown to have significant incremental benefits in reducing or even eliminating anchoring effects. However, surprisingly, providing three items of disconfirming information, in our setting, did not further reduce anchoring, suggesting some diminishing effect of additional evidence. This is consistent with prior research suggesting that individuals adjust until they are 'close enough', and then stop considering additional information. Our results have implications for a wide variety of judgement contexts, and the results are encouraging in suggesting that a relatively small quantity of disconfirming evidence could be sufficient for overcoming anchoring.

The project also aims to provide a global view that complements the traditional American/Western view. The purpose of this study is to investigate and report on some of these factors, in particular, the role that job satisfaction has in turnover intention (i.e., changing jobs within the IT industry) and turn-away intention (i.e., moving to another industry other than IT) in South Africa. Background Several studies have reported on the importance of an employee’s job satisfaction to organisation success, and the various factors that influence it. Most studies on job satisfaction adopted a Westernised and not a global view. Very few empirical studies have been conducted on job satisfaction of IT workers in South Africa. This paper reports on the individual, personal and organisational factors that influence the job satisfaction of IT staff in South Africa. Methodology The study uses statistical analysis of survey data acquired through the World IT Project. Both online and paper based questionnaires were used. A sample size of 301 respondents was obtained from the survey, which was conducted over a period of 6 months during 2017. The factors that influence IT job satisfaction were analysed using correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. The factors investigated were employee and organisational demographics, aspects of occupational culture, and various job-related individual issues. Contribution This paper presents the only study focused specifically on turnover and turn-away intention amongst IT staff in South Africa. The final proposed model, grounded in the empirical dataset, clearly shows job satisfaction as a strong mediating construct explaining most of the variance in the IT professional’s intention to leave the organisation (i.e. their turnover intention) and the industry (i.e. their turn-away intention). Findings The findings revealed that there was a significant correlation between job satisfaction and turnover intention as well as between job satisfaction and turn-away intention of IT staff. Perceived professional self-efficacy, strain and experience were also highly correlated with turnover intention. Professional self-efficacy was also significantly correlated with turn-away intention. Based on the analyses that were conducted, a research model is presented that shows the relationships between the various antecedents of turnover and turn-away intention. Recommendations Managers in organisations dealing with the shortage of IT skills can use the for Practitioners model to plan interventions to reduce IT staff turnover rates by focussing on addressing the identified individual issues such as strain, job (in)security and work load as well as the personal value and IT occupational culture issues. Recommendations Researchers in the field of IT staff recruitment and management can find value for Researchers for their research in the proposed refined model of IT job satisfaction and turnover intention. Future research could possibly replicate the study in other countries or could focus on different factors. Impact on Society IT skills play a crucial role in society today and are therefore in high demand. However, this demand is not being satisfied by the current rate of supply. Research into what factors influence IT staff to leave the organisation or the industry can assist managers with improving their employee relations and job conditions so as to reduce this turnover and increase organisations’ and society’s competitiveness and economic growth. Future Research It would be interesting to determine if the findings are similar for a sample of smaller organisations and/or younger IT employees since this study focussed on larger organisations and more experienced staff. Future research could also compare the findings of South African organisations with those in other countries. © 2019 Informing Science Institute.

A win-win pricing strategy for the players in the data supply chain is proposed. We obtain analytical solutions in each pricing mechanism, including the decentralised and centralised pricing, Nash bargaining pricing, and revenue sharing mechanism. Our findings show that: 1) the decentralised pricing has the lowest performance; 2) although Nash bargaining pricing can achieve the centralised channel performance, the upstream data provider and downstream application provider can only equally divide the total channel profit; 3) revenue sharing mechanism, in which the data provider subsidises the application provider, can achieve the first best performance and divide the maximum profit arbitrarily. Accordingly, end-users benefit mostly from the bargaining pricing and revenue sharing.

Among other factors, the self-interested behavior of stakeholders, called autonomous agents (AAs) in game theory, has affected LC performance. AAs make decisions for their own benefit rather than for the sake of the project. This paper presents an exploration of the potential impacts that the behavior of subcontractors, as AAs, have had on the performance of LC tools, such as the last planner system (LPS). A qualitative approach was used to collect data through personal interviews with 74 participants in eight projects, built by four construction companies, throughout Texas. A quantitative approach was used to analyze the interviews. The findings were as follows: (1) subcontractors behaved as AAs; (2) the LPS did not prevent the behavior of subcontractors AAs, but it supported the management of issues by the behavior of the subcontractors as AAs; and (3) the behavior of subcontractors as AAs affected LPS performance. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on engineering management by identifying a problem affecting LC, prompting academics and practitioners to investigate solutions that will benefit the labor productivity of the industry. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Autonomous agent; Construction; Game theory; Labor productivity; Last planner system; Lean; Self-interested; Subcontractor","Construction; Construction industry; Contractors; Game theory; Productivity; Labor productivity; Last planner system; Lean; Self-interested; Subcontractor; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054827473

Accordingly, our understanding of the role structure plays in care coordination is limited. Purpose: In this article, we explore service line structure, with an aim of advancing our understanding of the role service line structure plays in producing coordinated, patient-centered care. We do so by giving special attention to the cognitive roots of patient-centeredness. Methodology/Approach: Our exploratory study relied on comparative case studies of the breast cancer service lines in three health systems. Nonprobability discriminative snowball sampling was used to identify the final sample of key informants. We employed a grounded approach to analyzing and interpreting the data. Results: We found substantial variation across the three service lines in terms of their structure. We also found corresponding variation across the three case sites in terms of where informant attention was primarily focused in the process of coordinating care. Drawing on the attention-based view of the firm, our results draw a clear connection between structural characteristics and the dominant focus of attention (operational tactics, provider roles and relationships, or patient needs and engagement) in health care service lines. Conclusion: Our exploratory results suggest that service line structures influence attention in two ways: (a) by regulating the type and intensity of the problems facing service line participants and (b) by encouraging (or discouraging) a shared purpose around patient needs. Practice Implications: Patient-centered attention - a precursor to coordinated, patient-centered care - depends on the internal choices organizations make around service line structure. Moreover, a key task for organizational and service line leaders is to structure service lines to create a context that minimizes distractions and enables care providers to focus their attention on the needs of their patients. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The findings reveal that the long-term persistence effect of detailing is more pronounced for specialist physicians, whereas the contemporaneous marginal effect is higher for generalists. The paper also provides a key methodological insight to the marketing and economics literature. In the Nerlove–Arrow framework, moment conditions that are typically used in conventional dynamic panel data methods become vulnerable to serial correlation in the error structure.We discuss the associated biases and present a robust set of moment conditions for both lagged dependent and predetermined explanatory variables. Furthermore, we show that conventional tests to detect serial correlation have weak power, resulting in the misuse of moment conditions that leads to incorrect inference.

This draws on limited resources of attention and requires economizing on attention devoted to signals related to economic behaviour. A natural measure of such costs is based on Shannon's ""channel capacity"". Modelling economic agents as constrained by Shannon capacity as they process freely available information turns out to imply that discretely distributed actions, and thus actions that persist across repetitions of the same decision problem, are very likely to emerge in settings that without information costs would imply continuously distributed behaviour. We show how these results apply to the behaviour of an investor choosing portfolio allocations, as well as to some mathematically simpler ""tracking"" problems that illustrate the mechanism. Trying to use costs of adjustment to explain ""stickiness"" of actions when interpreting the behaviour in our economic examples would lead to mistaken conclusions. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

I show that under simple and easily verifiable conditions, the placebo test leads to asymptotically valid inference in a very large class of empirically relevant models.

Because filtered estimates are based on current and past observations, such Taylor rules appear to exhibit interest rate smoothing even though the monetary authority has no explicit preference for smooth interest rates. Under such a Taylor rule, the estimates of inflation and the output gap are perfectly negatively correlated. In the data, these gaps are slightly positively correlated, suggesting that the central bank is systematically underreacting to estimated inflation and the output gap. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Interest rate rules; Monetary policy; Taylor rules","central bank; inflation; interest rate; Keynesian theory; monetary policy; numerical model; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070540480

This study pioneers the exploration of whether different built environment profession stakeholders (i.e., the practitioner/individual professional, the practitioner's organization/company, and the professional body/association) have different abilities to influence improvement (i.e., positive change) in unethical practices, and subsequently whether such phenomenon manifests differently in different national contexts. The study used cross-sectional surveys of built environment surveying professionals in three countries: Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania. The findings revealed that there are significant differences in the abilities of stakeholders to influence improvement in unethical practices like political interference, discrimination, and nepotism. The findings further revealed that differences in stakeholder ability to influence improvement in unethical practices can manifest differently in different national contexts. The implication is that, in different national contexts, specific stakeholders could play a leading role in efforts to address unethical practices in which they are more capable of influencing improvement. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Ethics; Questionnaire survey; Surveying profession; Unethical practices","Civil engineering; Engineering education; Built environment; Cross-sectional surveys; Ethics; Nigeria; Positive changes; Questionnaire surveys; Tanzania; Unethical practices; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069954701

Guyana's pathway to economic domination by mineral extraction has taken a distinctly different path from other mineral-intensive countries in that the majority of extraction has been from small and medium scale operators. A single Canadian-owned gold mine was the only representation of the large-scale sector for much of the time period. Guyana's unique mining industry has evolved as a result of the increasing international gold price, its political history and crucially government policy that legalised, regulated and encouraged small and medium scale activity much more prominently than large-scale activities. Chief to this policy position was the establishment of a legislative framework that creates a structure for Guyanese small and medium scale miners to obtain property rights and mine legally. This paper draws on interview evidence and secondary data to reflect upon the impact that this policy position has had upon the economic, social and environmental consequences of the growth of the mining industry in the country. Economically the policy helped to maintain value within Guyana, but may not have fully insulated the country from the resource curse. Although a large value was created for consumption by Guyanese miners and their families, little of this was captured by government for investment in long-term infrastructure. The industry also provided a valuable source of employment for low-skilled local labour, helping to absorb individuals from diminishing industries such as sugar. Socially the industry has created problems such as prostitution, human trafficking and crime, especially in remote areas. However, it may have proved as an important safety valve, providing income and activity for otherwise disaffected low-skilled individuals. Environmentally the industry has created problems due to mercury pollution and deforestation but there is space within the legislative structure for the industry to become an agent of change for restoration and land reclamation. © 2019","Guyana; Mining legislation; Mining policy; Small-scale mining","Deforestation; Economic geology; Extraction; Investments; Land reclamation; Miners; Mining laws and regulations; Sugar industry; Guyana; Human trafficking; International gold price; Legislative frameworks; Mercury pollution; Mineral extraction; Small-scale mining; Social and environmental; Industrial economics; economic growth; environmental impact; extraction; legislation; policy making; property rights; small scale mining; socioeconomic impact; Guyana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067466060

Design/methodology/approach: This study proposed a hybrid approach that integrates word frequency analysis, cluster analysis, grey theory and the decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Specifically, this study identifies useful criteria using quantitative word frequency analysis as well as qualitative literature research. Then, cluster analysis is used to divide these criteria into different categories. Subsequently, this study applies the grey theory associated with the DEMATEL method to assess the sustainability performance of high-tech firms. Findings: The results reveal that the socio-environment is an important aspect underlying the corporate sustainability performance of high-tech firms. Therefore, high-tech firms should enhance their pollution emission control capabilities and increase investment in energy-conservation and emission-reduction technologies to drive sustainable development. In addition, increasing green product sales revenue and improving the guiding capability of green consumption are core issues that firms must address. Originality/value: This study assesses the sustainability performance of high-tech firms by applying a hybrid method. This method can be used to construct a framework for scientific sustainability performance assessment and to provide a clear direction for the sustainable development of firms. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Assessment; High-tech firms; Sustainability performance","Behavioral research; Cluster analysis; Decision making; Decision theory; Economics; Emission control; Investments; Linguistics; Planning; Assessment; Corporate-sustainability; Design/methodology/approach; Energy conservation and emission reductions; High-tech firms; Quantitative and qualitative researches; Scientific rationalities; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071532305

In a counterfactual scenario, a social planner goes through the same process to maximize total welfare. We show that in both scenarios the problem of dynamically pricing heterogeneous-quality (vertically differentiated) inventories is equivalent to that of dynamically pricing homogeneous-quality inventories, in the sense that a solution to one implies a solution to the other. Moreover, we prove a strong scarcity result, which suggests that the sale of a product drives up the prices on all remaining products, whether of higher or lower quality. We then consider product line design under a production technology that utilizes costly and potentially limited resources. We show that with unlimited (but costly) resources, the revenue maximizer undersupplies quality to all products compared with the social planner. With limited resources, we show that the revenue maximizer exhibits elitism: he overallocates (underallocates) resources on the production of high-quality (low-quality) products. However, as the volume of expected consumer arrivals increases to infinity, both the revenue maximizer and the welfare maximizer allocate resources equally across products. © 2018 INFORMS.","Product line design; Resource allocation; Revenue management; Welfare analysis","Costs; Product design; Resource allocation; Design and dynamics; Product line design; Production technology; Quality profile; Revenue management; Social planners; Total welfare; Welfare analysis; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072328253

Using a regression discontinuity specification around the lower cutoff of the Russell 2000 small-cap index, we find that index membership causes small firms to transition away from bank financing in favor of seasoned equity offerings. These effects are concentrated in the year following Russell 2000 additions and do not reverse immediately upon deletions. Liquidity, the elasticity of demand for equity, and analyst coverage also significantly increase following Russell 2000 additions but do not significantly decrease following deletions. Finally, firms added to the Russell 2000 obtain lower spreads and have fewer covenants on the bank loans that they do initiate. Our findings are consistent with index membership mitigating the financing frictions of small firms by improving their information environment through increased investor awareness. © 2018 INFORMS.","Bank borrowing; Index membership; Seasoned equity offerings; Securities issuance","Management; Operations research; Analyst coverages; Bank borrowing; Bank loans; Elasticity of demand; Index membership; Information environment; Seasoned equity offerings; Securities issuance; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070327689

They enhance customer satisfaction by eliminating physical lines but may compromise efficiency. Existing studies offer mixed results on the cause and magnitude of such inefficiency. These results, however, are based on simplistic customer behaviors. Taking a holistic approach, we examine how realistic customer behaviors drive ticket queue performance. Our empirical studies reveal that (i) customers are capable of adapting their patience to the waiting context and (ii) they use dynamic updating to improve forecasting and decision making over time. Once we model these two behaviors, we find the ticket queue inefficiency is much smaller than the literature predicted. By testing and highlighting the central role of realistic customer behaviors, this paper advances our understanding on ticket queue theory and practice. © 2019 INFORMS.","Customer behaviors; Dynamic updating; Markov; Service systems; Ticket queue","Decision making; Queueing theory; Sales; Customer behavior; Dynamic updating; Markov; Service systems; Ticket queue; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067202852

To understand customers' search behavior when they are confronted with a large collection of vertically differentiated, congested service providers, we build a model in which arriving customers conduct a costly sequential search to resolve uncertainty about service providers' quality and queue length and select one to join by optimal stopping rules. Customers search, in part, because of variations in waiting time across service providers, which, in turn, is determined by the search behavior of customers. Thus, an equilibrium emerges. We characterize customers' equilibrium search/join behavior in a mean field model as the number of service providers grows large. We find that reducing either the search cost or customer arrival rate may increase the average waiting time in the system as customers substitute toward high-quality service providers. Moreover, with lower search costs, the improved quality obtained by customers may not make up for the prolonged wait, therefore degrading the average search reward and, more importantly, decreasing customer welfare; when customers search, their welfare can even be lower than if they are not allowed to search at all. © 2019 INFORMS.","Customer welfare; Quality substitution; Queueing games; Search; Waiting time","Economic and social effects; Mean field theory; Queueing theory; Average waiting-time; Customer welfare; High quality service; Optimal stopping rule; Quality differentiation; Queueing games; Search; Waiting-time; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071146227

Our paper provides evidence of a link between an organization's culture—specifically the trust environment—and its level of specialization. We show experimentally that exogenously-imposed culture endogenously leads to variation in organizational form. We prime trust and demonstrate that the level of trust within an organization affects division of labor and consequently productivity in nonhierarchical teams. This evidence is consistent with a cross-country link between trust and the division of labor that we observe in data from the European Social Survey. Managerial Summary: Firms vary among many dimensions such as culture and internal organization even within the same industry. Trust is one component of corporate culture that is crucial for cooperation within organizations. In this paper, we show that the trust dimension of corporate culture can affect firm performance through internal structure, in particular the degree of division of labor. Using evidence from a game-theoretic model, a lab experiment, and country-level data, we show that an increase in trust leads to increased worker specialization. Our results suggest that increasing trust in work environments where division of labor is beneficial is one way to boost team productivity.

The available data cover a wide range of properties across time and include the financial crisis period in Greece which led to tremendous changes in the dynamics of the real estate market. We formulate and compare linear and non-linear models based on regression, hedonic equations and artificial neural networks. The forecasting ability of each method is evaluated out-of-sample. Special care is given on measuring the success of the forecasts but also on identifying the property characteristics that lead to large forecasting errors. Finally, by examining the strengths and the performance of each method we apply a combined forecasting rule to improve forecasting accuracy.

In the absence of opinion on how the indicators should be aggregated, we focus on the uncertainty this brings to the composite results. We use a large two-stage Monte Carlo simulation to generate possible aggregation weights and examine the discrimination in the composite results.

As such, utilities should leverage these dynamic perceptions for a variety of reasons, including identifying strategic times to increase operational revenues through rate changes or billing structure, implementing capital projects or management approaches, or integrating new policies. This study focuses on assessing the temporal variations of stated willingness to pay for improved water and wastewater service of residents in 21 shrinking US cities. This classification of cities was selected due to the fiscal constraints placed on utilities because of the reduced number of customers from that which the original system was designed to serve. Furthermore, a consequence of this decline, a high proportion of low-income residents are paying high per-capita costs. Enabling this study are survey data collected in 2013 and 2016. Random-parameter Tobit regression models are used to identify geographic and sociodemographic factors influencing this stated willingness to pay. A likelihood ratio test confirmed a statistically significant shift between the surveys in the residents' stated willingness to pay. Model results reveal that between the timeframes of the deployed surveys, the influences of geographic (e.g., Michigan, Ohio) and sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, income) changed as well. Utilities may benefit from using the identified parameters to develop strategies (e.g., outreach programs, targeted education, media advertisements, inclusion in planning) to target specific groups.

However, very few have focused on how tourists make plans for their trips when travelling in groups. This paper adds to the knowledge of the decision-making process of tourist groups with a specific focus on intra-group interaction and the support of technology. This research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining two studies. Study 1 employed a focus group to gain an understanding of the decision-making process within a tourist group, while Study 2 employed a questionnaire survey to explore how the use of technology in such a process varies among different categories of groups. Study 1 proposed a model for a group holiday decision-making process with four components: information acquisition, intra-group information sharing, knowledge transfer, and decision making. It was adapted from the “Infogineering Model” and the encoding and decoding theory in communication studies. Study 2 identified new influential factors on the use of technology by tourist groups for decision making. Ultimately, this research produced a number of theoretical implications, as well as practical implications in terms of how practitioners can better support Chinese tourists, family travellers, and tourists with little prior travel experience, and how technology can facilitate group holiday decision making. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural differences; Human factors; Tourist groups; Travel decision-making; Use of technology","Distributed computer systems; Human engineering; Knowledge management; Surveys; Cultural difference; Decision making process; Encoding and decoding; Information acquisitions; Information sharing; Questionnaire surveys; Tourist groups; Travel decisions; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065606902

A critical piece of information for producers/publishers of content as well as advertisers is the demographics of the consumers who are likely to visit a given web site. In this article we explore predictive models that attempt to deduce the demographics of the audience of a web site using cues embedded in the design or the content of its homepage. We find that it is possible to effectively predict different types of demographics of consumers of web sites on the basis of the suggested approach. Through a statistical analysis we observe that several design elements and the content differ significantly among web sites dominated by consumers of different demographic classes. We also suggest the use of an ensemble classifier that combines the content and design cues with the goal of further improving the prediction performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Audience demographics; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Text classification","Classification (of information); Forecasting; Learning systems; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Text processing; Websites; Audience demographics; Design elements; Ensemble classifiers; Homepage; Prediction performance; Predictive models; Text classification; Web Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058231589

Because of its low cost, social media marketing is especially appealing to customer-to-customer (C2C) sellers. Customers can also benefit from social media marketing by learning about products and by interacting with sellers in real time. However, a seller's marketing microblogs may backfire on her for dominating the social space. Defining the marketing popularity as the average number of likes each seller receives per marketing-related microblog and defining the marketing aggressiveness level as the proportion of her marketing-related microblogs, this paper empirically quantifies the optimal level of marketing aggressiveness in social media to achieve the maximum popularity. We gather the data from China's largest microblogging platform, Sina Weibo, and the sellers in our sample are from China's largest C2C online shopping platform, Taobao. We find that the empirical relationship between the marketing aggressiveness level and the marketing popularity follows an inverted U-shape curve, where the optimal level is around 30%. In addition, we find a saturation effect of the number of followers on marketing popularity after it reaches around 100,000. Our findings imply that social media marketing should not overlook customers’ social needs. Our measure of marketing aggressiveness provides a dynamic business metric for practitioners to monitor so as to improve their marketing and managerial decision making process. © 2018","Aggressiveness; Electronic commerce; Marketing; Microblog; Popularity; Social media","aggressiveness; article; China; decision making; electronic commerce; female; human; marketing; physician; shopping; social media; social needs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048330302

While virtual teams offer incentives in terms of flexibility and cost savings, engineering firms should be aware of added challenges that yield low-performing teams or result in failure. These challenges, in essence, are driven by the geographic dispersion of members, core reliance on communication technology, and composition of various cultures. The subject research follows a highly practical approach, providing specific practices for mitigation of the identified challenges. A survey study was conducted to gather data from engineering practitioners at a global professional services firm involved in virtual engineering projects between 2017 and 2018. Research conducted across best practices for virtual teams, coupled with the survey results, yielded a framework of five overarching themes to enable high-performing virtual engineering teams: technology integration, management of virtual resources, project governance controls, stakeholder engagement, and organizational drivers. Resulting practices are presented across the five themes of the framework.

However, the research on the role of buyer-supplier relationship and adoption of social compliance standards is limited. Using data from apparel exporting factories, this paper investigates the role of transactional and relational buyer-supplier relationships in the adoption of public and private standards. Further, it examines the moderating role of supplier's organizational values in standards adoption process. The results indicate that transactional approach has a positive association with public standards and relational approach has a positive association with private standards. Also, the combined presence of transactional and relational approaches leads to implementation of both public and private standards. The empirical examination yielded partial support for moderation hypotheses as well. The findings imply that supplier governance decisions should be linked with the format of social compliance. A transactional approach will add more value when public standards are adopted and a relational approach will create more value if private standards are adopted. Further, managers need to evaluate a supplier's flexibility and external orientation to predict supplier willingness for social compliance and future social performance. © 2018","Buyer-supplier relationship; Empirical research; Purchasing; Regression analysis; Supplier social compliance","Commerce; Developing countries; Purchasing; Regression analysis; Sales; Buyer supplier relationship; Developed countries; Empirical examination; Empirical research; Social performance; Standards adoptions; Supplier social compliance; Regulatory compliance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060006035

In another stream of outsourcing studies, researchers have gauged the degree of outsourcing, unearthing how companies may choose to outsource a set or processes instead of the whole business function. In this article, we draw on both of these streams of outsourcing research to study the relationship between outsourcing motivations and the degree of outsourcing within a particular business function. We probe the effect of nine motivation items on outsourcing decision through an empirical study using survey data gathered from 337 small and medium-sized enterprises. We find that cost reduction, a focus on core competence and business/process improvements are all associated with a higher degree of outsourcing, but interestingly, access to expertise is negatively associated with the degree of outsourcing. This finding suggests that companies that outsource mainly to acquire external expertise outsource only a limited number of processes within a specific business function. Our main theoretical contribution lies in uncovering the dynamic nature of outsourcing motivations, meaning that as companies outsource a larger degree of their business processes, some motivation items become more accentuated and others fade in importance. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2019.","accounting; Business process outsourcing; degree of outsourcing; outsourcing motivation; survey","Cost reduction; Motivation; Nuclear fuel accounting; Surveying; Surveys; Business functions; Business Process; Business process outsourcing; Core competence; Dynamic nature; Empirical studies; Outsourcing decisions; Small and medium sized enterprise; Outsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061176000

First, using a latent Markov model and longitudinal survey data spanning 15 years, we produce a dynamic life course model with transitions over time. Second, we link a modified Bass diffusion model — using both static and dynamic parameters — to our model, augmenting it with a second cross-sectional consumer behavior data set. The results show comparatively strong consumption spending, high media interaction, but diminishing social inclusion in old age, though all factors exhibit heterogeneity among old-age clusters. Employing dynamic diffusion models, we find that a static view of the elderly market that ignores life course transitions generally overestimates their spending power. Forecasts of cluster-specific adoption dynamics draw a differentiated picture of individual clusters' attractiveness. Our analysis underscores the influence of life events on individual behavior and shows that a dynamic view of elderly markets yields a more nuanced and accurate assessment of their potential and attractiveness. It also confirms that social status and income strongly affect consumer behavior and spending, though we identify several exceptions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aging; Consumer lifetime value; Diffusion model; Innovation; Longitudinal model; Targeting","Aging of materials; Commerce; Diffusion; Markov processes; Bass Diffusion Model; Diffusion model; Individual behavior; Lifetime values; Longitudinal models; Longitudinal surveys; Marketing innovations; Targeting; Consumer behavior; aging; consumption behavior; elderly population; empirical analysis; innovation; marketing; Markov chain; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059880192

Furthermore, if firms received both types of support from government, their survival rate was around two times as high compared to only receiving a single support. The likelihood of survival depended on the amount of assistance a firm received. We also find firm ownership impacts on its survival pattern. Lastly, China joining the World Trade Organisation (WTO) coincided with (cet. par.) higher firm failure, especially with regard to state-owned firms; however, this period also saw the authorities targeting political and financial help on the ‘better’ firms (especially SOEs) with characteristics likely to increase their chance of survival. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Financial assistance; firm survival; political links","data set; economic history; finance; firm ownership; numerical model; political economy; state owned enterprise; state role; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053281629

The aim is to understand which individual goals and social preferences planners pursue and how these influence planners’ decisions. Design/methodology/approach: Propositions are developed based on investigation of decision making of transport planners in a Dutch logistics service provider using multiple data collection methods. Findings: The study shows how decision making of transport planners is motivated by individual goals as well as social preferences for reciprocity and group identity. Research limitations/implications: Further research including transaction data analysis is needed to triangulate findings and to strengthen conclusions. Propositions are developed to be tested in future research. Practical implications: Results suggest that efforts to guide planners in their decision making should go beyond traditional (monetary) incentives and consider their individual goals and social preferences. Moreover, this study provides insight into why transport planners deviate from desired behaviour.

Excess capacity can be used as an economic strategy for entry deterrence by lowering average costs over a greater range of output, and as an operations strategy by providing value through flexibility to manage demand fluctuations and production disturbances. Our primary focus is to study the way that information technology (IT) can contribute to a strategy of holding excess capacity by comparing the relationship between IT capital and capacity with that of non-IT capital and capacity. Using production theory–based empirical analyses, we find that increases in IT capital yield almost fourfold greater expansion in capacity than do increases in non-IT capital. Thus, as both types of capital are constraints on capacity, for a strategy of holding excess capacity IT capital is a more valuable constraint to relax than non-IT capital. In addition, since the late 1990s, IT capital, and to a lesser extent, non-IT capital, has reduced capacity utilization (output/capacity), meaning increasing levels of excess capacity are being held across manufacturing industries and utilities across the economy.

This is arguably due to the increased level of consciousness in society on sustainability issues; and the significant impacts of campus activities on both environment and communities. Also, digital technologies such as websites, online discussion forums, social media, content-sharing platforms, mobile apps, and wearable devices are now accessible for young people to learn about and promote their physical fitness and health. Therefore, in this paper, the impact of the ergonomic architectural design of gym, and social network on the desire of students for sports activities is investigated. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 500 students (275 girls and 225 boys; age 12-18 years), who responded to research questionnaires. The data were analyzed using PLS-SEM and Smart-PLS version 3.2. The obtained results showed the high strength of the proposed model.

Whether and which individual mobile data users are forward looking by dynamically balancing present and future usage and how to design profitable promotions targeting these users are questions of both academic and managerial interest. By developing a dynamic structural model and formally proving its theoretical properties, we discover distinct temporal usage patterns that can distinguish forward-looking users from myopic ones. An empirical test is constructed to test for individual forward-looking behavior by matching the observed usage patterns with the theoretical results. We find a considerable proportion of users (about 40%) are indeed forward looking and also find empirical evidence of individual consumer myopia. Our approach enables us to apply the dynamic model only to those exhibiting forward-looking behavior. It hence serves as a feasible option to control for consumer myopia in estimating dynamic structural models given the inherent limitation that individual discount factors are generally unidentifiable. Our structural model is shown to accurately capture the dynamic trends observed in the actual usage data. It enables sophisticated counterfactual simulations incorporating various factors (e.g., consumer anticipation, plan switch) to deliver rich implications for targeted promotion design. As we find, promotions targeting only forward-looking consumers could be significantly more profitable than blanket promotions uniformly applied to all. Properly designed end-ofmonth promotions targeting forward-looking users could help mobile carriers fully utilize the otherwise excess network bandwidth and increase revenue at little extra cost. © 2019 INFORMS.","Consumer myopia; Dynamic consumption pattern; Forward-looking behavior; Individual heterogeneity; Mobile data; Targeted promotion","Ophthalmology; Profitability; Consumer myopia; Consumption patterns; Forward looking; Individual heterogeneity; Mobile data; Targeted promotion; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068606597

Existing attribution models predominantly focus on analyzing consumers' conversion paths with respect to one focal firm while largely overlooking the impact of their interactions with competing firms, leading to biased estimates of advertising effectiveness. We address this problem by developing an integrated individual-level choice model that considers consumers' online visit and purchase decisions across all competitors within one industry. We specifically analyze the effects of multichannel advertising on (1) consumer choice of entry site, (2) consumer search decisions concerning the remaining competing websites, and (3) subsequent purchase at one of the searched websites. We quantify the impact of different digital advertising channels on consumers' decisions at different purchase funnel stages based on individuallevel click stream data from the online air ticket booking industry. We find that information stock of all online channels considered-search, display/referral, email, direct-contributes significantly to consumers' visit and purchase decisions, among which search is the most effective advertising channel in driving all three decisions. We map the estimates to the conversion attribution of different channels. The result reveals that the relative contribution of the display/referral channel was underestimated under the popular single-firm attribution models by a factor of two on average. In terms of predictive performance, our model consistently outperforms the single-firm model in predicting the occurrences of future purchases. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

Background In the increasingly competitive knowledge-based economy, companies must seek innovative methods of doing business, quickly react to consumer demand, and provide superior value to consumers. Simultaneously, contemporary consumers, named “prosumers”, want to be active co-creators of value and satisfy their consumption needs through collaboration with companies for co-creation, co-design, co-production, co-promotion, co-pricing, co-distribution, co-consumption, and co-maintenance. Consequently, consumer involvement in development and improvement of products and business process must be widely analyzed in various contexts. Methodology The research is a questionnaire survey study of 388 prosumers in Poland and 76 in the UK. Contribution The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it identifies how prosumers can be engaged in business processes through knowledge sharing. Second, it investigates the differences between Poland- and UK-based prosumers in engagement in business process. Findings The study found that prosumers are engaged in knowledge sharing at each stage of the business process innovation framework. However, there are differences in the types of processes that draw on prosumers’ engagement. Prosumers in Poland are found to engage mostly in the business process of developing and managing products, whereas prosumers in the UK engage mostly in the business process of managing customer services. Recommendations This study provides practitioners with guidelines for engaging prosumers and for Practitioners their knowledge sharing to improve process innovation. Companies gain new insight from these findings about prosumers’ knowledge sharing for process innovation, which may help them make better decisions about which projects and activities they can engage with prosumers for future knowledge sharing and creating prospective innovations. Recommendations Researchers may use this methodology and do similar analysis with different for Researchers samples in Poland, the UK, and other countries, for many additional comparisons between different groups and countries. Moreover, a different methodology may be used for identifying prosumers’ engagement and knowledge sharing for processes improvement. Future Research This study examined prosumers’ engagement from the prosumers’ standpoint. Therefore prosumers’ engagement from the company perspective should be explored in future research. © 2019 Informing Science Institute.

Using comprehensive state-level data in the United States during 2004-2010, our findings show that there is no clear empirical evidence that the Internet penetration rate is related to the number of Internet crime perpetrators; however, cybercriminal activities are contingent upon socioeconomic factors and connection speed. Specifically, a higher income, more education, a lower poverty rate, and a higher inequality are likely to make the Internet penetration be more positively related with cybercrime perpetrators, which are indeed different from the conditions of terrestrial crime in the real world.

Under this type of threshold models, there only exists an association between the predictor of interest and the outcome when the predictor is less than some threshold value. Just like hinge models, upper hinge models can be seen as a special case of the more general segmented or two-phase regression models. The importance of studying upper hinge models is that even though they only have one fewer degree of freedom than segmented models, they can be estimated with much greater efficiency. We develop a new fast grid search algorithm to estimate upper hinge linear regression models. The new algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the search algorithm dramatically and renders the existing fast grid search algorithm inadmissible. The fast grid search algorithm makes it feasible to construct bootstrap confidence intervals for upper hinge linear regression models; for upper hinge generalized linear models of non-Gaussian family, we derive asymptotic normality to facilitate construction of model-robust confidence intervals. We perform numerical experiments and illustrate the proposed methods with two real data examples from the ecology literature. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Change point; Dynamic programming; Ecological threshold; Segmented models","algorithm; ecosystem dynamics; numerical model; regression analysis; threshold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075548517

The underlying premise is that the poor desire the same cornucopia of goods and services as more affluent counterparts, seeking alternative ways to enter their material worlds. However, studies have suggested that consumers who live in relative poverty, or below their societal consumption adequacy baseline, may think and behave differently than other, more affluent consumers. To consider one possible example, we examine the relative healthfulness of food choices by consumers in a participant-subject pool compared to individuals living in an impoverished community.

However, in recent years, many adverse impacts of commercial bioenergy projects have come to the forefront. These include limited ecological benefits, heightened food insecurity across many developing countries as well as exploitation of local residents by bioenergy producers. There remains a dearth of empirical evidence devoted to investigating bioenergy's potential as a sustainable energy alternative in developing countries. It is against this background that our paper is aimed at making two contributions: one, to provide a ground level empirical data on bioenergy initiatives in the Indian Punjab region and, two, to examine the theoretical contribution of eco-socialist perspective to assess the sustainability potentials of bioenergy in developing economies. The eco-socialist perspective treats environmental degradation as a ‘systemic issue’ and considers the power and class structures in capitalism as the central explanatory parameters in explaining the process of environmental degradation. As a part of the transition from capitalism to eco-socialism, the eco-socialists advocate for a participatory approach to environmental decision making to ensure that ecological justice emerges as the central parameter of sustainable development. The theoretical framing of the case study research on bioenergy projects in the region of Punjab, India was informed by the eco-socialist vision. The case study employed a ‘multiple stakeholder’ approach to explore the opportunities and contestations surrounding bioenergy projects in Punjab. Identifying key flaws as well as the promises of bioenergy in Punjab that were investigated, our research revealed that in order to be a sustainable energy alternative that meets the objective of ecological and social justice, bioenergy policies need to address the needs of local communities and be cognizant of the inherent socio-economic embeddedness of these initiatives. © 2019","Bioenergy; Case study; Eco-socialism; Environmental justice; Stakeholder approach; Sustainability","bioenergy; capitalism; decision making; developing world; environmental justice; political economy; socialism; stakeholder; sustainability; India; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070235260

In the USA, poor adherence is estimated to cause 125,000 deaths and cost $US100 billion annually. The most successful adherence-promoting strategies that have been identified so far have moderate effect, are relatively costly, and raise availability, feasibility, and/or scalability issues. Objective: The main objective of SIGMA (Study on Incentives for Glaucoma Medication Adherence) was to measure the effectiveness on medication adherence of a novel incentive strategy based on behavioral economics that we refer to as adherence-contingent rebates. These rebates offered patients a near-term benefit while leveraging loss aversion and regret and increasing the salience of adherence. Methods: SIGMA is a 6-month randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center superiority trial with two parallel arms. A total of 100 non-adherent glaucoma patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre were randomized into intervention (adherence-contingent rebates) and usual care (no rebates) arms in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in percentage of adherent days at Month 6. The trial registration number is NCT02271269 and a detailed study protocol has been published elsewhere. Findings: We found that participants who were offered adherence-contingent rebates were adherent to all their medications on 73.1% of the days after 6 months, which is 12.2 percentage points (p = 0.027) higher than in those not receiving the rebates after controlling for baseline differences. This better behavioral outcome was achieved by rebates averaging 8.07 Singapore dollars ($US5.94 as of 2 November 2017) per month during the intervention period. Conclusion: This study shows that simultaneously leveraging several insights from behavioral economics can significantly improve medication adherence rates. The relatively low cost of the rebates and significant health and cost implications of medication non-adherence suggest that this strategy has the potential to cost-effectively improve health outcomes for many conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"antiglaucoma agent; eye drops; adherence contingent rebate; adult; aged; Article; behavioral economics; chronic disease; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; female; glaucoma; human; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; open study; parallel design; patient compliance; randomized controlled trial; reimbursement; treatment duration; very elderly; chronic disease; economics; glaucoma; middle aged; reimbursement; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Drug Therapy; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Reimbursement, Incentive; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069429445

Drawing on the sustainability, supplier relationship management, and stakeholder literature, this research examines the relationship between emerging economy sourcing, the use of purchasing teams, and the impact on enforcement of supplier social practices, and firm financial performance. Using data from a survey and archival sources from a sample of large U.S. firms, findings confirm the mediated role of the use of purchasing teams resulting in better enforcement of supplier social practices and improved firm performance. Findings also provide important implications for supply chain and purchasing executives. While the results of this research demonstrate the performance benefits of sourcing from emerging economies, findings also suggest that organizations should make investments to support capabilities related to enforcement of supplier social practices.

Then, the authors investigate how entrants modify their firm boundaries, after entering a new industry, to acquire the R&Cs deemed critical to be competitive and survive in the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis uses the global biofuel industry as a case study. The authors use multiple sets of data, including primary data collected from semi-structured interviews with industry stakeholders and experts across major biofuel-producing countries as well as quantitative data from industry reports. Findings: Firms typically deploy two successive strategies in order to survive and grow. First, they extend vertical boundaries to capitalize on their own pre-entry R&Cs. Then they move quickly to acquire new R&Cs, which are classified as critical in the value chain of the industry. A new taxonomy of pre-entry R&Cs is proposed to distinguish critical and non-critical forms of R&Cs, and to reflect the ease of acquisition of any requisite R&Cs, which are context specific. These strategic moves lead to the bi-directional vertical integration observed in the biofuel industry. Research limitations/implications: Managers need to be able to assess the opportunities for entry and subsequent strategies to be competitive by assessing their R&Cs in terms of criticality and ease of acquisition in their entry decision making. Originality/value: A new taxonomy of R&Cs of the firm is proposed which has theoretical significance and practical implications for new entrants. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Biofuels; Firm entry and exit; Industry evolution; Pre-entry experience; Resource-based view; Vertical firm structure","Decision making; Taxonomies; Design/methodology/approach; Firm entry and exit; Industry evolution; Industry stakeholders; Pre-entry experience; Resource-based view; Resources and capabilities; Semi structured interviews; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074568190

Periods in which firms find it relatively easy to borrow are followed by periods in which banks scrutinize borrowers more and tighten lending. We predict that changes in lending standards affect the accounting conservatism of bank-dependent firms. Using (i) a natural experiment that leads to certain banks tightening lending standards for plausibly exogenous reasons and (ii) time series variation in economy-wide bank lending standards, we find that borrowers increase their asymmetric timely loss recognition in response to the tightening of lending standards. Further, riskier borrowers, borrowers less likely to violate loan covenants, and borrowers whose banks tighten lending standards to a greater extent display larger increases in conservatism following the tightening of lending standards. These results suggest that borrowers internalize the costs and benefits of increasing conservatism. Finally, borrowers do not seem to decrease conservatism immediately after the lending standards are loosened. Overall, our results illuminate a commonly observed banking phenomenon that can influence firms’ incentives to recognize losses, suggesting that developments in the banking sector can shape the information produced by firms in the real sector. © 2018 INFORMS.","Accounting conservatism; Bank lending; Bank monitoring; Financial crises; Lending standards","Management; Operations research; Accounting conservatism; Bank lending; Banking sectors; Costs and benefits; Financial crisis; Natural experiment; Time series variations; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075393412

The firm's production is subject to random yield and the retailer faces uncertain demand. There exists a secondary market for the firm to acquire or dispose of products. We study the effects of yield randomness on optimal decisions and the expected profit in the cost structure, on the condition that the unit prices of the secondary emergency purchase and sale are random functions of the yield. Using the theory of stochastic comparisons, our key findings are as follows. (a) When the unit price of secondary emergency purchase is nonincreasing with the yield realization, a stochastically larger yield rate leads to a higher expected profit for both supply cases. Moreover, for the multiplicative supply case, a stochastically larger yield rate results in a lower optimal sale price, but this is not true in the additive supply case. Numerical examples show that the effect of the yield rate on the optimal order quantity is uncertain for two supply cases. (b) When the unit price of secondary emergency purchase is nonincreasing convexly with the yield realization, a less variable yield rate leads to a higher expected profit for both supply cases. Numerical examples illustrate that the effects of the yield rate on the optimal sale price and the optimal order quantity are also uncertain. (c) Based on graphical comparisons, we find that the effect of yield randomness has a more significant impact on supply chain performance with a yield-dependent secondary market price than that with a constant secondary market price. © 2017 The Authors.

However, the impact of PQRS on physicians is unclear, particularly as related to their online reputation. Is there an association between a physician’s online reputation and her adherence to clinical guidelines stipulated in the PQRS? Is online reputation associated with use of electronic health records (EHR)? To investigate these questions, we combine data on online physician reviews with the PQRS data on clinical guideline adherence and EHR use. Unlike prior research, which primarily uses clinical outcomes as proxies for care quality, our study uses adherence to clinical guidelines, a process measure that reflects physician conformance with evidence-based clinical practices. In addition, we focus on EHR use at the physician level, in contrast to the usual approach of examining it at the aggregate institutional level. Consistent with the economic theory of credence goods, we observe no significant relationship between physicians’ adherence to clinical guidelines and their online reviews. Although there is some evidence of association between EHR use and their overall rating, similar relationships are not consistently observed for individual dimensional ratings. Overall, the online reputation of a physician exhibits minimal association with her actual clinical activities — and is mostly driven by latent topics in the textual reviews — implying that the ability of online reviews to inform prospective patients of care quality might be quite limited. Therefore, patients should be cautious when using online physician reviews, and policymakers should increase the accessibility of PQRS and other similar data to help patients make informed physician choices. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","clinical guidelines; credence goods; electronic health record; online eWoM; online physician reviews; physician quality reporting","Economics; eHealth; Health insurance; Records management; Clinical guideline; credence goods; Electronic health record; online eWoM; physician quality reporting; Clinical research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073516358

(2013) to assess cyber-risk in IT firms, where this quantity is usually a joint distribution of multiple risk (random) variables (e.g., quality of antivirus, frequency of monitoring, etc.) coming from heterogeneous distribution families. As a major modeling drawback, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2013) assume that any pair of random variables in the BN are linearly correlated with each other. This simplistic assumption might not always hold true for general IT organizational environments. Thus, the use of the C-VA model in general will result in loose estimates of correlated IT risk and will subsequently affect cyber-insurance companies in framing profitable coverage policies for IT organizations. To this end, we propose methods to (1) find a closed-form expression for the maximal correlation arising between pairs of discrete random variables, whose value finds importance in getting robust estimates of copula-induced computations of organizational cyber-risk, and (2) arrive at a computationally effective mechanism to compute nonlinear correlations among pairs of discrete random variables in the correlation matrix of the CBBN model (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2013). We also prove that an empirical computation of MC using our method converges rapidly, that is, exponentially fast, to the true correlation value in the number of samples. Our proposed method contributes to a tighter estimate of IT cyber-risk under environments of low-risk data availability and will enable insurers to better assess organizational risks and subsequently underwrite profitable cyber-insurance policies. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","AI; Bayesian network; Copula; Correlation; IT cyber-risk; Sampling","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Computer viruses; Correlation methods; Insurance; Profitability; Random variables; Risk perception; Sampling; Closed-form expression; Copula; Discrete random variables; Effective mechanisms; Empirical computation; Heterogeneous distributions; Maximal correlation; Non-linear correlations; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075625941

When creating mission-critical business applications through web service compositions, in addition to ensuring that functional requirements are met, designers need to consider the end-to-end reliability, security, performance, and overall cost of the application. As the number of available coarse-grain business services grows, the problem of selecting appropriate services quickly becomes combinatorially explosive for realistic-sized business applications. This article develops a business-process-driven approach for composing service-oriented applications. We use a combination of weights to explore the entire QoS criteria landscape through the use of a multi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA) to identify a Pareto-optimal multidimensional frontier that permits managers to trade off conflicting objectives when selecting a set of services. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a real-world drop-ship business application and compare its performance to another GA-based approach for service composition. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Multiple criteria decision making; Service-oriented applications","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Quality of service; Websites; Business application systems; Conflicting objectives; End-to-end reliabilities; Evolutionary heuristics; Functional requirement; Multiple criteria decision making; Service oriented application; Web service composition; Web services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075618130

Contagious switching (or a positive network effect) can be driven by information-based social learning, as well as other mechanisms related to network size. Although previous marketing literature has documented the social-learning effect, most of the applications studied involve products in which consumers usually do not enjoy any direct benefits from a large network other than from information-based social learning. We explore the importance of the social-learning effect relative to other mechanisms that may also lead to the network effect. We propose a dynamic structural model with interpersonal interactions. To model the social-learning effect, a consumer uses feedback from his or her contacts who have switched from a focal carrier to update his or her quality expectations of alternative carriers. Our model further accounts for two unique aspects of consumer strategic learning: (i) the individual’s perception on the signal of alternative carriers from contacts who switch is systematically different according to whether the signal comes from a loyal contact; and (ii) that the perceived noisiness of the signal on alternative carriers from a contact who has switched depends on the strength of the relationship between the individual and the contact. The remaining network effect not captured through social learning is modeled as a function of the size of the network. We solve the model with a two-step dynamic programming algorithm, with the assumption that a consumer is forward-looking and decides whether to stay with the same service carrier in each period by maximizing the total utility received from that day onward. We apply the proposed model to the data set of a mobile network operator in a European country. We find that churning/switching behavior is contagious in the network context and that one-third of general network effects can be attributed to social learning. We also detect strategic learning by consumers from their contacts in two ways: the experience signal on alternative carriers from a more loyal contact who has switched from the focal carrier is perceived to be more positive than that from a less loyal contact; and the social-learning effect is stronger from an individual’s closest contacts. The simulation analysis demonstrates the value of our model in helping a company prioritize its customer relationship management effort. © 2019 INFORMS","Contagious switching behavior; Customer relationship management; Network effect; Social learning","Consumer behavior; Dynamic programming; Dynamics; Learning systems; Public relations; Switching; Customer relationship management; European Countries; Mobile network operators; Network effects; Simulation analysis; Social learning; Structural modeling; Switching behaviors; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075348945

This study examines tradeoffs between allowing current fishing mortality levels to continue versus adopting fishing mortality levels that are intended to maximize either yield or profitability in Japanese fisheries. Because stock status estimates exist for only 37 stocks in Japan, a data-limited model is used to estimate the maximum sustainable yield-based (MSY) reference points for 95 commercially exploited fish stocks using landing data from 1964 to 2015, representing 84% of Japanese landings. Future catch, biomass, and profits are simulated under two policy scenarios: (1) catch at MSY and (2) an economically optimal policy that seeks to maximize profits given the biomass level projected in each year. These scenarios were compared to a business-as-usual scenario in which current fishing mortality rates are maintained into the future. The results suggest that adopting an economically optimal fishery policy could reduce catches over the next two decades, but increase the total annual profits by 3.5-fold and biomass levels by 30% by 2065 compared with the business-as-usual scenario. In comparison, managing for MSY would require less of a short-term decrease in catch, but ultimately result in much lower profits. While these simulations do not account for real-world constraints that may limit implementation of these alternative policies, this analysis is important because it illustrates the tradeoffs and potential fishery upsides possible through fishery management reforms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioeconomic policy simulation; Data-limited stock assessment; Fisheries management; MSY-based management","fishery economics; fishery management; fishery policy; policy analysis; policy approach; policy implementation; policy reform; profitability; stock assessment; sustainability; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070699716

After extracting a large feature set from this network, we find that each feature poorly correlates with the default status. Hence, we develop a sophisticated model to enable reliable predictions. Our main contribution is a methodology for building complex behavior models from very large sets of diverse features and using different methods to choose those features that perform best for the final model. This approach enables us to identify the most efficient features for our problem which, unexpectedly, are based on the number of unique users with whom the given user communicates around the Christmas and New Year's Eve holidays.

This means that changes in the way in which time is allocated between market and home production affect measured growth and productivity, as well as economic welfare. Just as technological innovation in domestic appliances led to a substitution from home production into market consumption in the second half of the 20th century, today's digital innovations are driving some reverse substitution out of the market into home production.

In this paper, we consider aspects of productive efficiency using an Australian business population data set. Using a production function approach, several key findings are uncovered. Firstly, decreasing returns to scale are identified as a significant feature of the Australian business sector. This implies that not all firm growth will lead to productivity gains. Secondly, there are significant differences in the way value added is created between small and large firms. In the largest 25% of firms, the capital contribution to value added is four times that of the smallest 25% of firms. Thirdly, efficiency follows an inverted ‘U’ shaped in firm age with the youngest (0–2 years) and oldest (> 9 years) firms being less productive than the middle 50% of firms. Fourthly, there are also huge industry sector variations in productivity. In particular, financial services appears to be the most productively efficient sector in the Australian economy and mining the least efficient. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Capital and labour effects; Firm age; Firm size; Productivity; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048872180

Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out a cross-sector survey with 135 practitioners from different Brazilian manufacturers that have been implementing LP for at least five years. Collected data were analyzed based on multivariate techniques. Findings: The results show how different combinations between practitioners’ LP experience and generational characteristics may entail a higher likelihood of adopting LP principles. While members from generation X do not seem to be associated with the adoption of LP principles, the ones from generations Y and Z are differently related with LP based upon their experience levels. Originality/value: The understanding of individual differences for adopting LP principles allows the establishment of proper expectations with respect to each practitioner’s openness to change. Studies that address the adoption level of LP principles based on certain individual characteristics, such as practitioners’ experience with lean implementation and their generational values and beliefs, are scarce in the literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Generational differences; Lean principles; Lean production","Decision support systems; Management; Design/methodology/approach; Generational differences; Individual characteristics; Individual Differences; Lean implementation; Lean principles; Lean production principles; Multivariate techniques; Lean production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073680088

However, the resulting models tend to be computationally challenging. A reasonable number of samples needs to be identified to represent the random data, and a group of approximate models can then be constructed using such a number of samples. These approximate models can produce a set of potential solutions for the original model. In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating a finite computational budget among numerous potential solutions of a two-stage linear stochastic program, which aims to identify the best solution among potential ones by conducting simulation under a given computational budget. We propose a two-stage heuristic approach to solve the computational resource allocation problem. First, we utilise a Wasserstein-based screening rule to remove potentially inferior solutions from the simulation. Next, we use a ranking and selection technique to efficiently collect performance information of the remaining solutions. The performance of our approach is demonstrated through well-known benchmark problems. Results show that our method provides good trade-offs between computational effort and solution performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ranking and selection; Sample average approximation; Stochastic programming; Wasserstein metric","Benchmarking; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Heuristic methods; Stochastic programming; Computational budget; Computational effort; Computational resources; Linear stochastic programs; Ranking and selection; Sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programs; Wasserstein metric; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064084312

However, these measures do not characterize the dynamic component of investor activity, nor do they consider the time horizons over which weights are changed. In this paper, we propose a technique to measure the value of active investment that captures both the static and dynamic contributions of an investment process. This dynamic alpha is based on the decomposition of a portfolio’s expected return into its frequency components using spectral analysis. The result is a static component that measures the portion of a portfolio’s expected return resulting from passive investments and security selection and a dynamic component that captures the manager’s timing ability across a range of time horizons. Our framework can be universally applied to any portfolio and is a useful method for comparing the forecast power of different investment processes. Several analytical and empirical examples are provided to illustrate the practical relevance of this decomposition.

We present a novel application of a closed-loop supply chain where product returns from demonstrations of high-end IT equipment are substantial and the major delay in the system is due to the long demonstration time at the client sites. In addition, the product lifecycle is short and the value erodes rapidly over time, with steep drops in the resale revenue when new product generations are introduced. We present a finite lifecycle model that captures the key trade-offs in this environment, that is, either to reuse a collected ex-demo product for a next demonstration or to salvage its residual value in the secondary market and use a new product to satisfy the next demo request. We derive two cost/revenue signals that enable us to distinguish between fast and slow value erosion. We show that the fast/slow erosion decision is dynamic and depends on the rate of value erosion and the length of the demonstration time. We analyze the optimal demo pool strategies and show that in the case of fast erosion it may be better to postpone reuse activities until later in the lifecycle. We illustrate our model using empirical data from a large IT manufacturer and formulate several guidelines so as to better manage high value ex-demonstration product returns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous time transportation problem application; Ex-demonstration product returns; Reuse closed-loop supply chains; Supply Chain Management; Time-sensitivity","Commerce; Continuous time systems; Demonstrations; Economic and social effects; Erosion; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chain management; Closed-loop supply chain; Novel applications; Product generation; Product returns; Product-life-cycle; Secondary market; Time sensitivity; Transportation problem; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062425679

Moreover, the strength of the job satisfaction-employee incivility linkage varies depending on levels of organizational formalization (hard-coercive tactics).

The proposed method relies on an effective Finite Mixture of Regressions technique based on competitive learning for carrying out the model-based clustering with ‘must-link’ constraints and modeling store performance. We also propose an optimization framework to derive tailored recommendations for individual dealerships within store clusters that jointly improves profitability for the store while also improving sales to satisfy manufacturer requirements.

In this study, we first review the measures of effectiveness used in current gate reassignment approaches. Afterwards, we perform a set of preliminary experiments to demonstrate the main features of the model and verify its sensitivity to input changes. Then, we apply it in a real case study, where we examine the interaction of measures of effectiveness and investigate the impact of our proposed way of modeling missed connections on the optimal solution. Our results demonstrate the necessity of considering passenger connections in the optimization procedure since they contribute significantly to the total solution cost. We also show that, except for extreme cases (negligible disruptions or high delays within the airport), considering gate location yields different results than simply assuming that a fixed time threshold is sufficient for all connections. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gate reassignment; Integer programming; Measures of effectiveness; Passenger connections","air transportation; aircraft; airport; numerical model; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060184936

Specifically, we study a newsvendor model where the supplier offers a trade credit contract to the retailer who, by delaying the payment, can invest the accounts payable amount and earn returns. We find that when the channel partners have symmetric information about the retailer's investment return, a conditionally concessional trade credit (CTC) contract, which includes a wholesale price, an interest-free period, and a minimum order requirement, can achieve channel coordination.

There is a body of literature in time-series analysis that focuses on improving the prediction when a change in the trend is observed. Following this line of literature, a method was recently proposed that outperforms the previous proposals. To utilize this method for prediction of disease counts, the present study employs a commonly used method called local estimators for estimation near boundaries. This provides two advantages for disease count prediction. First, the prior method is limited to only smooth trend changes. However, the current study using local estimators also encounters abrupt changes. Taking both smooth and abrupt changes into account is important in predicting disease counts, because, for variety of different reasons, such as vaccination programs, the disease counts may encounter abrupt changes. Second, the current study, despite the previous approach, can also model uncertainty. The parameter uncertainty plays a significant role when predicting disease counts. Compared to current literature, the proposed method outperformed to predict counts for 12 diseases in Nevada. The paper demonstrates that the proposed methods improved the prediction Q-Score in comparison to both outbreak and structural change methods available in literature. Although this method has been specifically demonstrated for prediction of disease counts, it can be generalized for different applications. With the recent utilization of analytics techniques and the increased use of time-series analysis in information systems, the suggested method provides implications for the literature of information systems when predicting with structural trend changes in data. © 2018","Disease counts; Structural trend change; Time-series analysis","Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Information systems; Information use; Molecular physics; Structural analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Model uncertainties; Parameter uncertainty; Structural trends; Time series prediction; Time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059691925

A model comprises a vector of random input factors, an aggregation function mapping input factors to a random output, and a (baseline) probability measure. A risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, maps the distribution of the output to the real line. As is common in risk management, the value of the risk measure applied to the output is a decision variable. Therefore, it is of interest to associate a critical increase in the risk measure to specific input factors. We propose a global and model-independent framework, termed ‘reverse sensitivity testing’, comprising three steps: (a) an output stress is specified, corresponding to an increase in the risk measure(s); (b) a (stressed) probability measure is derived, minimising the Kullback–Leibler divergence with respect to the baseline probability, under constraints generated by the output stress; (c) changes in the distributions of input factors are evaluated. We argue that a substantial change in the distribution of an input factor corresponds to high sensitivity to that input and introduce a novel sensitivity measure to formalise this insight. Implementation of reverse sensitivity testing in a Monte Carlo setting can be performed on a single set of input/output scenarios, simulated under the baseline model. Thus the approach circumvents the need for additional computationally expensive evaluations of the aggregation function. We illustrate the proposed approach through numerical examples with a simple insurance portfolio and a model of a London Insurance Market portfolio used in industry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Expected Shortfall; Risk management; Robustness and sensitivity analysis; Stress testing; Value-at-Risk","Decision making; Probability distributions; Risk management; Sensitivity analysis; Value engineering; Aggregation functions; Decision variables; Expected shortfall; Probability measures; Robustness and sensitivity analysis; Sensitivity measures; Stress Testing; Value at Risk; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055571383

With an increasing transportation demand, the traffic safety needs to be improved in order to reduce the crash rates and the exposure of the population to crash-prone regions. This paper aims to conduct a spatiotemporal analysis to quantify the exposure of population to crash-prone locations focusing on different age groups, and to statistically analyze the decision-making process for possible improvement. For this purpose, first, the crash-prone locations for different population age groups and various time intervals of a day were identified by using a geographic information system (GIS) hotspot analysis. This was followed by an Origin-Destination (OD) analysis applied on a case study in Tampa Bay region (Florida, District 7) to calculate the roadway network-based travel times between census blocks centroids (origins) and crash hotspot locations (destinations) along the least-cost roadways. Later, the results were utilized in an exceedance probability analysis to simplify the decision-making process for improvement. The results showed that the time-based analysis provides more accurate and detailed information than the distance-based analysis. The Weighted Hotspot Exposure Measure parameter introduced for statistical analysis showed that the senior age group (over 65 years old) are more exposed to the risk of being injured in a crash compared to other age groups. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crash hotspots; Geographic information systems; Public safety; Spatiotemporal analysis","decision making; GIS; injury; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation safety; Florida [United States]; Tampa Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061548506

This research uses an original design for consensus-building workshops to identify and prioritize 23 market entry decision factors collected from the literature and from experiential knowledge of over 130 industry experts. The industry consensus resulting from the workshops leads to the identification of decision factors for four types of market entry. Data analysis reveals that the following eight essential factors are always important regardless of the market entry decision type: competition in the market, competitive advantage, strategic fit, experience and abilities of the champion, investment capital, market need, profit projections, and start-up costs. The workshop design developed for this study represents an original and simple approach for synthesizing the experience and practical knowledge of several industry experts. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying for the first time the eight most important factors for engineering and construction firms to consider when assessing a new, domestic market entry. Working independently, only 2 out of 108 individuals identified the top two most important factors to market entry success, indicating that the industry's collective knowledge is not as obvious to individuals making market entry decisions, and further highlighting the contribution of this paper. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Codes (symbols); Competition; Construction industry; Investments; Sheet metal; Collective knowledge; Competitive advantage; Consensus buildings; Construction firms; Engineering and construction firms; Experiential knowledge; Industry consensus; Investment capital; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059571604

Indications as to the supply side mechanisms involved can be found in some pro-Brexit writings and speeches and revolve around cutting regulation and reducing taxation, to spur innovation entrepreneurship. The authors contend that these measures align to a broad set of policy measures associated with Economic Shock Therapy, the Laffer Curve and the associated “Washington Consensus” (Williamson, 2005). The authors are looking to stimulate a conversation around whether these measures are most likely to stimulate entrepreneurial innovation and growth. The authors open by contrasting these concepts to growth equilibrium dynamics drawn from Wicksell, Keynes and Schumpeter – and by implication dynamic Walrasian General Equilibrium – to pose the question, is entrepreneur-led growth best led via slashing regulations and taxes or by focussing on correcting existing market failures? The purpose of this paper is to promote controversy and debate as to which “supply side measures” are most effective in enabling entrepreneurial growth. Design/methodology/approach: The authors briefly review the pro-Brexiteer economic framework and relate this to broader Economic Shock Therapy and Laffer Curve concepts; how these have been applied and how some argue they can become “supply side” enablers in a positive Brexit innovation and entrepreneurship transformation. By drawing upon fundamental economic relationships such as Wicksell’s (1898) “Natural Rate of Interest”, the authors highlight the importance of information asymmetry and regulatory distortion in financial markets, resulting in some entrepreneurs (and associated innovations) failing to receive the capital their project merit. The authors pose the question, whether Shock Therapy, Laffer Curve type tax cuts and any Brexit “bonfire of regulation” will raise entrepreneurial growth and success. Findings: Both Shock Therapy and Laffer Curve inspired tax cuts have a patchy record of success, despite notable achievements in post-1991 Poland. The authors stress entrepreneurs drive innovation and growth, and a key support to them requires correcting “access to finance” market failures. It is questionable if Economic Shocks contribute anything to resolving this fundamental problem. Originality/value: The authors open the supply side debate on anticipated “Brexit Transformation” in the context of long standing (some maybe long forgotten) theoretical understandings, thereby posing the question as to whether potential Brexit-related deregulation, tax cuts and “Economic Shock” therapy are likely to raise entrepreneurial competitive advantage and success rates. Market failure in financial market support for small firm growth and innovation needs are highlighted. Arguably, economic growth and innovation would be better sustained by addressing these failures, than introducing the “unknowns” and risks associated with a substantial Economic Shock. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Entrepreneurs; Financing; International entrepreneurship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059665084

This is because they are places where research outcomes that may lead to radical or disruptive changes to practice are produced. Cognisant of this, and its implications for economic development, policy-makers conferred ownership of research outcomes to universities as a means of facilitating commercialisation. This paper, alongside a growing body of literature, questions the prevailing property rights regime, positing that it is sub-optimal in terms of reducing societal benefits coming from commercialisation. More specifically, drawing on the experience of Greater Manchester (England), this paper argues that university ownership implications on the availability of information used in commercialisation decisions. The detachment of entrepreneurs, a direct consequence of property rights, in the transition from disclosure to patenting means that it is not the transfer of technical information (as suggested in the literature) that constitutes the main challenge. Instead, this paper suggests it is ‘unknowledge’ i.e. information that has yet to be generated in the introduction of something new that impacts commercialisation. The paper suggests that, rather paradoxically, entrepreneurial engagement may be best attained. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Commercialisation; Entrepreneurship; Information; Property rights; Uncertainty; University","Competition; Commercialisation; Entrepreneurship; Information; Property right; Uncertainty; University; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030661113

It offers flexibility by including many different types of tickets but it can also cause confusion, which may lead some to a negative view towards rail travel and thereby potentially inhibit demand, in comparison to a simpler fare regime. This study used an innovative stated preference survey to quantify the demand effects of fare complexity, focusing on Advance tickets (those that are restricted to a particular train service). The choice experiment was designed to mirror very closely the actual booking experience when buying tickets online, in all its complexity. Participants could choose among up to 531 different ticket type combinations for the outward and return legs of a trip and from up to 25 possible train services for each leg. The key design attribute was complexity, defined as the range of different Advance tickets on offer. The survey was applied to a sample of 1027 users and 179 non-users of the rail network on the London-Leeds route. The modelling of the choices with a nested mixed logit model suggested that, all else equal, reducing complexity by removing Advance tickets would lead to a substantial reduction of demand (11 to 45%, depending on route segment). Equalizing the price of Advance tickets for all train services was predicted to cause a smaller reduction (3–6%). By contrast, increasing complexity by adding new Flexible Advance tickets (valid on the services immediately before or after the chosen service) would increase demand by 4–15%. These findings run counter to the hypothesis that simplifying the fare structure would lead to increases in demand for rail travel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fare complexity; Fare simplification; Interurban travel; Rail demand; Rail pricing; Stated preference","Logistic regression; Railroad transportation; Surveys; Choice experiments; Fare complexity; Fare simplification; Interurban travel; Mixed logit models; Stated preference surveys; Stated preferences; Substantial reduction; Complex networks; complexity; contingent valuation; pricing policy; railway transport; transportation economics; travel demand; urban transport; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059347972

The impacts of the emergency relief facilities (ERFs) and the distribution channels between the facilities are evaluated and quantified concerning the efficiency and robustness. A case study using historical data in South Carolina is analysed with the framework. We identify that GP-DEA framework optimizes and evaluates DRSC layouts without any subjective judgment from decision-makers. Further, we also identify that the performance of DRSC layouts is the most significantly determined by the distribution channels.

The stockist purchases product from the manufacturer, develops retailer interest in carrying the product, solves the logistics problem of delivery to retailers, and manages retail credit and money collection. In return, the stockist is provided assistance by the manufacturer and paid an associated margin that is a percent of the product’s retail price. We observed relatively low distribution margins offered to the stockists in India that was a surprise given infrastructure and financing challenges. We noted that the low margins are enabled by the efficiency in product delivery and demand stimulation induced by the stockist. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of screening contracts offered by manufacturers to stockists. Methodology: We use a principal–agent model structure and model the routing cost, inventory cost, and demand impact of the stockist’s capability. We then use a substitutes or complements relationship between manufacturer assistance and stockist impact to understand the optimal contract structure—i.e., level of assistance and associated retail margin. We describe the economics associated with the stockist, provide data regarding the margins and assistance provided by the manufacturer, and use the model to understand their use in developing an effective supply chain. Results: Our model uses three parameters to show that a manufacture can adjust the level of spatial retailer intensity and thus the impact of the stockist in generating demand, the fraction of high-performing stockists associated with the manufacturer and the nature of the relationship between assistance provided and its impact on the stockist’s performance (i.e., complements or substitutes relationship), to attain superior performance. Academic/practical relevance: We parameterize data from Indian firms in the consumer goods industry to understand the observed assistance provided by the manufacturer to the stockist, and associated margins. We then use our model to understand actions taken by a manufacturer in the Indian market. Managerial implications: Our analysis provides a framework for manufacturers to design screening contracts for stockists who play a vital role in managing the fragmented retail markets in developing countries. © 2019 INFORMS","Distribution; Margins; Principal–agent model; Retailer; Stockist","Commerce; Developing countries; Manufacture; Structural optimization; Supply chains; Agent model; Distribution; Margins; Retailer; Stockist; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068916924

In the United States alone, two million people are infected, and 23,000 die each year from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In many cases, infections are resistant to all but a few remaining drugs. We examine the case in which a single drug remains and solve for the optimal treatment policy for a susceptible–infected–susceptible infectious disease model, incorporating the effects of drug resistance. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with two continuous state variables: the disease prevalence and drug’s “quality” (the fraction of infections that are drug-susceptible). The decision maker’s objective is to minimize the discounted cost of the disease to society over an infinite horizon. We provide a new generalizable solution approach that allows us to thoroughly characterize the optimal treatment policy analytically. We prove that the optimal treatment policy is a bang-bang policy with a single switching time. The action/inaction regions can be described by a single boundary that is strictly increasing when viewed as a function of drug quality, indicating that, when the disease transmission rate is constant, the policy of withholding treatment to preserve the drug for a potentially more serious future outbreak is not optimal. We show that the optimal value function and/or its derivatives are neither C1 nor Lipschitz continuous, suggesting that numerical approaches to this family of dynamic infectious disease models may not be computationally stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relaxing the standard assumption of a constant disease transmission rate can fundamentally change the shape of the action region, add a singular arc to the optimal control, and make preserving the drug for a serious outbreak optimal. In addition, we apply our framework to the case of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. © 2019 INFORMS.","Antimicrobial resistance; Dynamic health policy; Healthcare management; Infectious disease models; Optimal control","Antibiotics; Controlled drug delivery; Decision making; Disease control; Health risks; Microorganisms; Optimal control systems; Quality control; Antimicrobial resistances; Health policy; Health-care managements; Infectious disease models; Optimal controls; Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068486498

What began as a manual pilot project in 2005 has grown into an automated inventory planning process encompassing all forward-staged inventory points in Intel's global distribution network. Key elements in the change transformation include the automatic removal of forecast bias and forecasting based on similar past products. Pivotal to the transformation was first piloting the multiechelon inventory optimization (MEIO) within the existing business process, enabling supply planners to be able to see how MEIO would have been an improvement over their ad hoc approach and tracking the reasons for their system overrides. The resulting inventory models are run weekly, and over 99.5% of each week's inventory targets are accepted automatically by the supply planning community. For the four-year period spanning 2014-2017, Intel's finance organization credits the deployment of MEIOwith increasing Intel's gross profits by over .3 billion. As of this writing in 2018, this lights-out process manages approximately 85% of all finished-goods inventory.

The aim of this study is to compare three multi-site models, i.e. hidden Markov model (HMM), non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM), and K-nearest neighbor model (KNN) in stochastic generation of rainfall data over a network consisting of 130 synoptic stations across Iran using 20-year (1991–2010) daily dataset. Regarding the NHMM, the hidden layer parameters were considered time dependent, such that a layer including predictors was added to HMM. General circulation model (GCM) outputs could be selected as the elements of this layer or predictors. A principle component analysis (PCA) was implemented on four standardized variables of HADGEM2 model (pressure, geo-potential height, temperature, and specific humidity) for historical period on 29 grids across Iran. Accordingly, pressure variable has been selected as a predictor layer in the NHMM according to Bayesian Information criteria (BIC). Results showed that the NHMM has a significant lower BIC compared to the HMM, which confirms the time-dependence assumption of Markov transition probabilities. In stochastic generation process by NHMM and KNN models, different criteria such as seasonal mean and variance, empirical distribution of daily precipitation data in winter, probabilities of wet and dry spells in various sequences and spatial dependency have been compared. According to the results, the NHMM had a significantly better performance compared to KNN model. Nevertheless, no model was able to precisely generate rainfall based on all the evaluation criteria. Log-odds ratio as the spatial correlation criterion illustrated that both NHMM and KNN have promising results in reconstructing spatial relationships. Therefore, both models could be considered as multi-site approaches with a good skill in keeping spatiotemporally changing parameters. The findings of this study may improve the seasonal predictability of rainfall characteristics across the country. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","KNN; Log-odds ratio; NHMM; Spatiotemporal modeling; Weather generators","comparative study; diurnal variation; nearest neighbor analysis; numerical model; rainfall; spatiotemporal analysis; stochasticity; weather; winter; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084568315

We use an institution-based approach to propose that increases in international dispersion lead, on average, to profitability downturns. We also argue that this liability of foreignness will affect multinationals from infrastructure industries to a lesser extent because in these industries: (1) the importance of cultural fit in products is low; (2) firms possess regulatory expertise; and (3) firms have limited aggregation opportunities at the regional level. We test our hypotheses on a panel of Spanish listed firms (1986–2007).

Using a unique approach that pairs Utah residential real estate data with church congregation boundaries, we find that affiliations enable real estate agents to list 14% more expensive homes, and to consequently build reputation useful for future nonaffiliated transactions. We observe large reputation-building benefits for early-career agents, particularly for agents in low-reputation firms. Strikingly, we find this lowers entrepreneurship entry by 6%. These results imply that social affiliations can substitute for reputation in selection, enabling professionals to build reputation, which then has important career implications. Managerial summary: This article explores how social relationships between real estate agents and home sellers influence the value of transactions agents engage in. Sellers increasingly trust agents with whom they share a social affiliation, which allows agents to better secure high-value listings and build reputation. This benefits agent in securing future valuable transactions with nonaffiliated clients. Using residential real estate data and geographically assigned church congregations, we find that agents list 14% more expensive homes when listing for affiliated clients, and that this builds agent reputation significantly faster than listing for nonaffiliated clients. Interestingly, we find listing for affiliated clients reduces future entrepreneurship 6%. Our study suggests that service professionals can leverage social affiliations to build reputation that helps them establish clientele and improve performance. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","entrepreneurship; human capital; professional services; reputation; social capital","Management; Planning; entrepreneurship; Human capitals; Professional services; reputation; Social capitals; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071315430

Despite this popularity, there is a dearth of evaluation of OI efficiency and a lack of suitable quantitative indices. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors used both data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist techniques to compare the pre- and post-transition levels of performance achievement of Procter & Gamble (P&G), a widely recognised and public early adopter of OI, with a group of its main competitors. Findings: Most detailed analysis of the time-course revealed that the innovation efficiency of P&G improved rapidly and substantially after its embracing of OI, an effect we term the “open rise”. However, there is also a transient decline in R&D efficiency at the beginning of OI adoption (“open dip”) and an unexpected and marked decline (“open drop”) after the peak positive effect. Originality/value: The quantitative methods appear to meet the needs identified in the preceding literature for more quantitative approaches to the measurement of OI. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data envelopment analysis; Open innovation; Performance evaluation; Proctor & Gamble",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074339721

In addition to a standard objective of total SN cost minimisation, two new objectives are considered: minimisation of suppliers’ risk and maximisation of achievement of a manufacturer business strategy. Uncertainty in supply lead times and non-conformance rates of delivered components causes uncertainty in the SN cost objective. These parameters are described using imprecise linguistic terms and modelled using fuzzy numbers. Risk classification of suppliers is carried out using imprecise knowledge which is modelled using fuzzy If-Then rules and embedded in the risk objective. Various experiments are carried out to analyse the trade-off between the considered objectives and the impact of SN network parameters on the suppliers’ selection and order allocation. The size of the problem that the model can handle is analysed also. © 2019, © 2019 Operational Research Society.","fuzzy sets; optimisation; risk; Supply network","Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Linguistics; Risks; Strategic planning; Cost minimisation; Fuzzy if-then rules; Imprecise knowledge; Network parameters; Optimisations; Risk classification; Supplier selection; Supply networks; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060592365

Is this effect contingent on the product-market profile, that is, on whether firms operate in business or consumer markets? We use a panel dataset comprising 23,769 firm-year observations to help address these questions. We find that higher CSP has a strong negative effect on sales for business-to-consumer firms but an insignificant or economically trivial effect for business-to-business firms. However, we also find that higher CSP has a positive effect on firm value for both types of firms.

Many countries apply environmental regulations, reforms and policies for its improvement. However, the question is how the people value the environment, including the air quality. This study examines the association between air pollution and life satisfaction using the Swiss Household Panel survey over the years 2000–2013. We follow a Bayesian network (BN) strategy to estimate the causal effect of the income and air pollution on life satisfaction. We look at five main air pollutants: the ground-level ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter of 10 micrometres (PM10). Then, we calculate the individuals’ marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) of reducing air pollution that aims to improve their life satisfaction. Beside the BN model, we take advantage of the panel structure of our data and we follow two approaches as robustness check. This includes the adapted probit fixed effects and the generalised methods of moments system. Our findings show that O3 and PM10 present the highest MWTP values ranging between $8000 and $12,000, followed by the remained air pollutants with MWTP extending between $2000 and $6500. Applying the BNs, we find that the causal effect of income on life satisfaction is substantially increased. We also show the causal effects of air pollutants remain almost the same, leading to lower values of willingness to pay. © 2018, The Author(s).","Air quality; Bayesian networks; Causal inference; Directed acyclic graph; Environmental valuation; Life satisfaction","air quality; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; environmental economics; environmental values; life satisfaction; numerical model; particulate matter; willingness to pay; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048960258

While posing new challenges to effective learning, it can play a crucial role in powering meaningful scientific discoveries through the integration of information among subpopulations of interest. In this article, we exploit multiple networks with Gaussian graphs to encode the connectivity patterns of a large number of features on the subpopulations. To uncover the underlying sparsity structures across subpopulations, we suggest a framework of large-scale tuning-free heterogeneous inference, where the number of networks is allowed to diverge. In particular, two new tests, the chi-based and the linear functional-based tests, are introduced and their asymptotic null distributions are established. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish that both tests are optimal in achieving the testable region boundary and the sample size requirement for the latter test is minimal. Both theoretical guarantees and the tuning-free property stem from efficient multiple-network estimation by our newly suggested heterogeneous group square-root Lasso for high-dimensional multi-response regression with heterogeneous noises. To solve this convex program, we further introduce a scalable algorithm that enjoys provable convergence to the global optimum. Both computational and theoretical advantages are elucidated through simulation and real data examples.

However, not all of these IT products remain profitable, valuable, and strategic for a company. It is beneficial for the IT company to delete weak products from the product portfolio and re-channelize the freed resources to strong products in order to improve financial performance. Three internal factors influencing product deletion in IT companies are (1) deleting an existing product to introduce a new one; (2) deleting a relatively new product to merge it with an established product; or (3) merging multiple products into one product. Alternatively, three external factors that impact product deletion decisions in IT companies are (1) privacy concerns and issues; (2) unfavorable reviews from technology experts; or (3) mergers and acquisitions. Understanding these unique factors that trigger product deletion in IT firms can facilitate the decision-making process and aid managers in successfully implementing the product deletion. If managed appropriately, product deletions could help a company redeploy its valuable resources to strong products in the portfolio, create a superior competitive position in the market, and bolster growth and financial performance. © 1973-2011 IEEE.","Information technology industry; product deletion; product portfolio management","Decision making; Financial data processing; Investments; Competitive position; Decision making process; Financial performance; Information technology industry; product deletion; Product portfolio management; Product portfolios; Technology experts; Mergers and acquisitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073752932

Design/methodology/approach: A time-lapse evaluation model was developed to classify and estimate the impact of building demolition processes and material waste recovery. The dynamic assessment of demolition, collision and mechanical impact was measured through computerised 4D motion game and physics engines. Waste recovery and treatment complemented the simulation algorithm. The simulation of the information workflow was tested through case study using two demolition strategies. Findings: The simulation successfully estimated the efficiency and efficacy of the different demolition strategies. Thus, simulation results can potentially support better decision making related to the definition of demolition strategies associated with recycling and re-use targets. Research limitations/implications: The simulation was limited to a simple machine-led demolition strategy. Further research is required to understand the impact of complex machine mechanic movements and processes on complex building fabrics. Originality/value: Modelling and evaluating the demolition process and its impact on material waste recovery with a time dimension is novel. The comparative analysis of quantitative data allows demolition professionals to find optimal and more sustainable demolition solutions and more efficient and safer implementation on site. It also contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between demolition strategy and waste sortability.

This paper presents a procedure based on empirically determined normalized likelihoods of transition. It shows that these normalized likelihoods equate to posterior probabilities if case–control sampling is carried out among historical instances of change and persistence. The posterior probabilities can then be aggregated at the pixel level across multiple covariates using linear opinion pooling where the pixel-specific weight for each covariate is determined locally by its ability to distinguish between the alternatives of change or persistence. Thus, covariates with spatially varying diagnostic ability can be productively incorporated.

Margaret Masterman's distinction of three senses of paradigm – introduced as construct paradigm, worldview paradigm, and action paradigm – clarifies and extends these accounts to support a preliminary framework and systematic approach. Overall, this investigation expands our understanding of strategic decision-making as guided not only by analytic achievements and developmental investigations but also by discontinuous breaks that can be explored and addressed using scenario methodology.

The system rates nursing homes based on a combination of CMS's inspection results and nursing homes' self-reported measures. Prior research has shown that the rating system is subject to inflation in the self-reporting procedure, leading to biased overall ratings. Given the limited resources CMS has, it is important to optimize the inspection process and develop an effective audit process to detect and deter inflation. We first examine if the domain that CMS currently inspects is the best choice in terms of minimizing the population of nursing homes that can inflate and minimizing the difficulty of detecting such inflators. To do this, we formulate the problem mathematically and test the model by using publicly available CMS data on nursing home ratings. We show that CMS's current choice of inspection domain is not optimal if it intends to minimize the number of nursing homes that can inflate their reports, and CMS will be better off if it inspects the staffing domain instead. We also show that CMS's current choice of inspection domain is only optimal had there been an audit system in place to complement it. We then design an audit system for CMS which will be coupled with its current inspection strategy to either minimize the initial budget required to conduct the audits or to maximize the efficiency of the audit process. To design the audit system, we consider nursing homes' reactions to different audit policies, and conduct a detailed simulation study on the optimal audit parameter settings. Our result suggests that CMS should use a moderate audit policy in order to carefully balance the tradeoff between audit net budget and audit efficiency. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Audit design; Nursing homes' rating system; Rating inflation","Budget control; Efficiency; Health insurance; Hospitals; Inspection; Inspection process; Inspection strategy; Insurance companies; Nursing homes; Parameter setting; Rating system; Self-reporting; Simulation studies; Nursing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074816922

Evidence suggests that obesity reduces labor-market attachment, worker productivity, and earnings. This link at the micro level may translate into adverse effects on economic growth at the macro level. Few studies have evaluated how body mass index impacts economic growth across and within countries. This sparse evidence base reflects the lack of consistent data across a broad spectrum of countries and timespan, as well as the empirical difficulties in bypassing endogeneity bias relating to unobserved selection and potential reverse causality between bodyweight and GDP. We address both of these challenges by first assembling a comprehensive panel of data spanning 116 countries over 25 years (1984–2008), and then presenting, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of economic growth and obesiy correcting for endogeneity. Our GMM estimates indicate that, in developed countries, a higher level of BMI has direct negative effects on economic growth in a fully saturated model that controls for levels of human capital.

Results suggest the effects of rising labour costs on the supply chain are modest, and easily swamped or obscured by the effects of rising income.

This paper aims to clarify why millennials enter the healthcare management field and how their motivations correlate with preferences for working in various healthcare sectors and with various patient populations. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from 107 millennials pursuing bachelor degrees in healthcare management by using a modified version of the multidimensional work motivation scale. Further data were collected on millennials’ preferences for working in various healthcare sectors and with various patient populations. Correlational analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between types of motivation and workplace preferences. Cross-cultural differences were also examined within this generational set. Findings: Results indicate a significant positive relationship between intrinsic motivation and preferences for working on the payer side of the industry and within finance and IT functions. Findings also reveal a significant positive relationship between prosocial motivation and preferences for working with more vulnerable patient populations. Variance in work motivation among cultural sub-sets of millennials suggests different upbringings, or alternatively, cultural relativity of the motivational constructs themselves. Research limitations/implications: Despite offering key insights into the next generation of healthcare managers, this study is limited by a sample of millennials from one large, metropolitan university in the USA and thus may not represent the views of all millennials. Practical implications: To select, retain and develop the next generation of healthcare managers, it is incumbent upon organizations to better understanding millennials’ motivations and preferences. Originality/value: This study is the first of its kind to illuminate the motivations and preferences that underpin a key and growing segment of the healthcare workforce.

Among many changes and rearrangements is the introduction of the term 'engineering judgment' as one of the competencies that students must develop to prepare for professional engineering. Literature review: However, engineering judgment is not defined in the criterion, and although it is a ubiquitous concept in the philosophy of engineering and engineering education, little empirical investigation has been undertaken into the practice of engineering judgment. And there is even less conceptual or empirical investigation into communication's role in the practice of engineering judgment. Research questions: 1. What does engineering judgment look like in practice? 2. How does the sociotechnical situation affect engineering judgment? 3. What role does rhetoric have, not only in communicating judgments, but in forming them as well? 4. How can teachers and practitioners in engineering and technical communication use these findings to facilitate better judgment in the classroom and at work? Methods: Using videotape and fieldnotes, the author examines the two sequences of decision-making from a student engineering design project. An ethnomethodologically inspired framework is used to exhibit the phenomenal details of 'doing' engineering judgment. Discussion/conclusion: Data reveal that engineering judgment may be fruitfully understood by educators as not just a cognitive and individual ability to apply technical knowledge, but instead a capacity of participants to rhetorically establish common cause to interrogate and reflect on the relations between technical data and situations. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Design; embodiment; engineering judgment; rhetorical theory","Decision making; Design; embodiment; Empirical investigation; Engineering design projects; Engineering judgments; Philosophy of engineerings; Professional engineerings; rhetorical theory; Technical communications; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065997854

The cost depends on the relative ease with which those prices can be collected, and in many retail gasoline markets, there is a substantial divide in the ease of collecting information with regular grade gasoline on one side of the divide and midgrade and premium grade gasoline on the other. Regular grade prices are prominently displayed on large signboards in front of gasoline stations while the prices of higher octane grades, except where required by law, are rarely displayed. In this article, the effects of differential-by-grade price information on search and gasoline price dispersion are examined. A rank reversal test is used to test whether the observed grade-specific price dispersion is consistent with search or non-search related causes and, finding the former, a series of tests are presented to test for the effect of price information and other leading hypotheses. A significantly concave curvature in the price dispersion coefficients across the three grades supports a price information hypothesis. Detailed socioeconomic data on consumers, spatially matched to the stations they are most likely to patronize, shows that income is a secondary factor.

This study investigates the technical inefficiency of weeding labor, other labor, and overall inputs, and identifies sources of technical inefficiency of weeding labor in the context of parasitic weed infestation. The analysis applies a two-stage approach. First, a directional input distance function DEA approach was used to compute input-specific technical inefficiencies. Second, sources of technical inefficiency of weeding labor were identified using a truncated bootstrap regression. Data from 406 randomly selected smallholder farmers from Benin (n = 215) and Côte d'Ivoire (n = 191) were used. The technical inefficiency of weeding labor was high in both countries (58% in Côte d'Ivoire and 69% in Benin). This implies that a substantial fraction of weeding labor could be saved without reducing rice productivity or increasing the use of other inputs. A decrease in the technical inefficiency of weeding labor with an increase in production scale was observed. In addition, weeding regime and education level were each associated to significant changes in the technical inefficiency of weeding labor. © 2018 International Association of Agricultural Economists","Bootstrapping; C01; C02; C14; C34; Data Envelopment Analysis; Rice vampire weed; Smallholder farming; Witchweed","bootstrapping; data envelopment analysis; farming system; labor; parasite; rainfed agriculture; rice; smallholder; technical efficiency; weed; weed control; Benin [West Africa]; Cote d'Ivoire; Sub-Saharan Africa; Striga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059846488

Unconstraining methods are concerned with estimating the true demand from such constrained sales data. This paper addresses the frequently encountered situation of observing only a few sales events at the individual product level and proposes variants of small demand forecasting methods to be used for unconstraining. The usual procedure is to aggregate data; however, in that case we lose information on when restrictions were imposed or lifted within a given booking profile. Our proposed methods exploit this information and are able to approximate convex, concave or homogeneous booking curves. Furthermore, they are numerically robust due to our proposed group-based parameter optimization.

As a consequence, it is characterized by high levels of uncertainty for both producer and consumer. Yet the firms that dominate global film distribution have remained remarkably stable over the last century. The ability to transform uncertainty into risk, and to manage these risks effectively, has arguably been the outstanding achievement of major American film studios since the 1920s. This article examines how the risk management strategies of these firms have evolved over time, with a particular focus on the growing prevalence of sequels during the last 30 years. We analyse data on the box-office earnings and budgets of over 4000 films released between 1988 and 2015 and find that sequels have become an increasingly important source of industry profits since c.2000. We place this trend in historical context, and argue that while sequels themselves are not new, their role within film portfolios has changed, and that this represents a distinctive approach to risk management within the industry. © The Author(s) 2018.","Film industry; Hollywood; profitability; risk management; sequels; uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058367054

The use of scenarios is wide ranging to inform policy development and forming a business-as-usual scenario helps to understand possible effects of different policy interventions. However, the term business-as-usual is frequently misused. We show how econo-physical business-as-usual scenarios can be developed by examining the historical behaviour of coefficients which manifest the relationship between components of an economy. We endogenise economic growth by mimicking national level policies that focus on a target level of unemployment. Our case-study demonstrates the ‘trendability’ of coefficients which for one example coefficient is replicated for Australia, Colombia, Taiwan and the USA. We manifest a gross domestic product growth of 2% falling to 1% which contrasts with an exogenous growth of 2.3% of a comparator business-as-usual scenario.

Despite the advancement of prediction techniques, capital projects still suffer from overly optimistic plans, i.e. tight budgets and schedules. This article focuses on understanding this issue from the perspective of optimism bias, i.e. a psychological bias toward the inclination to be overly optimistic about the chance of success. We hypothesize that human communication network topologies are strong predictors of harmful optimism bias at the group level in project planning. A human-subject experiment was performed to test group optimism bias levels under different communication network topologies. We recruited 103 subjects to estimate the cost of an artificial power plant project. The communication networks were manipulated to reflect different topologies. The subjects’ estimates were compared to a Monte Carlo simulation result based on real historical data to quantify the level of optimism bias at the group level. Preliminary results find that certain human communication network topology leads to more realistic estimates, possibly due to a process of updating individual judgement based on peers’ judgements. The findings of this study are expected to urge further theoretical investigations into the development of simple yet effective decision support systems to reduce decision-making bias in capital project planning. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Communication network; optimism bias; project planning; topology","Budget control; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Topology; Communication network topology; Human communications; Human subject experiments; Optimism bias; Power plant projects; Prediction techniques; Project planning; Theoretical investigations; Telecommunication networks; anthropogenic effect; communication network; computer simulation; decision making; Monte Carlo analysis; project management; topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057344073

However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We conjecture that the effects of social norms are conditional on an individual’s digital social ties and provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. In our investigation of the effect of social norms on users’ goal-setting and goal attainment behaviors, we find a significant moderating role for social connectivity: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message containing information indicating the number of users in this community who set a goal in the pretreatment month. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who have many followers (i.e., high in-degree) but do not follow many others (low out-degree) are the most susceptible to the social norms treatment. Strikingly, we find that social norms also lead to a substantially lower rate of goal attainment compared with the control message that simply highlights the benefits of setting a goal. This adverse effect is also heterogeneously experienced, conditional on the number of social ties. Our findings have important implications for the design of interventions based on social norms.

We examine how the ensuing dynamics of social commerce affect these visibility choices. We use data from a platform dedicated exclusively to facilitating the display of verified online and offline purchases with optional product commentaries. We use fixed effects and matching techniques to control for endogeneity in commentary and consumer disclosure, while embedding a new text-based model of product similarity into our econometric analysis and capturing product complementarity using network-based measures of similarity. Our findings demonstrate that disclosed purchase patterns are shaped by other users, even those with whom the discloser has no previously stated relationship. We find that the source of attention shapes disclosure behavior, and we uncover a relationship between comments and purchase similarity of disclosed purchases, suggesting that consumers play to the crowd. The negative relationship between product reviews and purchase disclosure suggest that consumers may disclose a purchase because of a relationship with that particular item and not a desire to habitually reveal purchases.

Because appointments need to be scheduled ahead of time, we refer to this problem as an optimization problem rather than a dynamic control one. We study this optimization problem in fluid and diffusion scales and identify asymptotically optimal schedules in both scales. In fluid scale, we show that it is optimal to schedule appointments so that the system is in critical load; thus, heavy-traffic conditions are obtained as a result of optimization rather than as an assumption. In diffusion scale, we solve this optimization problem in the large horizon limit. Our explicit stationary solution of the corresponding Brownian optimization problem translates the customer delay versus server overtime trade-off to a trade-off between the state of a reflected Brownian motion in the half-line and its local time at zero. Motivated by work on competitive ratios, we also consider a reference model in which an oracle provides the decision maker with the complete randomness information. The difference between the values of the scheduling problem for the two models, to which we refer as the stochasticity gap (SG), quantifies the degree to which it is harder to design a schedule under uncertainty than when the stochastic primitives (i.e., the no-shows and service times) are known in advance. In the fluid scale, the SG converges to zero, but in the diffusion scale, it converges to a positive constant that we compute. © 2019 INFORMS.","Appointment scheduling; Asymptotic optimality; Diffusion optimization; Fluid approximation; Queues; Stochastic optimization; Stochasticity gap","Brownian movement; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Optimization; Sales; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Appointment scheduling; Asymptotic optimality; Fluid approximation; Queues; Stochastic optimizations; Stochasticity; Diffusion in liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076729707

Then, utilizing relative firm efficiency and Tobin's q as performance metrics, we examine the impacts of the task interdependence choices of outsourcing firms on their performances. We examine data, collected from a variety of sources, on 184 service alliances across nine industries. We find that task interdependence in outsourced service operations increases with the knowledge dependence of outsourcing firms on their vendor firms and with other contractrelated factors, such as alliance duration, transaction complexity, and repeat relationships. Results indicate that outsourcing firms face challenges in choosing the appropriate levels of task interdependence in their outsourced service operations, and that excessive levels of task interdependence in outsourced service operations negatively affect the performances of outsourcing firms, both in terms of relative firm efficiency and long-term market value measures. Based on these results, we infer that firms need to invest in modularityenhancing service architectures that reduce task interdependences with vendors before outsourcing large-scale, knowledge-intense service operations. The study contributes to the understanding of factors that influence the performances of outsourcing firms, and provides guidelines for organizing outsourced service operations.

This study investigates how these extreme prices play as the determinants to drive price fluctuations in the electricity market. We construct a two-stage analysis including a principal component analysis (PCA) and a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags model (NARDL). We apply this analytical method to the wholesale Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland (PJM) electricity market. We find that according to PCA, in the individual transmission lines, spike prices are determinants with largest explanatory power to the variation of prices, while according to NARDL, from the standpoint of the overall market, negative prices have a larger potential effect on both the real-time market and the forward market.

First, we find two determinants of retailer clusters: the valuation-cost ratio (consumers’ maximum valuation over retailers’ production cost) and retailer density (the number of retailers over unit transportation cost). The valuation-cost ratio and retailer density indicate retailers’ profit potential and competition intensity, respectively. Second, the equilibrium cluster size increases in the valuation-cost ratio. This finding explains the phenomenon that clusters are usually larger in developing economies (where numerous retailers sell unrecognized brands with low profit potential) than in developed economies. Third, when the retailer density of a product market exceeds a certain threshold, the market coverages of clusters overlap with each other (i.e., the overlapping case). Furthermore, when compared with the nonoverlapping case, the equilibrium cluster size in the overlapping case is larger for low-profit-potential products but smaller for high-profit-potential products. Together, valuation-cost ratio and retailer density define four types of clusters: overlapping massive clusters, nonoverlapping large clusters, nonoverlapping small clusters, and overlapping mini-clusters. Finally, the socially optimal cluster size is larger than the equilibrium cluster size, and the gap between these two cluster sizes decreases in the valuation-cost ratio.

We extend this strand of research in two ways. First, we identify and empirically establish the mechanisms that bring about a higher cost of debt to privately owned firms-namely, the limited access that these firms have to the equity capital market, their high rate of management and private-equity ownership, and their less conservative reporting. Second, we improve the reliability of the estimates of the effect of ownership type on the cost of debt by controlling for the different information environments in which privately and publicly owned firms operate. This is accomplished through the use of a sample consisting of publicly owned and privately owned firms that have public debt and are therefore subject to identical reporting and disclosure requirements. Certain data and design features allow us to better control for other factors that might lead to the observed difference in the cost of debt between the two groups of firms.

Our scenario generation method is able to produce more representative scenarios by utilising the data driven properties of linear regression models and cluster based resampling. Secondly, our scenario generation method is more robust to model ‘overfitting’ by utilising a multiple of linear regression functions, hence our scenarios are more reliable. Finally, our scenario generation method enables parsimonious incorporation of decision analysis, such as worst case scenarios, hence our scenario generation facilitates decision making.

Theoretical studies suggest contradictory influences of vertical integration on operations due to operational conflicts and coordination improvement: (1) operational conflicts that raise inventory level and COGS and (2) coordination improvement that lowers inventory level and cost. Hence, the changes in inventory and COGS associated with vertical integration become an empirical question. This study applied Econometrics models to analyse proprietary data associated with a vertical integration. The results suggest non-monotonic patterns of changes in inventory level and cost of goods sold. Specifically, when various fixed effects are controlled, inventory and COGS increase first then decrease after vertical integration.

DSTs are likely to have a similar incidence to the value-added tax (VAT) in raising prices to final consumers; indeed, the DST could be viewed as a special higher rate VAT on digital services. However, the general VAT is superior on efficiency grounds to these targeted turnover taxes (i.e., taxes on gross revenues). Turnover taxes are more likely to distort production decisions by firms and to risk cascading and double taxation. This paper explores possible economic rationales for a special higher rate of indirect tax: taxing leisure complements, taxing items with higher costs of avoidance or evasion, and taxing items that generate negative externalities. It is far from clear that any of these conditions hold in the case of digital services. The administrative and other concerns with implementing a higher rate tax weigh against doing so even if the case could be made. The broader international community continues to seek a consensus-based long-term solution for addressing the tax challenges of the digitalizing economy. The economic analysis here suggests that countries that wish to act in the interim may achieve superior outcomes by continuing efforts to ensure the general VAT system applies effectively to digital services rather than by taxing turnover of digital services. © 2019 National Tax Association.

In particular, we focus on the ranking and selection problem in which the computing time is sufficient to evaluate all the designs (solutions) under consideration. Given a fixed simulation budget, we aim at maximizing the probability of correct selection (PCS) for the best feasible design, where the objective and constraint measures are assessed by their worst-case performances. To simplify the complexity of PCS, we develop an approximated probability measure and derive the asymptotic optimality condition (optimality condition as the simulation budget goes to infinity) of the resulting problem. A sequential selection procedure is then designed within the optimal computing budget allocation framework. The high efficiency of the proposed procedure is tested via a number of numerical examples.

Implications for health care industry policy are provided. Findings: A significant majority of results conclude lower costs, increased efficiency, but higher prices (due to a market concentration effect) following hospital merger or acquisition. These results are consistent with industrial organization theory and suggest that regulatory policy (e.g. price cap regulation) will raise allocative efficiency, consumer surplus and overall market surplus within markets for hospital services.

US small business formation and the jobs created by small businesses are supposed to be key elements in US economic growth. Many claim that without growth in small businesses and the jobs they provide that the US economy will either not grow at all or only very slowly. Therefore, small business is a key to understanding capitalism in the twenty-first century since under monopoly capital, there is claimed to be a tendency towards economic concentration (at the expense of small business) and towards economic stagnation. Some of the general causes mentioned for less US entrepreneurism include high levels of debt among the US populace and the increasing challenges that small businesses face against larger ones. Another concern is the amount of increasing business regulation and government presence in the US economy with which small businesses struggle more than larger ones. If entrepreneurism requires risk taking, then high levels of household debt and large, well-financed potential competitors may be hindering prospective entrepreneurs. This exploratory paper finds that these factors are highly correlated with the slowdown in the entry rates of new firms into the US economy since the late 1970s as well as with a slowdown in the job creation rate of these firms. ©The Author(s) 2019.

The second is the total rebound effect: in addition to any social status effects, the higher fuel efficiency of gasoline-electric vehicles leads to a lower cost per mile. We recover causal effects using a matching strategy to account for observable and unobservable factors that influence both hybrid adoption and miles traveled. While we do not find evidence of a significant social status rebound effect, we estimate an overall hybrid rebound of about 3 percent of the (average) annual miles traveled. This rebound effect is not sufficient to offset the reduction in fuel consumption associated with the higher fuel efficiency of the hybrid and we find that hybrid adoption reduces fuel consumption by 34–46 percent per year compared to conventional gasoline powered vehicles. © 2019","Gasoline consumption; Hybrid vehicles; Matching; Miles traveled; Rebound effects; Treatment effects","Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Gasoline; Conventional gasoline; Fuel efficiency; Gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles; Matching; Miles traveled; Rebound effect; Social signals; Treatment effects; Hybrid vehicles; annual variation; consumption behavior; energy use; fuel consumption; household energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073829425

Next, it investigates how different MPS approaches moderate the relationship between problem characteristics and throughput. To achieve these aims, we develop a mixed-effects model based on operational characteristics and the MPS development method to predict the system's throughput. The analyses are based on data from a real-world case in the automotive industry and two complex job shop systems in the literature. The experimental results indicate that the throughput of job shop systems can be predicted with a high level of accuracy (R2=0.756) based on the problem's characteristics and that the predictive model cross-validates well on a holdout sample. Moreover, we observed that the MPS method can moderate the impact of problem characteristics reflecting complexity, capacity shortages, and setup requirements on throughput, with moderation especially pronounced in the presence of capacity shortages. © 2019","Capacity shortage; Complexity; Mixed-effects models; Production planning and scheduling; Throughput prediction","Automotive industry; Forecasting; Manufacture; Production control; Scheduling; Throughput; Capacity shortage; Complexity; Manufacturing companies; Master production scheduling; Mixed effects models; Operational characteristics; Predictive modeling; Production planning and scheduling; Job shop scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064932051

Alongside, although real-time location systems (RTLS) are widely used for tracking purposes, they have not been used to develop analytical models for decision making, thus advancing the role and value of information technologies (IT). This paper proposes a data driven solution for developing prescriptive policies regarding the sequencing of care delivery activities in ambulatory care such that the goal of well-coordinated care may be achieved. Specifically, we propose a Markov Reward Process model to find the optimal care delivery sequence that minimizes patient waiting time using empirical data collected by Gen2IR/RFID technology in an outpatient clinic. We demonstrate improved sequencing of care delivery activities in comparison to status quo. The application of RFID in this study elevates the value of RTLS in healthcare from just tracking and identifying objects/persons to guiding and changing operational activities. Our method is generalizable to a variety of care coordination problems in different care delivery settings, and can be embedded in decision support systems for better operational sequencing of care delivery activities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Activity sequencing; Ambulatory care; Care coordination; Markov processes; Radio frequency identification; Real-time location systems; Value of IT","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Embedded systems; Markov processes; Real time systems; Ambulatory care; Care coordination; Markov reward process; Markov reward process model; Operational sequencing; Patient-centered care; Real time location systems; Value of IT; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060767319

Strategies such as seeking help and anticipating consequences support decision-making in these situations. Existing evidence on a measure of professional decision-making in research (the PDR) that assesses the use of decision-making strategies revealed that NIH-funded researchers born outside of the U.S. tended to score below their U.S. counterparts. To examine potential explanations for this association, this study recruited 101 researchers born in the United States and 102 born internationally to complete the PDR and measures of basic personal values, values in scientific work, discrimination between the seriousness of rules in research, exposure to unprofessional research practices, and acculturation to American culture. Several variables were associated with PDR scores—discrimination between types of rules in research, exposure to unprofessional research practices, acculturation, and the basic personal values of power, security, and benevolence. However, only security, benevolence, acculturation, and rule discrimination were also associated with nation of origin. In multivariate models, the variance explained by these variables in accounting for the association of nation of origin and PDR scores was somewhat overlapping, thus, only security and benevolence remained as unique, statistically significant predictors. Thus, this study identified some important variables in the association of nation of origin and PDR, but more research is needed. In a secondary analysis to examine the “clinical significance” (the practical importance) of scores on the PDR, this study examined aggregated PDR score data from the present sample and past samples of investigators. This analysis identified scores that may suggest a concern versus those scores that may be interpreted as excellent, proficient, or marginal.

Existing literature in healthcare performance specifically is scarce, but there is a recent increasing trend in both healthcare construction and a corresponding trend in related literature. No previously existing study has derived weights (relative importance) of performance metric in an objective, data-based manner. The purpose of this paper is to present a newly developed mathematical model that derives these weights, free of subjectivity that is common in other literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper’s model considers 17 exceptional projects and 19 average projects, and reveals the weights (or relative importance) of ten performance metrics by comparing how projects relate to one another in terms of each metric individually. It solves an eigenvalue problem that maximizes the difference between average and exceptional project performances. Findings: The most significant weight, i.e. the performance metric which has the greatest impact on healthcare project performance, was request for information per million dollars with a weight of 16.07 percent. Other highly weighted metrics included construction speed and schedule growth at 13.08 and 12.23 percent, respectively. Rework was the least significant metric at 3.61 percent, but not all metrics of quality had low ratings. Deficiency issues per million dollars was weighted at 11.61 percent, for example. All weights derived by the model in this paper were validated statistically to ensure their applicability as comparison and assessment tools. Originality/value: There is no widely accepted measure of project performance specific to healthcare construction. This study’s contribution to the body of knowledge is its mathematical model which is a landmark effort to develop a single, objective, unified project performance index for healthcare construction. Furthermore, this unified score presents a user-friendly avenue for contractors to standardize their productivity tracking – a missing piece in the practices of many contractors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Decision support systems; Productivity; Project management","Construction; Contractors; Decision support systems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Health care; Productivity; Construction projects; Design/methodology/approach; Healthcare projects; Healthcare sectors; Performance metrices; Performance metrics; Project performance; Request for informations; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068741844

These techniques include scenario network mapping, cognitive maps and fuzzy cognitive maps, as well as a new method we propose that we refer to as judgmental distillation mapping. This proposed technique is based on scenario mapping and judgmental forecasting techniques, and is intended to integrate a wide variety of forecasts into a technological map with probabilistic timelines. Judgmental distillation mapping is the centerpiece of the holistic forecasting framework in which it is used to inform a strategic planning process as well as for informing future iterations of the forecasting process. Together, the framework and new technique form a holistic rethinking of how we forecast AI. We also include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the framework, its implications for practice and its implications on research priorities for AI forecasting researchers. © 2019 by the author.

Understanding flow behavior of unmonitored streams at different temporal scales using environmental indicators is of great interest considering the logistic constraints of providing comprehensive flow instrumentation for all stream reaches in a region. Our results have applications to assess human impact in watersheds, to study environmental changes in fresh water resources, and in the management of local ecosystem. This study uses classification and regression tree analysis to identify significant explanatory variables for a predictive model of stream flow in semi-arid watersheds of southern California, USA. The study collected 77 variables with 30 years record, for a set of 48 sites, interpolated to create raster files at 30 m spatial resolution. After applying Pearson correlation analyses to eliminate redundant variables, nine variables were found to have strong positive predictive value for estimating stream flow at ungauged sites. Nine prediction rasters portraying spatial variation of stream flow for the study region at three key index months during wet, dry, and average rainfall conditions. The predictive power of the variables was tested and cross validated over a subset of data not included when building the model. Model validation by site at monthly temporal resolution showed mixed results. While some sites where accurately predicted others did not. The comparison of observed vs predicted values by month suggest that this statistically based approach is able to predict the general patterns of stream flow at the regional scale, however it may be inaccurate in estimating actual flow values by month since the models tends to under-predict monthly discharge. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-assessments; Classification analysis; Semi-arid landscapes; Stream flow","Climate models; Correlation methods; Forecasting; Water resources; Watersheds; Bio-assessments; Classification analysis; Classification and regression tree analysis; Environmental indicators; Explanatory variables; Pearson correlation analysis; Positive predictive values; Semi arid; Stream flow; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; environmental change; landscape; semiarid region; spatial variation; streamflow; watershed; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065637609

Previous research has produced highly conflicting findings: some work shows accuracy increases with more data; other research shows that it decreases. In two experiments, we found an inverted U-shaped relation between forecast error and series length for various series containing different patterns and noise levels: error decreased as the length of the series increased from five through 20 to 40 items but also decreased as the series length decreased from five through two to one item. We argue that, with short series, people use a simple heuristic approach to forecasting (e.g., the naïve forecast). With longer series, they extract patterns from the series and extrapolate from them to produce their forecasts. Use of heuristics is poorer but extraction of patterns is better when there are more items in the series. For series of intermediate length, neither type of strategy operates well, thereby producing the inverted U-shaped relation that we observed.

Despite learning from defects being a frequent recommendation to reduce defects in the construction literature, there is scarce empirical evidence into how HAs actually learn from defects. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how HAs learn from past defects and induce change to reduce defects. Design/methodology/approach: Guided by organisational learning (OL) as the theoretical lens, a 21-month action research (AR) project explored one HA’s defects management and learning processes. Findings: OL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task which is reliant on a defects management team analysing defect data to identify priority areas. As such, learning from defects can be reduced due to peaks in workload if data analysis is a manual process. Furthermore, a dual learning approach plays a significant role for HA’s learning consisting of designing out defects (codification) supported by networking (personalisation) to tackle issues of workmanship on site and those defects that cannot be designed out. Originality/value: This study demonstrates OL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task in HA’s practice; and highlights the practical challenges of academia and industry co-production in AR in construction. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Construction; Defects; Housing associations; Management; New-build housing; Organisational learning; Organization","Construction; Housing; Human resource management; Knowledge management; Management; Societies and institutions; Action research; Design/methodology/approach; Government funding; Housing association; Learning approach; Learning process; New builds; Organisational learning; Defects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068085811

Research limitations/implications: Gaining the understanding of colour’s influence on decision making and behaviour is subjected to complexity. There are many other contextual factors should be taken into consideration in practice. Although the design of the mini-test in this study is relatively simple, it still provides clues for the issue. With the discussions and findings of this paper, the authors shed some light on the direction of potential uses of colour on the communication of financial data in management context. The findings could also be used by management educators to facilitate related discussions among students regarding the complexity of business communication and the importance of perception in decision making. For example, decision making could be affected by various factors (such as colour) outside verbal and text. Originality/value: Managers often need to use financial data in communication for various purposes in work place. The authors believe this is the first time that a study like this had been conducted to specifically review and discuss the importance of colour on the communication of financial data in management. Hopefully, the work reported in this paper could be viewed as reference for management educators, researchers and managers in future research or practical applications on related topics. © 2019, Kelvin Leong, Anna Sung, Taylor Williams, Costantine Andoniou and Flora Sun.","Colour; Communication; Decision making; Financial data; Management; Perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100181132

Design/methodology/approach: An internet-based consumer survey (N = 977) conducted 22-24 October 2014 was used to collect data. The screening criteria for the survey participants were: 1) being a resident of the Mid-Atlantic region (New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA), 2) at least 21 years old, 3) not an industry member, and 4) having purchased and consumed wine within the past year. In addition to descriptive statistics, a logistic regression was used to estimate consumers’ willingness to participate in winery or vineyard tours. Independent variables were categorized into five groups: sources of wine knowledge, wine drinking occasions, demographical factors, past experience and wine purchasing behaviors. Findings: With 736 valid observations, the logistic regression shows that males are more likely to be interested in winery or vineyard tours, while young adults (<25 years old) are less likely. Learning about wines from winery tasting room staff members, from wine magazines or from local and regional magazines are the top three positive influencers on interest in these activities. Past wine tourism experience in the Mid-Atlantic region, drinking wine as an everyday beverage and giving wines as gifts also show a positive relationship with likelihood of participating in these activities. Practical implications: Study results can help the Mid-Atlantic wine industry understand wine tourists’ behaviors and preferences. Advertising in wine magazines and local and regional magazines can be used to target wine consumers interested in winery or vineyard tours. Attributes (i.e. past experience with wine tourism and gaining knowledge from winery tasting room staff) that are related to the quality of wine tourism experience were identified. Participants were also interested in purchasing wine from the winery during or after participating in wine tourism activities; therefore, wineries should focus on guest interactions to encourage such purchases. Originality/value: This survey collected data from both consumers who had or who lacked wine tourism experience, which allowed us to gather input from wine drinkers who had not necessarily visited tasting rooms. This survey instrument can be used to collect data from wine consumers residing in regions where the presence of wineries and wine tourism is low, which can provide insight that otherwise might be influenced by currently offered wine tourism activities. This paper uses an econometric approach to understand consumer interests in wine tourism in the Mid-Atlantic region and provides a comprehensive, clear and informative profile of likely wine tourism participants who reside in a region that has not been studied comprehensively. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Econometric model; Logit/probit/tobit; Market segmentation; Marketing research; Regression; Survey research; Surveys; Tourism; United States of America; Wines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067846909

Whereas previous papers assume learning from one observation per period, or experiment with control variables to gain additional information, this paper considers active learning from investment in monitoring, specifically in improved observations of the global mean temperature. We find that the decision maker invests a significant amount of money in climate research, far more than the current level, in order to increase the rate of learning about climate change. This helps the decision maker make improved decisions. The level of uncertainty decreases more rapidly in the active learning model than in the passive learning model with only temperature observations. As the uncertainty about climate change is smaller, active learning reduces the optimal carbon tax. The greater the risk, the larger is the effect of learning. The method proposed here is applicable to any dynamic control problem where the quality of monitoring is a choice variable, for instance, the precision at which we observe GDP, unemployment, or the quality of education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Active learning; Climate policy; Irreversibility; Learning; Uncertainty","Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Decision making; Economics; Quality control; Active Learning; Climate policy; Irreversibility; Learning; Uncertainty; Climate change; climate change; decision making; economic activity; environmental economics; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; global perspective; investment incentive; learning; pollution tax; temperature profile; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055998164

In our analysis, customers have different mobile accessibilities to two competing firms’ mobile technology, i.e., the fractions of customers accessible to firms’ MTP information by Apps are asymmetric. Furthermore, we also incorporate the possibility that customers could cherry pick by travelling to different locations for more attractive deals. By introducing two MTP mechanisms-tracking down & cherry picking, we investigate two competing firms’ optimal pricing strategies with symmetric as well as asymmetric mobile accessibility. In the symmetric context, MTP with tracing down dominates MTP with cherry picking on firms’ profitability, especially when the unit transportation cost is relatively high. Nevertheless, when the accessibility is asymmetric, both firms could benefit more from MTP with cherry picking when certain conditions of transportation cost hold. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.","cherry pick; customer behaviour; location-based service; Mobile targeting promotion; trace down","Location; Profitability; Sales; Telecommunication services; cherry pick; Customer behaviour; Mobile accessibilities; Mobile targeting promotion; Mobile Technology; Real-time location; trace down; Transportation cost; Location based services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068231345

Prior research finds that moral beliefs influence compliance decisions. Yet, it is less clear what factors influence moral beliefs and the conditions under which those factors have stronger/weaker effects. Using an ethical decision-making model and value congruence theory, this study aims to investigate how moral intensity and organizational criticality influence moral beliefs and intentions to perform information protection behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses were tested using a scenario-based survey of 216 organizational insiders. Two of the scenarios depict low criticality information security protection behaviors and two depict high criticality behaviors. Findings: A major finding is that users rely more on perceived social consensus and magnitude of consequences when organizational criticality is low and on temporal immediacy and proximity when criticality is high. In addition, the moral intensity dimensions explain more variance in moral beliefs when organizational criticality is low. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its sample, which is organizational insiders at a mid-size university. It is also limited in that it only examined four of the six moral intensity dimensions. Practical implications: The findings can guide management about which moral intensity dimensions are more important to focus on when remediating tone at the top and other leadership weaknesses relating to information security.

Combining nationwide data over a decade from Guyana's United Nations-approved Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) submission and national documents, we found that REDD+ implemented at national level would annually add almost a quarter to the country's budget, and should not incentivize land grabbing as it places little direct value on forest, but financial penalties (lost income) on forest damage. We show quantitatively that national REDD+ in Guyana is competitive on a hectare basis when viewed from the resource owner's perspective, even against high value commodities such as gold and timber (the country's main emission drivers), and at a preliminary US$5 carbon price. Hidden by the latter appears a very lopsided distribution of overall net revenue between the state and private sector commodity chains (∼1:99 and ∼1:1200). We show government or electorate pressure towards more equitable distribution, or ‘cleaning profit chains’, would both be justified and highly worthwhile, without job loss. Investing part of this homegrown finance in further securing lawful and rational management of exhaustible forest-based resources has several additional economic, social and environmental benefits, including for forest-dependent citizens. Society awareness of current revenue ratios, REDD+ income losses, and potential returns of interventions may add helpful (i.e. economic, domestic) motivation for forest governance change in sovereign countries. Weak law enforcement, prevailing across the tropics, enhances lopsided sharing, and linked political leverage could undermine plans that would interfere with private income streams, e.g. rural social development, tenure, forest/biodiversity conservation. Interventions may therefore additionally enhance these sectors’ performances. Assessing and cleaning private profit chains may more generally have potential for REDD+ and global climate change mitigation goals, along with its many associated social and environmental co-benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Equity; Forest commodities; Forest governance change; Land grabbing; Private state revenue ratios; REDD+ economic competitiveness","climate change; competitiveness; deforestation; emission control; forest management; gold mine; land management; land rights; logging (timber); national planning; private sector; profitability; Guyana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062000276

Escalation of commitment occurs when managers continue investment in a project after receiving negative information. A major determinant of escalation is the personal responsibility effect in that managers are more likely to escalate commitment to a failing project if they were responsible for the original investments. Prior studies suggest that a change in top management facilitates de-escalation of commitment as incoming managers who do not have such commitment are able to stop investments that are discovered to be failing.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a Computabled General Equilibrium (CGE). The Social Accounting Matrix 2008 is used to calibrate the CGE Model. There are two scenarios proposed, each is simulated with certain percentage of gas supply curtailment (50 MMSCFD, Scenario A), (100 MMSCFD, Scenario B). Findings: It is confirmed that government’s current policy to give priority to oil production is not the optimum way to maximize added value of natural gas to Indonesian economy. While oil production generates state revenue, it is industry and petrochemical sector that induces high economic impacts because of strong backward and forward linkages. Research limitations/implications: Due to the limited data availability, it is assumed that the data on the SAM 2008 are valid for describing the structure of Indonesian economy. Practical implications: The paper provides recommendation to the government to revise gas allocation policy by changing the rank of consumers’ priority.

It examined key organizational, environmental, and management factors—comprehensiveness, formalization, politicization, impact of the crisis, financial reporting—for their role in the strategy process during a crisis using regression analysis. The findings indicate that the strategy process during a crisis is influenced by several factors; specifically, politicization, formalization of the decision-making process, financial reporting, and the impact of the crisis. This study proposes an axiomatic model of cognitive decision making during a crisis. It suggests that decision making during a crisis is a complex problem-solving process contingent on several variables, which can be arranged on a scale with the proscriptive variables (variables that impede or hinder accommodation) at one end of the scale and supportive variables (variables that help advocate an organization’s position) at the other end of the scale, which when cross-joined with the advocacy/accommodation continuum yield a Cartesian product of communication options.

Design/methodology/approach: The performance data for 64 treatment firms with CDOs and 64 control firms without CDOs is collected from Compustat database. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to analyze the performance differences between treatment firms and control firms. Hierarchical regression method is used to test the moderating effect of firm size. Findings: The results indicate that the profit ratios of treatment firms are significantly improved after the appointment of CDOs, and the profit ratios of treatment firms are significantly higher than that of the control firms. For the cost ratios, the findings provide some empirical evidence revealing two of the cost ratios are lower and only one ratio is higher for the treatment firms after CDOs’ appointment. Firm size moderates the relationship between the CDO’s presence and firm performance indicator, ROS, in the same direction. Firm size has no moderating effect on relationships between CDO’s presence and other performance indicators. Practical implications: The findings provide practical insights that will help managers to realize the importance of CDOs and their work. CDOs would bring some cost to the firms, but they would bring more profit to firms. In addition, if for large firms, the CDO’s presence would bring more ROS.

We found that significant GHG mitigation is possible when substituting soybean oil for on-farm energy use, however, often the food market has higher economic value. When we characterized the conditions and consequently, the regions where on-farm soybean processing was profitable, we found that the economics and greenhouse gas abatement potential of processing soybeans on-farm improves as farm location moves towards the coastal Atlantic and Gulf regions where the economic value of the meal is higher.

The existing empirical literature usually focuses on the role of socio-demographic factors to understand this phenomenon, and theoretical studies additionally highlight the role of behavioural factors. However, empirical studies in this field are extremely scarce. The use of the LWS data enables us to fill this research gap. Separately for each country, we verify the role of individuals' risk attitudes and intertemporal choices in the demand for voluntary pension savings. To make the results more robust, we add a set of socio-demographic control variables to our regressions.

This paper explores the complementarity between social affiliations and human capital in transaction performance, and how affiliations influence the match between qualified professionals and consumers. I argue that human capital is important to professional performance, but that social affiliations lead consumers to increasingly match with lower human capital professionals. Thus, while social and human capital function as complements in transaction performance, social capital can substitute for human capital in the selection process. I test my argument using a novel approach that pairs data from a primary real estate multiple listing service in Utah with hand-collected data on geographically assigned church congregation boundaries. This setting allows me to identify listings for which real estate agents and home sellers share a common church congregation, and to explore the impact of this affiliation, as well as human capital variables, on transaction outcomes. I find that agent performance improves when listing for affiliates, on average, and that gains increase with agent human capital. However, consistent with my theory, I find that sellers are more likely to use inexperienced and underqualified affiliated agents. Human capital deficiencies reduce benefits from social affiliations and lead to inferior transaction outcomes in extreme cases. This suggests a new underexplored dark side to social capital from human capital deficiencies, which is driven by the selection process under incomplete information. © 2019 INFORMS","Agency theory; Human capital; Knowledge workers; Panel data; Productivity; Professional services; Social affiliation; Social capital",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071333254

Eye-tracking data, or gaze data, can be categorized into two main events: fixations represent focused eye movement, indicative of awareness and attention, whereas saccades are higher-velocity movements that occur between fixation events. Common methods to identify fixations in gaze data can lack sensitivity to peripheral points and may misrepresent positional and durational properties of fixations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the notion of inner density for fixation identification, which concerns both the duration of the fixation and the proximity of its constituent gaze points. Moreover, we demonstrate how to identify fixations in a sequence of gaze data by optimizing for inner density. After decomposing the clustering of a temporal gaze data sequence into successive regions (chunks), we use nonlinear and linear 0–1 optimization formulations to identify the densest fixations within a given data chunk. Our approach is parametrized by a unique constant that adjusts the degree of desired density, allowing decision makers to have fine-tuned control over density during the process. Computational experiments on real data sets demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and its effectiveness in identifying fixations with greater density than existing methods, thereby enabling the refinement of key gaze metrics such as fixation duration and fixation center.

We argue that cycles create some of the same problems for organizations as progressive change but also provide organizations an opportunity to reapply lessons as the cycle moves from phase to phase.

However, little attention has been paid to the challenges involved in providing requisite digital infrastructure services to organisations. In this paper, we argue digital infrastructure service providers operate in highly complex and uncertain environments. Rather than adopting a traditional approach to control, providers must therefore continuously negotiate a balance between control and drift as two complementary strategies. Our argument is based on a retrospective longitudinal case study of a Swedish infrastructure service team within a large international firm. Using the encounter-episode process model as structuring principle and focusing on the tension between control and drift, we analyse the evolution of the provider’s efforts to manage a portfolio of digital infrastructure services over a period of ten years. Based on these analyses, we uncover the involved complexities and dynamics, how control efforts and drift were constituted and how the infrastructure services were managed by continuously balancing control and drift. In conclusion, we relate the findings to extant literature to discuss new insights into provider management of digital infrastructure services.

Retrospective mortality prediction is a benchmarking task used by trauma care governance bodies to assist with policy decisions. We extend the similarity measure, the Optimal Temporal Common Subsequence for MESs (OTCS-MES), by generalizing the event-matching component with a plug-in weighting element. The extended OTCS-MES uses an event prevalence weight developed in our previous study and an event severity weight developed for this study. In the empirical evaluation of classification performance, we provide a more complete evaluation than previous studies. We compare the predictive performance of the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM), an accepted regression approach for mortality prediction in trauma data, to nearest neighbor algorithms using similarity measures for MESs. Using a data set from the National Trauma Data Bank, our results indicate improved predictive performance for an ensemble of nearest neighbor classifiers over TMPM. Our analysis reveals a superior Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, larger AUC, and improved operating points on a ROC curve. We also study methods to adjust for uncommon class prediction: weighted voting, neighborhood size, and case base size.

By using an advanced non-parametric estimator to overcome dimension and outlier issues, we investigate the performance of Saudi Arabian higher education institutions during the period 2008 to 2014, a period characterized by a significant increase in the government educational budget and a push for the substitution of foreign labour with local under Saudization policy. We conclude that due to spending large sums of money on sponsoring PhDs from Western institutions for local young Saudis, exponential growth in investment in relation to creating and maintaining huge educational infrastructure and reforms that allowed the private sector to participate in the higher education market resulting in a significant increase in competition, productivity improved for both public and privately owned institutions due mainly to technological progress. The larger and older publicly owned influential institutions in particular played catch-up with a shift in frontier technology as well as achieving improvements in efficiency in producing graduates. We trace the significant technological progress during the sample period to better economic conditions leading to investment made in new learning technologies and human resource development.

To date, accuracy has been inferred largely based on inter-rater reliability or agreement between SMEs and without reference to an external criterion. The current research examined job analysis rating accuracy by comparing SME importance ratings of knowledge, skills, abilities, and other requirements (KSAOs) with the validity of measures of these same KSAOs in predicting job performance. We tested hypotheses about whether SME judgement accuracy is moderated by SME job tenure, industry experience, role, self-reported knowledge of the job, and data scrubbing. Four independent tests involving 48 separate validation studies were conducted. In three of the four samples, there was a large (r =.50 range) relationship between trait importance and trait validity, showing that job analysis ratings can be directly related to test validities and serve as a measure of job analysis accuracy. Moderator analyses showed that the best results may come from supervisors, rather than incumbents, and those who know the job extremely well (there were no differences due to SME job tenure, industry experience, or deletion of outliers). Showing a direct relationship between SME judgements and actual criterion-related validity provides a new lens for operationalizing accuracy in job analysis research.

The approach makes direct use of the available data, rather than first using the data to estimate the objective function and then solving the problem as a traditional optimization problem. The difficulty in first estimating the unknown objective function is that the decision maker needs to have sufficient knowledge of its properties that are necessary to guide the estimation process. Thus, our approach is appropriate for situations where such structural knowledge is absent, either because the domain is very complex or because the knowledge is deliberately hidden by a partner firm that has a vested interest in the outcome of the decision.

According to the theory, this is because the pain of paying can be offset by the future anticipated pleasure of consumption only when money is spent on consumption that endures over time. Consistent with this prediction, we found that repayment of debt incurred for nondurable goods is an absolute 10% more likely than repayment of debt incurred for durable goods.

First, we augment the traditional Phillips curve model with the coffee price as a predictor, and show that the resulting model outperforms the traditional variant in both in-sample and out-of-sample predictability of US inflation. Second, we demonstrate the need to account for the inherent statistical features of predictors such as persistence, endogeneity, and conditional heteroskedasticity effects when dealing with US inflation. Consequently, we offer robust illustrations to show that the choice of estimator matters for improved US inflation forecasts. Third, the proposed augmented Phillips curve also outperforms time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average and the fractionally integrated version for both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. Our results show that augmenting the traditional Phillips curve with the urban coffee price will produce better forecast results for US inflation only when the statistical effects are captured in the estimation process.

We examine whether use of PMSs by individual decision makers is associated with better performance. Experimental studies have isolated individual-level effects of feedback on decision quality; however, it is difficult to extend these findings to natural settings. Archival and survey studies offer evidence on the association between the presence of PMSs and performance but have had limited success in measuring decision makers’ actual use of PMSs and addressing endogeneity of the decision to use PMSs. We use unobtrusively collected data on actual PMS use in 30 K–12 charter schools over three years to test whether teachers who make greater use of two PMSs are associated with greater growth in student learning. We find that teachers’ use of PMSs is associated with increased student learning, consistent with the premise that PMSs facilitate teacher interventions and improve student outcomes. The results are both statistically and materially significant, and they are better explained by PMS use than by selection effects of better teachers using PMSs. Consistent with the organization’s focus on “at-risk” students, the strongest effects of teachers’ use of one PMS are concentrated among the lowest-performing students. In sum, we find broad support for the thesis that the feedback role of PMSs is associated with meaningful performance improvement. © 2019 INFORMS","Assessment; Education sector; Management information system; Performance management","Feedback; Information management; Management information systems; Students; Assessment; Decision quality; Education sectors; Individual levels; Management control; Performance management; Performance measurement system; Student learning; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072513323

Using New York City taxi data from 2013, we test the level of alignment between the revenue maximizing behavior of drivers versus safety, conservation and pollution-related outcomes that are valued by stakeholders. We find substantial misalignment—i.e., in order to maximize revenue, drivers take inefficient routes and they exceed the speed limit thus decreasing safety, increasing fuel consumption and increasing air pollution. Based on these empirical results, we suggest methods of aligning societal goals with those of revenue maximizing taxi drivers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Digital data; New York city; Policy alignment; Public safety; Taxi","business; incentive; policy analysis; profitability; sustainability; taxi transport; transportation economics; transportation safety; urban transport; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051048600

This study, which aims to investigate the social acceptance of stump harvesting for bioenergy production in Finland, was conducted in two stages: a questionnaire-based study and a subsequent literature-based study. The latter provides information concerning the beneficial or harmful consequences of stump harvesting, and this information could be used to gain support for stump harvesting's use or abandonment by stakeholders of forest utilisation. The questionnaire survey was conducted in 2013 at the SILVA fair organised by the Association of Finnish Forestry centre in Joensuu, Finland, and the literature-based study was conducted in 2018. Six social groups were defined: higher administrative, lower administrative, skilled or specialized workers, farm and forestry workers, students, and others. The results of the questionnaire revealed that, although different social groups are highly interested in using stump wood for energy purposes, respondents think that stump harvesting will not be able to raise their incomes. Respondents are also unmotivated, with even forestry workers expressing critical views on the promotion of stump harvesting for energy purposes due to the environmental consequences. The literature-based study revealed that scientific results on stump harvesting are contradictory. It is crucial to involve different social groups and to reflect on their opinions regarding the use of stump wood as a forest management tool and for bioenergy production. As Finland moves toward a bioeconomy, the study of social acceptance of stump harvesting will direct the development of stump harvesting for bioenergy production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Environment; Social acceptance; Social group","Biomass; Forestry; Social aspects; Surveys; Timber; Bio-energy; Bioenergy productions; Environment; Environmental consequences; Information concerning; Questionnaire surveys; Social acceptance; Social groups; Harvesting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065656575

Octopuses are fished in intertidal and subtidal areas using various fishing gear, with trawling used by industrial fleets and hand jigs, pots, traps, and trammel nets used by small-scale fleets. Over the years, the octopus has consistently been one of the most important commercial cephalopod resources in Senegal. Given the high economic value of octopus in Senegal, this paper discusses octopus management, as well as the industry's direct impacts on the biological traits of octopus. Survey data reveals that there are some differences in the octopus management preferences within Mbour; however, in general, fishers support biological rest and the use of octopus spawning pots. This study examines the socioeconomic importance of octopus and their management by scientifically analyzing the octopus fishery in Senegal. Octopuses have a short life span (12–14 months), grow rapidly, and have high natural mortality due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Therefore, the abundance index decreased from 13.7 kg per days at sea in 1999 to 3.3 kg per days at sea in 2016 due to seasonal fluctuations. Meanwhile, landing volumes notably increased from 2980 t in 1997 to 5932 t in 2016.

Specifically, they developed a simulation model to examine the extent to which hospitals would benefit economically from the transitional care model (TCM). The TCM is designed to transition high-risk older adults from hospitals back to communities using interventions focused on preventing readmissions.The authors used qualitative methods to identify and validate simulation facets. Four simulation experiments explored the economic impact of the TCM on more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals: (1) magnitude of readmission penalty, (2) application to specific diagnosis-related groups, (3) level of cost sharing between payer and provider, and (4) capitated versus fee-for-service payments. The simulator projected hospital-specific economic effects. The authors used Monte Carlo methods for the simulations, which were parameterized with public data sets from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and TCM data from randomized controlled trials and comparative effectiveness studies.Under current conditions, the simulation indicated that only 10 of more than 3,000 Medicare-certified hospitals would benefit financially from the TCM. If current readmission penalties were doubled, the number of hospitals projected to benefit would increase to 300. Targeting selected diagnosis cohorts would also increase the number of hospitals to 300. If payers reimbursed providers for 100% of the TCM costs, 2,000 hospitals would benefit financially. Under a capitated payment model, 1,500 hospitals would benefit from the TCM.Current CMS penalties-or reasonable increases-have little economic effect on the TCM. In the current environment, two strategies are likely to facilitate adoption: (1) persuading payers to reimburse TCM costs and (2) focusing on hospitals with higher bed occupancies and higher revenue patients. © 2019 Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives.

Although the tenets of dual process theory would argue that effortful thinking should attenuate people's reliance on heuristics, a number of contemporary findings suggest otherwise: Effortful thinking may, in fact, enhance biased processing of information in certain instances. This research shows how, in the context of pricing, people's degrees of effortful thinking can amplify their inclination towards biased processing of price information. In five studies (n = 1,339), we find that effortful thinking induces a greater preference for nine-ending (vs. zero-ending) prices, and the effect is mainly driven by people's greater propensity for argument-based decision making. Such predilection to nine-endings attenuates with lower cognitive effort in processing price information. Moreover, when locus of deliberation shifts from price to quality, consumers' preference for nine-ending priced options is subdued. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","argument-based decision making; effortful thinking; need for cognition; nine-ending price; zero-ending price","article; consumer; decision making; human; human experiment; major clinical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058455818

A total of 378 valid questionnaires were utilised, representing a valid response rate of 63%. The following indicators were identified and investigated through quantitative analysis: corruption, capacity building, employment/financial strength, professional rivalry, professional vested interests, technological expertise, professional involvement in decision-making, human rights and public opinion from the earlier research in Nigeria. Using SPSS software with the Amos add-on, factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to investigate the data, which revealed that corruption, professional rivalry, professional vested interest and professional involvement in decision-making as a combined administrative factor were the most influential in leading to non-compliance with building code standards in residential development projects in Nigeria, followed by training and, to a lesser extent, sociological factors.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced recession prediction model that incorporates trends in the value of the yield spread. We expect our model to generate stronger recession signals because a steadily declining value of the yield spread typically indicates growing pessimism associated with the reduced future business activity. We capture trends in the yield spread by considering both the level of the yield spread at a lag of 12 months as well as its value at each of the previous two quarters leading up to the forecast origin, and we evaluate its predictive abilities using both logit and artificial neural network models. Our results indicate that models incorporating information from the time series of the yield spread correctly predict future recession periods much better than models only considering the spread value as of the forecast origin. Furthermore, the results are strongest for our artificial neural network model and logistic regression model that includes interaction terms, which we confirm using both a blocked cross-validation technique as well as an expanding estimation window approach. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial neural networks; classification; cross-validation; Forecasting; logistic regression",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055575195

Therefore, such conditions need not hold in estimation. We apply Bayesian econometrics to estimate a flexible production function using U.S. agricultural data under alternative restrictions dictated by theory, including a fully theoretically consistent model that satisfies all restrictions at each point of the data. The probability density functions of parameters, output elasticities, scale elasticity, and productivity gains vary substantially across models. Output elasticities from the fully theoretically consistent model suggest that agricultural production in the United States has typically been more responsive to land than to other factors of production. However, output became more responsive over time to changes in materials, and less responsive to changes in land and labor. By the early 2000s, the elasticity of output to materials was very similar to the elasticity of output to land. The elasticity of output to capital remained relatively stable over the entire sample. The estimates from the fully theoretically consistent model also show a slight increase in the average rate of productivity gains between the 1960s and the 1970s, a relative slowdown in the 1980s and 1990s, and a relative stabilization afterwards.

Consumers evaluate different alternatives and then come to a decision. Prior research suggests that consumer evaluations leading to choice are comparative in nature and can be affected by other alternatives or reference products. This study proposes a mixtures-of-experts model framework to examine the role of different reference products in consumer choice of multi-attribute products. While multiple external and internal reference points have been proposed, previous studies have very rarely investigated more than one reference point in the same model. Using data from a choice-based conjoint experiment, our empirical model enables us to identify which product consumers tend to use as the reference product by incorporating four different reference products and includes consumer characteristics to examine how consumers differ in their utilization of different reference products. The results show that our model outperforms other reference-dependent models in prior literature. In our empirical context of smartphone choices, the most commonly used reference product is the most preferred product in the choice set, while the least preferred product and the average product are rarely used. We also examine the role of consumer characteristics such as gender, product familiarity, and product interest in utilizing reference products. This paper provides insights into the unobserved comparison process in consumer choice, which can be applied to decision support systems such as recommendation engines. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Choice based conjoint; Comparison effect; Consumer decision making; Mixtures-of-experts model; Recommendation engines; Reference product","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Engines; Mixtures; Recommender systems; Choice-based conjoint; Comparison effect; Consumer decision making; Mixtures of experts; Reference product; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062825031

Design/methodology/approach: The paper relied upon survey data and actual usage information from a culturally diverse sample of 227 individuals who were introduced to the specific security problem and the accepted solution of using a password manager application. Findings: The paper provides empirical evidence that the effect of positive attitudes increased when individuals were more long-term oriented, but the effect was reversed for average/negative attitudes toward the voluntary security behavior. Furthermore, participants with high long-term orientation and strong positive attitudes toward the security action actually adopted password manager applications 57 per cent more than the average adoption rate across the sample. Research limitations/implications: Due to the research approach (survey data), security context and sample population, the research results may lack generalizability. Practical implications: The findings suggest that security awareness messaging and training should account for differences in long-term orientation of the target audience and integrate the distinctly different types of messages that have been shown to improve an individual’s participation in voluntary security actions.

The implication being that reductions in resource consumption in some cost areas can disproportionally reduce total resource consumption. Efforts to develop and disseminate innovative solutions to improve efficiency can, therefore, be targeted to these high cost areas, resulting in larger efficiency improvements than might otherwise be achieved. An input–output model is used for this examination and is combined with labor data and data on assets. The top 20 industries, occupations, and industry occupation combinations contributing to production are identified. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model using Monte Carlo simulation. The results confirm that costs are disproportionally distributed, having a Gini coefficient of 0.75 for value added and for compensation it is 0.86. Wholesale trade, aircraft manufacturing, and the management of companies and enterprises were the industries with the largest contribution to assembly-centric manufacturing, even when including imports. Energy in the form of electricity and natural gas were discussed separately, but would rank 8th if compared to the industry rankings. In terms of occupation activities, team assemblers, general and operations managers, and sales representatives were the largest occupations. Public entities might use this model and results to identify efficiency improvement efforts that will have the largest impact on industry per dollar of expenditure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Efficiency; Input output analysis; Manufacturing; Public investment; Supply chain","Costs; Efficiency; Employment; Fighter aircraft; Human resource management; Intelligent systems; Investments; Machinery; Manufacture; Monte Carlo methods; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Aircraft manufacturing; Efficiency improvement; Innovative solutions; Input output analysis; Public investments; Resource consumption; Sales representatives; Transportation equipments; Assembly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018839448

It measured procedural knowledge in addition to aspects of declarative knowledge and fluid abilities, and this was considered as a good predictor of performance for wind technicians. The results indicate that rescue and evacuation skills decay within 1 month and 3 months after wind turbine rescue and evacuation training with 47 and 20% of technicians experiencing such decay in their skills and knowledge. These findings have practical implications for activities involving rescue and evacuation of workers-for example, crane driver rescue. The implementation of SJTs and JKTs indicates that skill decay takes place within the first 4 weeks after acquisition.

The research period covers the years following accession into the European Union, from 2004 until 2018. This study aims to answer the following question: What effects have resulted from the integration with the European Union in terms of the sphere of productivity? The analysis covers two main categories of labour productivity growth: pure labour productivity growth and structural labour productivity growth. Moreover, factors that may affect both pure and structural productivity changes are examined. The main research techniques are shift-share analysis and panel data methods. The analysis shows that all the CEE countries in the studied period improved in terms of both pure and structural productivity. The impact of pure labour productivity, however, was much smaller than that of structural labour productivity; this means that the main change in productivity level was more attributable to changes in employment between sectors than to the modernisation of technological processes. Productivity increased in all sectors, but the most significant growth occurred in service sectors, specifically in financial and insurance activities and real estate activities. Simultaneously, employment decreased in less productive sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Furthermore, the results of the panel data analysis confirm a significant impact of the evaluated factors on pure and structural productivity growth. Thus, aggregate productivity change in the CEE area can have a positive impact on both forms of productivity growth. Both structural and pure productivity growth are stimulated by research and development expenditures, information and communication technology (ICT) goods imports, and trade openness. Moreover, this research confirms the positive impacts of business enterprise research and development expenditure growth and an increase in the number of researchers to the workforce ratio on sector productivity, although there are substantial differences between sectors. This research can be used by government agencies in establishing industrial development policies. © 2019, UNIVRIJEKA.

Academic/practical relevance: Under a persistent policy, allocations remain nearly constant irrespective of circumstances; under a dynamic policy, R&D spending increases (respectively, declines) when opportunities arise (respectively, fail tomaterialize). Practitioners give conflicting answers as to which policy is preferable, while there is no rigorous academic guidance. Methodology: We use a sample of 3,711 publicly listed companies, observed for seven years (on average) between 1982 and 2003, to compare the outcomes of these R&D allocation policies. Weestimate a firm-level dynamic panel data model, via the ""system general method of moments"" (S-GMM) approach (Arellano and Bond 1991, Blundell and Bond 1998), which combines financial information fromtheCompustat database with patent data provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Results: We find that a dynamic allocation strategy is associated with worse R&D performance in terms of patent quantity and quality. Our results indicate that the originality of an invention, and also the firm's familiarity with an invention's technological basis, are factors that can mitigate or amplify the harm caused by variability. Finally, we establish that R&D performance suffers from the unpredictable part of dynamic spending; the predictable part has either no effect or a positive one. Managerial implications: There aremanyreasonswhy managersmaywish to alter the level ofR&Dspending. Some of these reasons (e.g., pursuing technological opportunities) reflect more positive intentions than do others (e.g., chasing targets for earnings).Whatever the rationale for a change in spending, our paper highlights the possible negative consequences that managers should consider; it also documents the contingencies under which adaptation is especially harmful and identifies policies for mitigating adaptation pains. Thus, we offer managers a framework for conceptualizing principles about how best to invest in R&D. Our paper also issues this warning about the goal of hitting quarterly financial targets: if R&D spending is viewed as discretionary when such targets must be met- which is customary (as documented by Roychowdhury 2006) for some publicly traded companies-then one should expect to observe long-term negative consequences that cannot be reversed simply by later restoring or even increasing R&D investment.

For purposes of electricity management and utilization of scarce resources, Iran’s 33 provinces have been classified into five regions by the Ministry of the Interior. Analyzing the efficiency of distribution companies across these regions yields significant understanding of these resources and helps policymakers to generate more informed decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed method of this study develops nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) with the consideration of geographic classification, size and type of company. At the first stage, a DEA model is used to estimate the relative technical efficiency and productivity change of these companies. At the second stage, distributions of efficiency improvements are examined based on geographic classification, size and type of the company type. A stability test is also conducted to verify the proposed model’s robustness. Findings: The results demonstrate that the average technical efficiency of the companies increased during the years 2006-2009, but decreased during 2010-2014. The productivity measurement reveals that low efficiency change was the largest contributor to the small increase in productivity change rather than technology change. In addition, testing the hypothesis that the large and small companies have statistically the same efficiency scores revealed no statistical difference among them. Moreover, another test did not detect a difference among companies at the urban and provincial levels. Practical implications: By applying this approach, policymakers and practitioners in the power industry at the country and corporate level can effectively compare the efficiency and productivity changes among electricity distribution companies, and therefore generate more informed decisions. Originality/value: The paper’s novel concept applies DEA to Iran’s electricity distribution companies and analyzes them by examining geographic classification, size and the type of the companies. In addition, a stability test is conducted and productivity changes are estimated. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Correlation analysis; DEA; Efficiency; Electricity distribution; Energy balance; Energy sector; Input-output tables; Linear programming; Optimization; Productivity; Resource management","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Electric utilities; Energy balance; Geographical distribution; Linear programming; Optimization; Productivity; Correlation analysis; Electricity distribution; Energy sector; Input-output table; Resource management; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074349079

Recently, more and more researchers investigated DEA models without explicit input (DEA-WEI). DEA-WEI models can divide DMUs into two categories: efficient DMUs and inefficient DMUs. Usually there is a set of DMUs, which are 'efficient' so that conventional DEA models could not rank them. In this paper, we first develop a performance index based on efficient and anti-efficient frontiers in DEA-WEI models. Further, the corresponding performance index in DEA-WEI models with quadratic utility terms (quadratic DEA-WEI) is proposed also. Finally, we present two case studies on performance assessment of basketball players and the evaluation of research institutes in Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to show the applicability and usefulness of the performance indices developed in this paper. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Anti-efficient frontier; Data envelopment analysis; DEA without explicit input; Efficient frontier",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070771281

It allows companies to save costs on infrastructure and maintenance and to focus on the development of products. However, this fast-growing paradigm has brought along some concerns from users, such as the integrity and security of the data, particularly in environments where users rely entirely on providers to secure their data. This paper explores different techniques to fragment data on the cloud and prevent direct unauthorised access to the data. It explores their performance on a cloud instance, where the total time to perform the operation, including the upload and download of the data, is considered. Results from this experiment indicate that fragmentation algorithms show better performance compared to encryption. Moreover, when combining encryption with fragmentation, there is an increase in the security, with the trade-off of the performance.

With hundreds of new funds introduced into the market each year, an essential question to ask is whether this voluminous growth promotes funds' efficiency, as funds compete for investment. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional portfolio performance metrics, this study utilizes a non-parametric model, data envelopment analysis (DEA), to assess the relative efficiency of equity and hybrid funds for 2016-2018. The empirical results show that despite the development in the fund industry, only a small portion of the funds are fully efficient. While efficiency improvement is observed in equity funds, the efficiency in hybrid funds actually deteriorates. On average, equity funds are more efficient and persistent in performance than hybrid funds. The empirical results also indicate that the primary areas of inefficiency are downside risk management and fund fee structures. For hybrid funds, fund size is also related to efficiency performance. The findings of this study offer implications for how to strengthen the development and stability of the Chinese mutual fund market. © Carol C.

Bayesian approaches to conjoint analysis quantify this uncertainty with a multivariate distribution that is updated after the respondent answers. Unfortunately, this update often requires multidimensional integration, which effectively reduces the adaptive selection of questions to impractical enumeration. An alternative approach is the polyhedral method for adaptive conjoint analysis, which quantifies the uncertainty through a (convex) polyhedron. The approach has a simple geometric interpretation and allows for quick credibility-region updates and effective optimization-based heuristics for adaptive question selection. However, its performance deteriorates with high response-error rates. Available adaptations to this method do not preserve all of the geometric simplicity and interpretability of the original approach. We show how, by using normal approximations to posterior distributions, one can include response error in an approximate Bayesian approach that is as intuitive as the polyhedral approach and allows the use of effective optimization-based techniques for adaptive question selection. This ellipsoidal approach extends the effectiveness of the polyhedral approach to the high response-error setting and provides a simple geometric interpretation (from which the method derives its name) of Bayesian approaches. Our results precisely quantify the relationship between the most popular efficiency criterion and heuristic guidelines promoted in extant work. We illustrate the superiority of the ellipsoidal method through extensive numerical experiments. © 2019 INFORMS.","Bayesian models; Conjoint analysis; Geometric methods; Mixed-integer programming","Bayesian networks; Errors; Geometry; Integer programming; Numerical methods; Statistical methods; Surveys; Bayesian model; Conjoint analysis; Geometric interpretation; Geometric method; Mixed integer programming; Multidimensional integration; Multivariate distributions; Optimization-based techniques; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068450104

A driving motivation behind our model is the emergence of real-time bidding markets for online display advertising in which such budgets are prevalent. We assume the seller has a strong form of limited commitment: she commits to the rules of the current auction but cannot commit to those of future auctions. We show that the celebrated Myersonian approach that leverages the envelope theorem fails in this setting, and therefore, characterizing the dynamic optimal mechanism seems intractable. Despite these challenges, we derive and characterize a near-optimal dynamic mechanism. To do so, we show that the Myersonian approach is recovered in a corresponding fluid continuous time model in which the time interval between consecutive items becomes negligible. Then we leverage this approach to characterize the optimal dynamic direct-revelation mechanism, highlighting novel incentives at play in settings with buyers’ budget constraints and seller’s limited commitment. We show through a combination of theoretical and numerical results that the optimal mechanism arising from the fluid continuous time model approximately satisfies incentive compatibility for the buyers and is approximately sequentially rational for the seller in the original discrete time model. © 2019 INFORMS.","Budget constraints; Display advertising; Dynamic mechanism design; Fluid approximation; Internet auctions; Limited commitment; Revenue management","Budget control; Commerce; Continuous time systems; Machine design; Sales; Budget constraint; Display advertisings; Dynamic mechanism; Fluid approximation; Internet auctions; Limited commitment; Revenue management; Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068436348

The byproducts of this innovative approach (LLGMM) are the balance between model specification and model prescription of continuous-time dynamic process and the development of discrete-time interconnected dynamic model of local sample mean and variance statistic process (DTIDMLSMVSP). Moreover, LLGMM is a dynamic non-parametric method. The DTIDMLSMVSP is an alternative approach to the GARCH(1,1) model, and it provides an iterative scheme for updating statistic coefficients in a system of generalized method of moment/observation equations. Furthermore, applications of LLGMM to energy commodities price, U.S. Treasury Bill interest rate and the U.S.-U.K. foreign exchange rate data strongly exhibit its unique role, scope and performance, in particular, in forecasting and confidence-interval problems in applied statistics. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","conceptual computational/theoretical parameter estimation scheme; forecasting; mean square optimal procedure; method of moments; nonparametric; reaction/response time delay; simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060695794

The QSAM has been conducted using various data collection techniques (such as observations, process activity mapping, interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming and access to company documents) and data analysis methods (including cause and effect analysis, Pareto analysis and time series plot). This is followed by the development of a set of improvement strategies, namely, direct information sharing, priority planning, and additional data recording and analysis. In addition to testing the potential benefits of changing scheduling approaches for the paint plant, simulation has been utilized in this study as a communication means to increase employee participation in the QSAM process and enhance the audit accuracy.

The problem is even harder in the face of multidimensional budget constraints, particularly in the presence of many decision variables involved and the interplay among the decision variables through such constraints. Concise bidding strategies help advertisers deal with this challenge by introducing fewer variables upon which to act. In this paper, we study the problem of finding optimal concise bidding strategies for advertising campaigns with multiple budget constraints. Given bid landscapes-that is, the predicted value (e.g., number of clicks) and the cost per click for any bid-that are typically provided by ad-serving systems, we optimize the value of an advertising campaign given its budget constraints. In particular, we consider bidding strategies that consist of no more than k different bids for all keywords. For constant k, we provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme to optimize the profit, whereas for arbitrary k we show how a constant-factor approximation algorithm can be obtained via a combination of solution enumeration and dependent LP rounding techniques, which can be of independent interest. In addition to being able to deal with multidimensional budget constraints, our results do not assume any specific payment scheme and can be applied on pay-per-click, pay-per-impression, or pay-per-conversion models. Also, no assumption about the concavity of value or cost functions is made. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms on real data sets in regimes with up to six-dimensional budget constraints. In the case of a single budget constraint, in which uniform bidding (currently used in practice) has a provable performance guarantee, our algorithm beats the state of the art by an increase of 1%-6% in the expected number of clicks. This is achieved by only two or three clusters in contrast with the single cluster permitted in uniform bidding. With multiple budget constraints, the gap between the performance of our algorithm and an enhanced version of uniform bidding grows to an average of 5%-6% (and as high as 35% in higher dimensions). © 2019 INFORMS","Bidding strategies; Budget constraints; Concise bidding; Internet advertising; Revenue management; Uniform bidding","Approximation algorithms; Cost functions; Decision making; Marketing; Polynomial approximation; Bidding strategy; Budget constraint; Concise bidding; Internet advertising; Revenue management; Uniform bidding; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075966232

Enhanced indexation uses the returns of an index as a reference point and aims at outperforming this index. The motivation behind enhanced indexing is that the indices and portfolios available to academics and practitioners for asset pricing and benchmarking are generally inefficient and, thus, susceptible to enhancement. In this paper we propose a novel technique based on the concept of cumulative utility area ratios and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to construct enhanced indices from the DJIA and S&P500. Four main conclusions are forthcoming. First, the technique, called the utility enhanced tracking technique (UETT), is computationally parsimonious and applicable for all return distributions. Second, if desired, cardinality constraints are simple and computationally parsimonious. Third, the technique requires only infrequent rebalancing, monthly at the most. Finally, the UETT portfolios generate consistently higher out-of-sample utility profiles and after-cost returns for the fully enhanced portfolios as well as for the enhanced portfolios adjusted for cardinality constraints. These results are robust to varying market conditions and a range of utility functions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AHP; Asset management; Index tracking; Investments; Portfolio allocation; Utility functions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067617688

In this study, we argue that buying specific product categories involve embarrassment and that such products are characterized by certain emotional distress that would impact the buying behavior of consumers. We also argue that content relevant personalization may not have the same impact while buying embarrassing products as against normal products. We followed a controlled lab experiment and tested our hypotheses by analyzing click stream data such as time taken, number of clicks, and number of products added to the cart. We found that online buyers resort to reduced time to shop as a coping strategy to deal with the distress of buying embarrassing products. Our results provide evidence for customers' preference to complete the online buying process with minimum time and activities when high embarrassment products were involved, despite the provisioning of personalization. In other words, users were more concerned about their embarrassment for category of products irrespective of whether the website contents are personalized or not.

This approach, based on knowledge management (KM), implies the need to take into consideration the dynamic aspect of both the internal and the external environment. The article identifies key knowledge management enablers (KMEs) that can affect the successful design of a competitive BPA. Generic identification of KMEs with their main interactions can be useful to drive the development of a dynamic and competitive BPA. Semantic representation using ontologies is a means to accomplish this identification and to specify the necessary abstract level of the KMEs domain. This research utilizes the newly developed abstract KMEs ontology (aKMEOnt) that formally defines an essential pillar of the KM domain to present a knowledge-based approach for BPA modelling, with the novel KMEOntoBPA framework. Thus, one of the anticipated corollaries of this research is the integration between KM and BPA disciplines. The design science research methodology (DSRM) has been used to guide the research phases, which mainly include the design and development, demonstration and evaluation of the research framework. The financing department of a key international bank in Jordan is the case study that has been applied in this research. The research findings show that using a knowledge-based approach with ontologies can provide a dynamic and continuous generation of the BPA elements of the financing department. Furthermore, a knowledge-based BPA approach has several advantages and supports the sources of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.","Architecture; Banking; Business process; Enablers; Knowledge; Knowledge; Management; Management; Ontologies; Riva method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074720861

Research in connection to Big Data and cyber asset management is embryonic. Using evidence, the purpose of this paper is to argue that asset management in the context of Big Data is punctuated by a variety of vulnerabilities that can only be estimated when characteristics of such assets like being intangible are adequately accounted for. Design/methodology/approach: Evidence for the study has been drawn from interviews of leaders of digital transformation projects in three organisations that are within the insurance industry, natural gas and oil, and manufacturing industries. Findings: By examining the extant literature, the authors traced the type of influence that Big Data has over asset management within organisations. In a context defined by variability and volume of data, it is unlikely that the authors will be going back to restricting data flows. The focus now for asset managing organisations would be to improve semantic processors to deal with the vast array of data in variable formats. Research limitations/implications: Data used as evidence for the study are based on interviews, as well as desk research. The use of real-time data along with the use of quantitative analysis could lead to insights that have hitherto eluded the research community. Originality/value: There is a serious dearth of the research in the context of innovative leadership in dealing with a threatened asset management space. Interpreting creative initiatives to deal with a variety of risks to data assets has clear value for a variety of audiences. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Databases; Estimation; Forecasting; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070304875

Recently, health care providers have been using different types of tools with prediction capabilities. Sepsis is one of the leading causes of in-hospital death in the United States and worldwide. In this study, the authors used a large medical dataset to develop and present a model that predicts in-hospital mortality among Sepsis patients. The predictive model was developed using a dataset of more than one million records of hospitalized patients. The independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified using the chi-square automatic interaction detector. The authors found that adding hospital attributes to the predictive model increased the accuracy from 82.08% to 85.3% and the area under the curve from 0.69 to 0.84, which is favorable compared to using only patients’ attributes.

Thus the pricing of financial, pension and insurance products that are contingent upon survival or death and which is related to the accuracy of central mortality rates is of key importance. Recently, a temperature-related mortality (TRM) model was proposed by Seklecka et al. (Journal of Forecasting, 2017, 36(7), 824–841), and it has shown evidence of outperformance compared with the Lee and Carter (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1992, 87, 659–671) model and several others of its extensions, when mortality-experience data from the UK are used. There is a need for awareness, when fitting the TRM model, of model risk when assessing longevity-related liabilities, especially when pricing long-term annuities and pensions. In this paper, the impact of uncertainty on the various parameters involved in the model is examined. We demonstrate a number of ways to quantify model risk in the estimation of the temperature-related parameters, the choice of the forecasting methodology, the structures of actuarial products chosen (e.g., annuity, endowment and life insurance), and the actuarial reserve. Finally, several tables and figures illustrate the main findings of this paper. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","actuarial pricing; forecasting methodologies; model risk; reserve; temperature-related mortality model; uncertainty","Costs; Forecasting; Insurance; Investments; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Financial sectors; Governmental agency; Life insurance industry; Model risks; Mortality model; Parameter uncertainty; reserve; uncertainty; Population statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053929624

A grid search procedure to minimise the MSE is often used in practice to fit exponential smoothing methods, especially in large inventory control applications. Grid searches are also found in some modern statistical software. We ask whether the ex ante forecast accuracy of the damped trend method of exponential smoothing can be improved by optimising parameters. Furthermore, we ask whether the method should be fitted according to a mean absolute error criterion rather than the mean squared error commonly used in practice. We found that model-fitting matters. Parameter optimization makes significant improvements in forecast accuracy regardless of the fit criterion.

Unfortunately, data quality tags have not been successfully adopted despite their potential to assist decision makers. One reason for the non-adoption is that maintaining the tags is expensive and time-consuming: having a tag that represents accuracy, for example, would be massively time-consuming to measure because it requires some physical observation of reality to check the true value. We argue that a useful surrogate tag for accuracy can be created—without having to physically measure it—by counting the number of times the data has been exposed to an event that could cause it to become inaccurate. Experimental results show that the tags can help to avoid problems caused by inaccuracies, and also to help find the inaccuracies themselves. © 2019","Accuracy; Data analytics; Data quality; Data tags; Information quality; Metadata","Data Analytics; Decision making; Information systems; Metadata; Accuracy; Data quality; Data tags; Decision makers; Exposed to; Information quality; Potential problems; Information use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065254295

Financial liberalization is specified in terms of reducing the costs of both foreign lending and borrowing. The mechanism is their impact on the international portfolio and its consequences for the share of domestic capital and its effect on domestic activity. Reduced foreign lending costs tends to divert resources from the domestic economy, raising the share of domestic output allocated to the government, while reducing borrowing costs have the opposite effects. Consequently more international financial liberalization is associated with larger governments in creditor countries, but not necessarily so in debtor economies. These results are supported by numerical simulations, as are our results for volatility.

Incorporating multiple, and likely competing, objectives is critical for balancing trade-offs on different aspects of performance. When multiple objectives are considered, it is often hard to make a precise decision on how to weight the different objectives when combining their performance for ranking and selecting designs. We show that there are situations when selecting a design with near-optimality for a broad range of weight combinations of the criteria is a better test selection strategy compared with choosing a design that is strictly optimal under very restricted conditions. We propose a new design selection strategy that identifies several top-ranked solutions across broad weight combinations using layered Pareto fronts and then selects the final design that offers the best robustness to different user priorities. This method involves identifying multiple leading solutions based on the primary objectives and comparing the alternatives using secondary objectives to make the final decision. We focus on the selection of screening designs because they are widely used both in industrial research, development, and operational testing.

In this process, it is important to understand potential tradeoffs concerning final product design and redesign decisions. The objective of the present study is to characterize such tradeoffs using a set of six factors affecting product design: business strategy, economic considerations, functionality and performance, health/environmental endpoints, public perception, and regulatory factors. These factors were further disaggregated into 33 attributes distributed across the six factors. We assessed (i) tradeoff weights for each factor and (ii) the degree of influence of factors and attributes on a recent product design or redesign using a survey targeted at chemical and product manufacturers. Results from 33 completed surveys show that two factors are statistically different from equal weighting across the six factors: health/environmental endpoints and regulatory factors. Important attributes (and their factors) include: product price (economic considerations), product performance (functionality and performance), meeting desired specifications (functionality and performance), and company reputation (public perception). Principal component analysis yields nine principal components explaining 79% of the variance in the attribute scores dataset. These components load heavily on attributes such as public awareness of human and environmental health concerns, company reputation, product performance, and product price. The broader implications of our study include a realization that the context of the decision may dictate how business and economic concerns may be addressed differently than health and environmental endpoint concerns with the goal of navigating decision tradeoffs among manufacturers.

This paper aims to investigate the strategic challenges faced by coastal regions in the Channel area that are not first movers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a multiple case study approach to analyse the behaviour of regional stakeholders when planning and assessing their participation in the renewable energy sector. Findings: The paper reveals the tendency of regional planners to idealise investments in renewable energy. The negative consequences of idealisation are inadequate strategic visions. Research limitations/implications: The findings are only relevant in the context of the regions that are part of the case study. Practical implications: The paper illustrates how idealisation of technology or strategy is created and how it impacts strategic decision-making. It also discusses how to address idealisation. Social implications: Although much of the energy policy literature discusses the challenge of social acceptance, this paper documents an opposite phenomenon, idealisation. There is a need in the energy sector to find a middle ground between these two extremes.

We show that the model is tractable under mild conditions. The framework is a generalization of several existing models, including stochastic programming, robust optimization, distributionally robust optimization. Using this framework, we study a few new models which imply probabilistic guarantees for solutions and yield less conservative results compared to traditional models.

The standard multivariate test used in studies comparing the performance of asset pricing models requires the number of stocks to be less than the number of time series observations, which requires grouping stocks into portfolios. This results in a loss of disaggregate stock information. We apply a different statistical test to overcome this problem and to investigate relative performance of alternative asset pricing models using individual security returns instead of portfolio returns. Our findings suggest that a parsimonious six-factor model that includes the momentum and orthogonal value factors outperforms all other models based on a number of measures as well as the average F-test. Unlike the standard multivariate test, we find that the average F-test has superior power to discriminate among competing models and does not reject all tested models. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Asset pricing; book-to-market; factor models; investment; liquidity risk; market portfolio; momentum; multivariate F-test; profitability; size","investment; model test; multivariate analysis; numerical model; performance assessment; price determination; profitability; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062235199

The analysis is set in the context of the job demands-resources theory. Design/methodology/approach: The research was undertaken using a case study approach with semi-structured interviews in two London hospitals. Participants included staff from the HR director level, clinical managers and permanent staff who all had an influence in the hiring and management of temporary staff in some way. Transcripts were analysed thematically using an adopted framework approach. Findings: The results indicate that the effect of temporary staff on permanent staff depended on the quality of the “resource”. There was a “hierarchy of preference” for temporary staff based on their familiarity with the context. Those unfamiliar with the department served as a distraction to permanent staff due to the need to “manage” them in various ways. While this was rarely perceived to affect patient safety, it could have an impact on service quality by causing delays and interruptions. In line with previous research, the use of temporary staff also affected perceptions of fairness and the commitment of some permanent staff. Practical implications: A model developing an approach for improved practice when managing temporary staff was developed to minimise the risks to patient safety and service quality, and improve permanent staff morale. Social implications: The review highlights the difficulties that a limited amount of temporary staff integration can have on permanent staff and patient care, indicating that consideration must be placed on how temporary staff are inducted and clarifying expectations of roles for both temporary and permanent staff. Originality/value: This paper studies the under-researched impact of temporary staff, and, distinctively, staff employed on a single shift, on the behaviour and attitudes of permanent staff. It highlights the need to consider carefully the qualitative nature of “resources” in the job demands-resources theory. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Demands and resources; Management; Patient safety and service quality; Permanent staff; Psychological contract; Temporary staff",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061723291

We propose a new approach to predict the point spread in real time using in-game data. The approach uses a snapshot from the current game to identify historical games that have the same snapshot. After identifying these games, we predict the point spread of the current game using information obtained from the historical games. Using data obtained from six seasons of professional basketball games, we compare the prediction error of this approach to that of a deep learning technique, a long short-term memory network, and a general linear model. The proposed approach performs nearly the same as both models without the need for resource-intensive training. We discuss the robustness of this approach for making real-time predictions as games are underway. The findings have real-world implications for game enthusiasts, coaching staffs, and, most importantly, bettors. © Operational Research Society 2019.","data snapshot; long short-term memory network; point spread; professional basketball; Real-time prediction","Basketball; Deep learning; Learning systems; Professional aspects; Basketball games; Data snapshot; General linear modeling; Learning techniques; New approaches; Prediction errors; Real-time prediction; Short term memory; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089199672

In response to such negative impacts, nonprofit community development corporations (CDCs) throughout the United States use various resources, such as grants and lines of credit, in acquiring and redeveloping foreclosed housing units to support neighborhood stabilization and revitalization. Given that the cost of all such acquisitions far exceeds the resources accessible by these nonprofit organizations, we identify socially optimal policies for CDCs for dynamically selecting foreclosed properties to target for potential acquisition as they become available over time. We evaluate our analytical results in a numerical study involving a CDC serving a major city in the United States and specify social return-based thresholds defining selection decisions at different funding levels. We also find that, for most foreclosed properties, CDCs should not offer more than the asking price and should typically consider overbidding only when the total available budget is low. Overall, comparisons of optimal policies with historical acquisition data suggest a potential improvement of around 20% in expected total impacts of the acquisitions on nearby property values. Considering a CDC with annual fund availability of $4 million for investment, this corresponds to an estimated additional value of around $280,000 for the society. © 2019 INFORMS.","foreclosure; nonprofit operations; public policy; public sector; resource allocation","Budget control; Economics; Housing; Public policy; Resource allocation; Analytical results; Economic Recession; foreclosure; Non-profit community; nonprofit operations; Optimal policies; Public sector; Selection decisions; Nonprofit organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071607371

International technology-based new ventures are important for the growth of an abundant economy, yet little is known about how these firms utilise social capital to develop the resources required to initiate these firms. Here, we add to the literature by first defining INVs as firms that establish foreign operations, not just foreign sales. We then empirically demonstrate that social capital acquisition and use affects the development of the resources (capital) needed for the INV development - strategic, financial and managerial. Our results demonstrate that the development of social capital precedes other forms of capital acquisition for INVs. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Abundant economy; International new ventures; Internationalisation; Personal networks; Resource acquisition; Resource development; Social capital","Gold; Mergers and acquisitions; Abundant economy; Internationalisation; New ventures; Personal networks; Resource acquisition; Resource development; Social capitals; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065118914

Nevertheless, does it mean that countries with more democracy are often wealthier? What are the relationships between economic growth and democracy? This research includes 167 countries to study the issue. We employ the data of the democracy index, corruption perception index, inflation, population, number of internet users, balance of trade, foreign direct investment, etc. We have also included sub-indices such as the electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, culture, and civil liberties. An innovative part of the paper is how the corruption perception index has been included in our analysis. Besides, principal component analysis is applied to study the relationship between democracy and economic growth. We conclude that it takes democracy a very long time to affect the macro-economy. The fast pace of change in democracy even harms the macro-economy. If the economy reaches a well-developed stage, the economy will gradually transform into a democratic city automatically in the absence of any external pressure.

Research identifies trust as a major factor in this exchange. It concludes that seller-generated product descriptions can mitigate mistrust. Further, technical and professional communication research can reveal what content sellers tend to provide and can reveal how platform design may encourage that content. Literature review: C2C e-commerce and TPC researchers agree that mistrust can be mitigated by detailed content, and they call for platform designers to help improve platform and seller reputations. Research questions: 1. What content do sellers provide about their technical products? 2. How do the platforms' web form designs and the associated documentation about listing a product for sale encourage certain content types? Research methodology: Four platforms were chosen using specific criteria. Product descriptions were collected once per week for six weeks, generating 1900 product descriptions. These descriptions were unitized and given reliable content categories, a methodology called quantitative content analysis. Further, the documentation and processes for posting items were explored to determine how they may encourage content types. Results/discussion: Sellers mostly provide product information and sales procedures, and they rarely give benefits and goodwill to the buyer. The platform design seems to encourage this content because of the content-entry process, the content-entry options, and the required and unrequired content entry. Conclusions: This study invites technical and professional communicators to provide more guidelines for users about the kinds of content they may include, and designers to explore the content entry process using usability and user-experience research. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Copywriting; e-commerce; technical marketing; user-generated content","Electronic commerce; Professional aspects; Copywriting; Product descriptions; Professional communication; Quantitative content analysis; Research methodologies; Technical marketing; User experience research; User-generated content; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075341577

However, despite capable workers being hired, productivity may suffer if employees’ motivational needs are not satisfied. We developed an agent-based model to simulate the completion of tasks by teams of workers in an organization. Each worker is described by an ability value and a 3-parameter motive profile expressing the individual’s needs for affiliation, achievement, and power. During each time step, each worker contributes to an assigned task at a rate determined by the worker’s ability and motive profile, the task’s difficulty and proximity to completion, and the team’s experience. When a task is completed by a team, the workers are re-assigned to a new team and task. At the end of 365 time steps, the model outputs the total number of completed tasks, which is the primary measurement of productivity. Model simulations demonstrate that hiring workers based on their ability and motivational strengths can lead to increased productivity. Additional model simulations illustrate the benefit of identifying failing tasks and re-assigning new teams to these tasks in real-time. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agent-based models; Motivation theory; Organizational performance; Productivity; Simulation","Computational methods; Motivation; Productivity; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Increased productivity; Model outputs; Model simulation; Motivation theories; Organizational performance; Real time; Simulation; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062974083

Rather, the main benefits of clustering on exporting appear to arise indirectly through investments in innovation and productivity. The main implication of the findings suggests that a better endowed geographical area improves international competitiveness mainly by enhancing the super-additive effects of investments in technology on productivity, which, in turn, enhances exporting performance. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","China; exporting; productivity; R&D; regional clusters","competitiveness; export; industrial investment; innovation; productivity; research and development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073967166

Specifically, list prices are often considerably higher than net prices. PBMs have considerable market power to obtain substantial discounts (rebates) from pharmaceutical companies which encourages higher list prices. In general the generic market works well. At issue is how much of the discounts are passed on to other stakeholders. High prices during market exclusivity or patent protection encourages R&D. Pharmaceuticals spend a large percentage of revenues on R&D, earn large profits which are somewhat overstated and take substantial risk. Many firms never make a profit. Drugs provide great value and increase the quality of life of patients. Since subscribers often change insurance companies, insurers have a shorter time horizon than pharmaceutical firms, which could lead to coverage issues. Policies to mitigate high drug prices include changes to PBM rebate practices, stricter patent approvals and reduction of barriers for generics and biosimilars. © 2019 ThinkBiotech LLC.

Then a produce wholesaler has two sales strategies: (1) unsorted selling (US), i.e. selling the produce to the market at one price and (2) sorted selling (SS), i.e. pre-sorting the produce into different grades by quality and selling them at different prices. When the SS strategy is adopted, the demands of the different grades are uncertain and substitutable. In this paper, we study the joint optimal purchase and sales strategy for selling mixed quality produce to customers with heterogeneous quality preferences. We first derive the optimal purchase policies under the two strategies and then identify the conditions under which the SS or US strategy is optimal. We show that the optimal sales strategy is determined by the marginal purchase and sorting cost and the fixed investment cost, the overall quality level of the produce, and the substitution rate for the high-quality and low-quality produce. This finding differs from the conventional wisdom that the SS strategy is optimal in the produce retail business. Finally, we conduct numerical studies based on real-world data to generate managerial insights from the analytical findings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","demand substitution; inventory management; operations management/marketing interface; Produce; sales strategy","Inventory control; Sales; Sorting; Fruit and vegetables; Inventory management; Investment costs; Operations management; Produce; Sales strategies; Selling strategies; Substitution rates; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059041102

Senior managers are increasingly considering model risk to be one of the most severe vulnerabilities to which a financial institution can be exposed. While the concept seems relatively simple, the definition of model risk (both traditional and regulatory), its origins (from dogma to misuse) and ways to manage it (from engineering conservatism into models to having a proper governance process) are not necessarily handled well by practitioners, academics and regulators. Having a clear definition of model failure and understanding its root causes allow us to adopt the appropriate management style to deal with potential issues that could lead to dramatic failures.

The empirical evidence is based on interactive quantile regressions. Domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism dynamics are employed while development assistance measurements comprised bilateral and multilateral aid variables. With regard to the investigated hypothesis, we consistently confirm that: (i) In quantiles where terrorism is found to increase (decrease) economic growth, its interaction with foreign aid decreases (increases) economic growth. (ii) Comparing thresholds of the modifying aid variables for which the hypothesis is either rejected or accepted reveals that higher levels of multilateral (bilateral) aid are needed to reverse the negative effect of total (unclear) terrorism on growth, than the quantity needed to reverse the positive impact of transnational (domestic and total) terrorism(s) on growth.

The resource-based view suggests that strategic partnerships between firms have the potential to create value when resources are pooled together. Scott Crump faces a decision-making situation wherein he analyses the value-creation potential of the original equipment manufacturer partnership with Hewlett-Packard (HP). In addition, contrasting the cultural environments within both organizations would bring in greater complexity and depth to the reflections, analyses and discussions. Often research experts explore these concepts in isolated streams of research. However, in real-world scenarios, these aspects must be integrated for a more comprehensive decision making to take place. It is also recommended for students to analyze how founder characteristics and resources imprint organizations with certain enduring “imprints” that determine strategic outcomes for the firm in unique ways. Research methodology: For the development of this case, the authors interviewed the top management at Stratasys including Scott Crump, Founder and CEO. The authors also interviewed former and current employees of Stratasys, HP, other experts in the printing industry and existing customers in the 3D printing industry. The company made internal documents available to the authors including financial statements, internal meeting presentations, company forecasts and assessment tools. All interviews were recorded and analyzed to obtain and include multiple perspectives from various stakeholders. The authors also conducted extensive online research on the 3D printing industry and utilized data from news articles, interviews and other relevant press materials. Case overview/synopsis: Scott Crump, Founder of Stratasys, a company that developed and sold 3D printers, had always envisioned a future when it would be commonplace for a 3D printer to be on the desk of every engineer. HP approached him with a proposal that had the potential to make that dream come true. Crump knew that Stratasys did not need to partner with HP for a financial reason, but he loved the idea of the technology becoming a standard method for creating parts universally. The case highlights a true-life account of a firm’s founder considering an important strategic alliance and analyzing the ramifications of taking on or refusing this partnership. Complexity academic level: This case has applications in strategic management and small business management courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels. It also contains critical areas of decision making relevant to an advanced strategic management course that focuses on manufacturing strategy or strategic alliance decision making. This case would be relevant to MBA, Executive MBA or Masters of Science in Accountancy level students as well. Specifically, it is intended for use in courses involving topics such as mergers and strategic partnerships, negotiation and leadership, risk analysis, financial statement analysis, financial modeling and market analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural fit; Decision making; Imprinting; Strategic alliance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079738104

Motivated by a practical case study elicited in the context of a project we recently conducted at Crossrail, we introduce the Dynamic Bowser Routing Problem. In this problem the decision maker aims to dynamically refuel, by dispatching a bowser truck, a set of assets which consume fuel and whose location changes over time; the goal is to ensure that assets do not run out of fuel and that the bowser covers the minimum possible distance. We investigate deterministic and stochastic variants of this problem and introduce effective and scalable mathematical programming models to tackle these cases.

The analysis finds that public decisionmakers strongly favour highly visible nutrition investments and those with a short duration between the time that spending is incurred and outcomes or outputs are achieved. Co-ordination has been quite successful among donors, and mainly of a spatial nature. Co-ordination is significantly weaker among government agencies, given the absence of fiscal tools of the co-ordinating agency, and its placement in a sector ministry rather than at a supra-sectoral level. Champions as change agents have had a truly influential role in attracting more funding to nutrition and improving its allocation.

This paper provides a case study of applying quantitative techniques to improve operations performance for a small contact centre affiliated with a water plant in the USA. By establishing a regression-adjusted queuing model-based virtual benchmarking contact centre, the research focuses on investigating efficiency losses the small contact centre was facing. The study suggests that the overwhelming majority of the efficiency loss at the small contact centre was related to agent shrinkage (unavailable while logged-in or did not log-in). Surprisingly, forecasting and scheduling errors only resulted in a fairly small portion of the overall efficiency loss, which contradicts the traditional belief of 'scheduling dominating call centre performance'. The article offers managerial insights catering to these small contact centres which can help them eliminate waste, reduce operating costs and improve service quality.

In such an environment it is very important that users and applications have some level of assurance that their requirements can be satisfied while trying to optimize the usage of the available resources. This paper presents a new requirementdriven decision making mechanism that is based on a quality assured load balancer for distributed computing systems. We evaluate the approach and demonstrate how it can adapt to user requirements and to the capacity of available resources. © 2016 IEEE.","Analytical hierarchy process; cloud computing; distributed systems; load balancers; quality of service (QoS","Balancing; Cloud computing; Decision making; Quality of service; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Decision-making mechanisms; Distributed computing systems; Distributed infrastructure; Distributed models; Distributed systems; Dynamic environments; Load balancer; Distributed computer systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065673220
