We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","analytical intelligence; artificial intelligence; automation; economics; empathetic intelligence; human intelligence; human resources; intuitive intelligence; machine learning; mechanical intelligence; replacement; robots; service strategy; singularity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041406987

In this endeavour, we employ the novel SOR (Shahbaz et al. 2017) unit root test on French time series data over the period 1955–2016 to examine the order of integration in the presence of sharp and smooth structural breaks in the variables. We also apply the bootstrapping bounds testing approach, recently developed by McNown et al. (2018), to investigate the presence of cointegration and the empirical findings underscore the presence of cointegration among the time series. Moreover, we find that FDI has a positive impact, while energy research innovations have a negative impact, on French carbon emissions. Financial development lowers carbon emissions, thereby improving the French environmental quality. FDI degrades the environment, and thus supports the pollution-haven hypothesis in France. Similarly, financial development suggests that financial stability is a required condition for improving environmental quality, so are energy research innovations. Contrarily, energy consumption is positively linked with carbon emissions. However, the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions is an inverted-U, which is a validation of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Energy research innovations; FDI; Financial development","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy utilization; Investments; Time series; Bounds testing approaches; Carbon emissions; Energy research; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental quality; Financial development; Foreign direct investments; Pollution haven hypothesis; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; financial system; foreign direct investment; innovation; Kuznets curve; time series; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051136715

Its guiding principles are to enhance industrial capability through innovation-driven manufacturing, optimize the structure of Chinese industry, emphasize quality over quantity, train and attract talent, and achieve green manufacturing and environment. Data show that currently China is no longer the lowest–cost labor market; it is being squeezed by newly emerging low-cost producers such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Meanwhile, China is not the strongest player in the high-tech arena; well-established industrialized nations, the US, Germany, and Japan, have all effectively deployed digital technology to create new industrial environments, produce new products, and improve their well-established brands. Having analyzed the data from the World Bank and China's National Bureau of Statistics, we find an upward trajectory in China in manufacturing capability development, research and development commitment, and human capital investment. However, implementing an ambitious strategic plan such as “Made-in-China 2025” is coupled with challenges.

The findings reveal that SNSs’ participation motivations positively influence customer participation, which in turn significantly affects brand trust and brand loyalty. Consequently, both brand trust and brand loyalty positively influence branding co-creation in brand communities on social media. Furthermore, brand trust contributes as a mediator between customer participation and brand loyalty on social media brand communities.

The results of cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity tests confirm the existence of significant cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. The empirical results of the common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimator indicate that, at both the global and regional levels, population size and economic growth positively and significantly influence CO2 emission levels.

We analyze the asset portfolios of different RE technologies financed by different financial actors according to their size, skew and level of risk. We use entropy-based indices to measure skew, and construct a heuristic index of risk that varies with the technology, time, and country of investment to measure risk. We start by comparing the behavior of private and public types of finance and then disaggregate further along 11 different financial actors (e.g. private banks, public banks, and utilities) and 11 types of RE technologies that are invested in (e.g. different kinds of power generation from solar radiation, wind or biomass). Financial actors vary considerably in the composition of their investment portfolio, creating directions towards particular technologies. Public financial actors invest in portfolios with higher risk technologies, also creating a direction; they also increased their share in total investment dramatically over time. We use these preliminary results to formulate new research questions about how finance affects the directionality of innovation, and the implications for RE policies. © 2017 The Authors","Deployment; Direction of innovation; Financial actors; Portfolio approach; Renewable energy finance; Technology risk","Finance; Risk assessment; Deployment; Financial actors; Portfolio approach; Renewable energies; Technology risks; Investments; alternative energy; data set; finance; innovation; investment; renewable resource; risk factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020310123

We focus on the relatively understudied domain of online-first retailers and the engagement of a key omnichannel tactic; specifically, introduction of showrooms (physical locations where customers can view and try products) in combination with online fulfillment that uses centralized inventory management. We ask whether, and if so, how, showrooms benefit the two most basic retail objectives: demand generation and operational efficiency. Using quasi-experimental data on showroom openings by WarbyParker.com, the leading and iconic online-first eyewear retailer, we find that showrooms: (1) increase demand overall and in the online channel as well; (2) generate operational spillovers to the other channels by attracting customers who, on average, have a higher cost-to-serve; (3) improve overall operational efficiency by increasing conversion in a sampling channel and by decreasing returns; and (4) amplify these demand and operational benefits in dealing with customers who have the most acute need for the firm's products. Moreover, the effects we document strengthen with time as showrooms contribute not only to brand awareness but also to what we term channel awareness as well.We conclude by elaborating the underlying customer dynamics driving our findings and by offering implications for how online-first retailers might deploy omnichannel tactics. © 2017 INFORMS.","Experience attributes; Marketing-operations interface; Omnichannel retailing; Quasi-experimental methods; Retail operations; Showrooms","Costs; Efficiency; Inventory control; Experience attributes; Experimental methods; Marketing-operations interfaces; Omnichannel retailing; Retail operations; Showrooms; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045207114

Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms’ operations decisions, financial constraints, and multiple financing channels (bank loans and trade credit), this paper attempts to better understand the risk-sharing role of trade credit—that is, how trade credit enhances supply chain efficiency by allowing the retailer to partially share the demand risk with the supplier. Within this role, in equilibrium, trade credit is an indispensable external source for inventory financing, even when the supplier is at a disadvantageous position in managing default relative to a bank. Specifically, the equilibrium trade credit contract is net terms when the retailer’s financial status is relatively strong. Accordingly, trade credit is the only external source that the retailer uses to finance inventory. By contrast, if the retailer’s cash level is low, the supplier offers two-part terms, inducing the retailer to finance inventory with a portfolio of trade credit and bank loans. Further, a deeper early-payment discount is offered when the supplier is relatively less efficient in recovering defaulted trade credit, or the retailer has stronger market power. Trade credit allows the supplier to take advantage of the retailer’s financial weakness, yet it may also benefit both parties when the retailer’s cash is reasonably high. Finally, using a sample of firm-level data on retailers, we empirically observe the inventory financing pattern that is consistent with what our model predicts. © 2017 INFORMS.","Capital structure; Financial constraint; Inventory management; Newsvendor; Operations–finance interface; Supply chain management; Supply contract; Trade credit","Finance; Inventory control; Risk management; Sales; Supply chain management; Capital structure; Financial constraints; Inventory management; Newsvendors; Supply contracts; Trade credit; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051379086

The barriers that hinder GBTs adoption need detailed investigation. However, few studies have been conducted on the barriers to GBTs adoption in developing countries such as Ghana. This study aims to investigate the critical barriers to GBTs adoption with reference to the Ghanaian construction market. To achieve the objective, 26 barriers were identified from a comprehensive literature review, and a questionnaire survey was performed with 43 professionals with green building experience. The ranking analysis results indicated that 20 barriers were critical. The top three most critical barriers were higher costs of GBTs, lack of government incentives, and lack of financing schemes (e.g., bank loans). A comparative analysis showed that while the most critical barriers to GBTs adoption in the developing country of Ghana mostly vary from those in the developed countries of the US, Canada, and Australia, higher costs of GBTs remains a top barrier in all the countries. Furthermore, factor analysis revealed that the underlying grouped barriers for the 20 critical barriers were government-related, human-related, knowledge and information-related, market-related, and cost and risk-related barriers. This study also showed that the most dominant of the five underlying groups was government-related barriers, which highlights the government's role in promoting GBTs adoption in Ghana. This study adds to the green building literature by analyzing GBTs adoption barriers within the context of a developing country, which could help policy makers and practitioners take suitable measures to mitigate the barriers and thereby promote the GBTs adoption. Future research will investigate the interrelationships between the critical barriers and their impacts on the GBTs adoption activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Construction market; Developing countries; Ghana; Green building technologies; Sustainability","Buildings; Commerce; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Developing countries; Risk assessment; Surveys; Sustainable development; Barriers; Comparative analysis; Construction markets; Ghana; Government incentive; Green buildings; Questionnaire surveys; Sustainability issues; Construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038824554

To do this, we build on the concept of National Systems of Entrepreneurship (NSE) as resource allocation systems that combine institutions and human agency into an interdependent system of complementarities. We explore the empirical relevance of these ideas using data from a representative global survey and institutional sources for 46 countries over the period 2002–2011.

However, relatively little research has been conducted on the extent to which firms have integrated social sustainability aspects into the management of their supply chains in emerging economies. The purpose of this article is to explore the social issues pertinent to suppliers and to identify measures and dimensions related to social sustainability in emerging economies. Further, it explores the benefits suppliers and buyers gain by effectively managing such social issues. For this purpose, first, in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 supply chain managers. Further, a survey was conducted in Indian manufacturing industries and co-variance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. The findings reveal that there are 18 validated supplier social sustainability measures underlying five social dimensions: labor rights, safety and health, societal responsibility, diversity, and product responsibility. The results also suggest a positive relationship between supplier social sustainability practices and supply chain performance mediated by supplier performance. In addition, the role of the buyer's commitment and investment moderates both suppliers and supply chain performance. These results are relevant because they not only identify the social issues plaguing supply chains in emerging economies, but also have practical implications for organizations trying to build socially sustainable supply chains for competitive advantage. © 2017","Social sustainability; Supplier social sustainability; Supply chain management; Supply chain sustainability; Sustainability in emerging economies","Competition; Economics; Social aspects; Supply chain management; Competitive advantage; Emerging economies; Manufacturing industries; Social sustainability; Structural equation modeling; Supplier performance; Supply chain performance; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032670346

A cointegration analysis is conducted over the period 1992–2013. For getting more robust results, Johansen, ARDLBT, DOLS, FMOLS and CCR methods are employed to explore cointegration and estimate long-run coefficients. We use cubic, quadratic and linear specifications and conclude that the last one is an adequate representation for the impact of the economic growth on CO2 emissions in Azerbaijan. The results from the different cointegration methods are consistent with each other and show that the economic growth has a positive and statistically significant impact on the emissions in the long-run implying that the EKC hypothesis does not hold for Azerbaijan. The income elasticity of CO2 emissions, using different methods, is found to be between 0.7 and 0.8. Moreover, we find that any short-run imbalance can be adjusted towards the long-run equilibrium path within less than one year. The paper concludes that measures to increase energy efficiency, carbon pricing instruments in production and international-domestic trade activities, and nationwide social awareness programs to instruct about the negative consequences of pollution can be considered as relevant environmental policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Azerbaijan; CO2 emissions; Cointegration; Economic growth; EKC hypothesis","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Azerbaijan; CO2 emissions; Cointegration; Economic growths; EKC hypothesis; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052614927

However, environmental sustainability is far wider than carbon emissions and climate change. This review aims to highlight the importance of considering air pollutants in optimisation studies and evaluate the limitation of the current assessments for air emissions, particularly in relation to transportation. The source of air pollutants is firstly overviewed with special attention on non-stationary sources, freight and sea transportation. The type of measurement to obtain the emission data and the available optimisation models on transport mode choice selection were then summarised. The strengths and Weaknesses' have been indicated. The identified gap includes greenhouse gas and air pollutants not being evaluated simultaneously and the interaction between the different pollutants are not being adequately considered. A better assessment framework and impact categories classification are consequently required. The summarised assessment model of transportation mode choice shows that the current viewpoint on low emissions, green or environmental sustainability options refers to carbon dioxide as a part of greenhouse gas. Attention towards a better emission assessment and management has been supported in this study through critical discussion. The next step of this work is to develop a methodology to measure greenhouse gas and air pollutants simultaneously by considering the synergistic effect and the discussed limitation. It is important for minimising the potential of footprint shifting and poor decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Emissions assessment; Greenhouse gas; Transportation; Transportation mode choice","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Transportation; Air pollutants; Critical discussions; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Non-stationary sources; Optimisation models; Transport mode choices; Transportation mode; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053085541

We test our model using data collected from large firms in the US. The results provide strong support for our model. We found that firms with superior IS capabilities coupled with an aggressive IT investment orientation create digital platforms that enable them to be agile. We also found that the innovation capacity of the firm has a positive relationship with organizational agility and that firms with higher innovation capacity are better able to leverage their digital platforms to enhance agility.

On the one hand, such platforms may reduce entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, such platforms may enable entrepreneurial activity by offering work flexibility that allows the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in order to pursue the nascent venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of the ridesharing platform Uber X into local areas. We use two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter, the world's largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests primarily amongst unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. These relationships are corroborated with a first-hand survey conducted with gig-economy service providers. © 2018 INFORMS.","Crowdfunding; Difference in difference; Digital platforms; Entrepreneurship; Gig economy; Necessity-based entrepreneurship","Crowdsourcing; Surveys; Crowdfunding; Difference-in-differences; Digital platforms; Entrepreneurship; Gig economy; Necessity-based entrepreneurship; Employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053740575

The new focus on sustainability performance objectives emphasizes the effective utilization and consumption of natural resources to balance ecological, economic and societal aspects of agri-food businesses. The management of sustainability adds a new demand on business managers who often have small profits and receive stringent requirements from large powerful customers and retailers. In this paper, we recognize and analyze the key enablers in implementing sustainable initiatives for Agri-Food Supply Chains (A-FSCs). Ten important sustainability driven enablers were considered from a rigorous literature review and phase of expert consultation. The identified enablers were then analyzed using a combined Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) - fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based framework. The ISM approach enabled an appreciation of the contextual relationships among the enablers and to classify the enablers based on their driving and dependence potential. The fuzzy DEMATEL technique supported the determination of the influential and influenced enablers and also to categorize them into cause and effect groups. An empirical case study, drawn from a vegetable and fruit retail supply chain in India, is used to focus and test the applicability of the proposed research framework. The paper facilitates professional management practice and researchers to uncover and explore the enablers for the real execution of sustainability oriented initiatives in the agri-food business sector. © 2018","Agri-food supply chain; Enablers; Fuzzy DEMATEL; India; ISM-MICMAC; Sustainable initiatives","Agriculture; Decision making; Food supply; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Agri-food supply chains; Enablers; Fuzzy dematel; India; ISM-MICMAC; Sustainable initiatives; Food safety",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053057185

We have used the dynamic capability view (DCV) to conceptualize our theoretical models for different phases of humanitarian supply chain (HSC) (pre and post-disaster phases). We used partial least squares (PLS) to examine the proposed research hypotheses using 335 responses gathered from organizations in India using questionnaires designed for a single respondent. The results suggest that SCAG and SCRES are two important dynamic capabilities of supply chain, have significant effects on pre-disaster performance (PRE-DP). The control orientation does not have significant effect on the path joining SCAG and PRE-DP. However, the control orientation has a significant interaction effect on the path joining SCRES and PRE-DP. Similarly, SCRES has significant effect on post-disaster performance (POST-DP) but SCAG has no significant effect on POST-DP. In contrast, the flexible orientation has significant moderation effects on the paths SCAG/SCRES and POST-DP. These findings contribute to our understanding of the differential effect of SCAG/SCRES on supply chain performance in different contexts. The results provide further understanding to develop appropriate strategies for different phases.

Using data from Amazon.com to study Amazon's entry pattern into third-party sellers' product spaces, we find that Amazon is more likely to target successful product spaces. We also find that Amazon is less likely to enter product spaces that require greater seller efforts to grow, suggesting that complementors' platform-specific investments influence platform owners' entry decisions. While Amazon's entry discourages affected third-party sellers from subsequently pursuing growth on the platform, it increases product demand and reduces shipping costs for consumers. We consider the implications of these findings for complementors in platform-based markets. Managerial Summary: Platform owners can exert considerable influence over their complementors' welfare. Many complementors with successful products are pushed out of markets because platform owners enter their product spaces and compete directly with them. To mitigate such risks, complementors could build their businesses by aggregating nonblockbuster products or focusing on products requiring significant platform-specific investments to grow. They should also develop capabilities in new product discovery so that they could continually bring innovative products to their platforms. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Amazon; co-opetition; complementor; entry; platform-based markets","Commerce; Amazon; Co-opetition; complementor; entry; Innovative product; Product demand; Specific investment; Third parties; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052785591

Some studies have focused on specific contexts and pockets of good practice. This exploratory, survey-based study of 77 companies investigates the shift towards the CE using a taxonomy of practices and barriers. Results show that firms favour practices related to resource and energy utilisation efficiency, while practices related to investment recovery, green purchasing and customer cooperation are less prevalent. Eco-design and internal environmental management practices have a medium level of implementation. The significant upfront investment cost, lack of awareness or sense of urgency were identified as implementation barriers.

A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life.

One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design. A particularly challenging aspect in this context is the broad range of influencing indicators associated with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability that need to be considered. However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from an agro-food company to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology. The analyzes of the numerical results provide important organizational, practical and policy insights on (1) the impact of financial and environmental sustainability on supply chain network design (2) the tradeoff analysis between environmental emission, water footprint, societal implications and associated cost for making informed decision on supply chain investment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-food supply chain design; Analytical hierarchy process; Decision-making; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Carbon footprint; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Design; Food supply; Multiobjective optimization; Supply chains; Agro foods; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Analytical Hierarchy Process; Environmental sustainability; Hybrid solution methodology; Multi criteria decision making; Multi objective decision making; Supply chain network design; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010999493

This freeriding behavior by customers is referred to as ""showrooming,"" and we show that this is detrimental to the profits of the brick-and-mortar stores. We first analyze price matching as a short-term strategy to counter showrooming. Price matching allows customers to purchase a product from the store for less than the store's posted price, so one would expect the price matching strategy to be less effective as the fraction of customers who seek the matching increases. However, our results show that with an increase in the fraction of customers who seek price matching, the store's profits initially decrease and then increase. While price matching could be used even when customers do not exhibit showrooming behavior, we find that it is more effective when customers do showrooming. We then study exclusivity of product assortments as a long-termstrategy to counter showrooming. This strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (1) by arranging for exclusivity of known brands (e.g., Macy's has such an arrangement with Tommy Hilfiger) or (2) through the creation of store brands at the brick-and-mortar store (T. J. Maxx sells a large number of store brands). Our analysis suggests that implementing exclusivity through store brands is better than exclusivity through known brands when the product category has few digital attributes. However, when customers do not showroom, the known-brand strategy dominates the store-brand strategy. © 2017 INFORMS.","Competitive strategy; Customer behavior; Game theory; Online retailing; Pricing; Retail competition; Showrooming","Brick; Costs; Game theory; Mortar; Profitability; Competitive strategy; Customer behavior; Online retailing; Retail competition; Showrooming; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049391889

Air pollution has drawn increasing attention at home and abroad. However, the potential negative impacts of environmental pollution on economic development have long been ignored. Considering the possible effect of economic growth on environmental pollution, the conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation may suffer from endogeneity biases caused by possible bilateral causality. In this paper, using city-level panel data for the period between 2013 and 2015, the influence of PM2.5 concentrations on per capita GDP is estimated through a carefully designed simultaneous equations model for the first time. To control for fixed effects, a series of time dummies and region dummies are also introduced. The estimation results indicate that haze pollution indeed has a significantly negative impact on economic development. On average, as of 2015, when other conditions are equal, an increase of 5 μg/m3 in PM2.5 concentrations may cause a decrease of approximately 2500 yuan in GDP per capita. In addition, the results suggest that sustainable economic growth may help reduce PM2.5 concentrations, which in turn benefits economic development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Chinese cities; Economic development; PM2.5 concentrations; Simultaneous equations model","Air pollution; Economics; Chinese cities; Economic growths; Environmental pollutions; Estimation results; Ordinary least squares; PM2.5 concentration; Simultaneous equations model; Sustainable economic growth; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038850264

Online reviews also provide additional value to online retailers, as they attract consumers. Therefore, identifying the most-helpful reviews is an important task for online retailers. This research addresses the problem of predicting the helpfulness of online product reviews by developing a comprehensive research model guided by the theoretical foundations of signaling theory. Thereby, our research model posits that the reviewer of a product sends signals to potential buyers. Using a sample of Amazon.com product reviews, we test our model and observe that review content-related signals (i.e., specific review content and writing styles) and reviewer-related signals (i.e., reviewer expertise and non-anonymity) both influence review helpfulness. Furthermore, we find that the signaling environment affects the signal impact and that incentives provided to reviewers influence the signals sent. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our results, we illustrate by means of a problem-specific evaluation scenario that our model provides superior predictions of review helpfulness compared to earlier approaches. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed evaluation scenario provides deeper insights than classical performance metrics. Our findings are highly relevant for online retailers seeking to reduce information overload and consumers' search costs as well as for reviewers contributing online product reviews. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer decision making; Content analysis; Helpfulness; Online review; Signaling theory","Decision making; Decision theory; Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Consumer decision making; Content analysis; Helpfulness; Online reviews; Signaling theory; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042146050

To obtain exogenous variation in firms’ social engagement, I exploit a quasi-natural experiment provided by the enactment of state-level constituency statutes, which allow directors to consider stakeholders’ interests when making business decisions. Using constituency statutes as instrumental variable (IV) for CSR, I find that companies with higher CSR receive more procurement contracts. The effect is stronger for more complex contracts and in the early years of the government-company relationship, suggesting that CSR helps mitigate information asymmetries by signaling trustworthiness. Moreover, the effect is stronger in competitive industries, indicating that CSR can serve as a differentiation strategy to compete against other bidders. Managerial Summary: This study examines how companies can strategically improve their competitiveness in the market for government procurement contracts—a market of economic importance (15–20% of GDP). It shows that companies with higher social and environmental performance (CSR) receive more procurement contracts. This effect is stronger for more complex contracts, in the early years of the government–company relationship, and in more competitive industries. These findings indicate that firms’ CSR can serve as a signaling and differentiation strategy that influences the purchasing decision of government agencies. Accordingly, managers operating in the business-to-government (B2G) sector could benefit from integrating social and environmental considerations into their strategic decision making.

The process helps in prioritising risks and strategies specific to the decision maker's risk appetite. The process is demonstrated through a case study conducted in a global manufacturing supply chain involving semi-structured interviews and focus group sessions with experts in risk management. Theoretically grounded in the framework of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) and Expected Utility Theory (EUT), the modelling approach has a number of distinctive characteristics. It utilises a top-down approach of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Performance measures are identified first and subsequently connected to risks. A ‘probability-conditional expected utility’ matrix is introduced to reflect the propagation impact of interdependent risks on all performance measures identified. A ‘weighted net evaluation of risk mitigation’ method is proposed and the method of 'swing weights’ is used to capture the trade-off between the efficacy of strategies and the associated cost keeping in view the decision maker's risk appetite. The approach adapts and integrates techniques from safety and reliability engineering (FTA), decision making under uncertainty (EUT), and multi-criteria decision analysis (swing weights).

The model also accommodates a carbon tax with tax rate uncertainty. The proposed model is a three-stage hybrid robust/stochastic program that combines probabilistic scenarios for the demands and return quantities with uncertainty sets for the carbon tax rates. The first stage decisions are facility investments, the second stage concerns the plan for distributing new and collecting returned products after realization of demands and returns, and the numbers of transportation units of various modes are the third stage decisions. The second- and third-stage decisions may adjust to the realization of the carbon tax rate. For computational tractability, we restrict them to be affine functions of the carbon tax rate. Benders cuts are generated using recent duality developments for robust linear programs. Computational results show that adjusting product flows to the tax rate provides negligible benefit, but the ability to adjust transportation mode capacities can substitute for building additional facilities as a way to respond to carbon tax uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Affinely adjustable robust counterpart; Benders decomposition; Closed-loop supply chain; Scenario-based optimization; Semi-definite programming","Investments; Linear programming; Product design; Stages; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Transportation; Affinely-adjustable robust counterpart; Benders decomposition; Closed-loop supply chain; Scenario-based; Semi-definite programming; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032020704

Especially in developing economies, traditional financing methods can be very costly or unavailable to such suppliers. To reduce channel costs, large buyers have recently begun implementing their own financing methods that intermediate between suppliers and financing institutions. In this paper, we analyze the role and efficiency of buyer intermediation in supplier financing. Building a game-theoretical model, we show that buyer intermediated financing can significantly improve channel performance, and can simultaneously benefit both supply chain participants. Using data from a large Chinese online retailer and through structural regression estimation, we demonstrate that buyer intermediation lowers interest rates and wholesale prices, increases order fill rates, and boosts supplier borrowing. Based on counterfactual analysis on the data, we predict that the implementation of buyer intermediated financing will improve channel profits by 13.05%, increasing supplier and retailer profits by more than 10% each, and yielding approximately $44 million projected savings for the retailer. © 2017 INFORMS.","Empirical analysis; Game theory; Inventory and procurement; Supply chain finance","Game theory; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Developing economies; Empirical analysis; Financing methods; Game theoretical models; Inventory and procurement; Structural regression; Supply chain finances; Whole sale prices; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052956648

Disaster management attracts many organisations working alongside each other and sharing resources to cope with an emergency. Consequently, successful operations rely heavily on the collaboration of different organisations. Despite this, there is little research considering the appropriate management of resources from multiple organisations, and none optimising the number of actors required to avoid shortages or convergence. This research introduces a disaster preparedness system based on a combination of multi-objective optimisation and geographical information systems to aid multi-organisational decision-making. A cartographic model is used to avoid the selection of floodable facilities, informing a bi-objective optimisation model used to determine the location of emergency facilities, stock prepositioning, resource allocation and relief distribution, along with the number of actors required to perform these activities. The real conditions of the flood of 2013 in Acapulco, Mexico, provided evidence of the inability of any single organisation to cope with the situation independently. Moreover, data collected showed the unavailability of enough resources to manage a disaster of that magnitude at the time. The results highlighted that the number of government organisations deployed to handle the situation was excessive, leading to high cost without achieving the best possible level of satisfaction. The system proposed showed the potential to achieve better performance in terms of cost and level of service than the approach currently employed by the authorities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Disaster preparedness; Humanitarian logistics; Multiple objective programming; OR in disaster relief","Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Emergency services; Floods; Geographic information systems; Logistics; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Resource allocation; Societies and institutions; Cartographic models; Collaborative approach; Disaster preparedness; Disaster relief; Humanitarian logistics; Level of satisfaction; Multiple objective programming; Relief distribution; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010526772

We find that scholars have largely focused on individual ecosystem elements and characteristics, eschewing strategic and systemic conceptualizations of entrepreneurship ecosystems. As a result, we argue that the ecosystem perspective has not been fully leveraged to influence policy decisions.

Developing affective commitment and intrinsic motivation is highlighted as a key to organizational success and employee satisfaction. The Solution: In this article, we review our applications of self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2017) concerning how organizations can both assess and build a culture of high-quality motivation. We review a continuum of types of motivation in the workplace that range from passive or controlled compliance to personal valuing of and intrinsic interest in one’s work. We then discuss how support for employees’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness leads to these higher quality types of motivation. Evidence shows that enhanced need satisfaction can come from managerial climate, job design, and well-crafted compensation strategies, as well as being influenced by the perceived mission of the company. A focus on basic needs provides a practical basis for leveraging positive change and achieving goals from talent retention to workplace wellness. The Stakeholders: This article was written to help both researchers and practitioners in HRD (i.e., organizational leaders, human resource professionals, managers) learn the basic principles and applications of SDT as a means of unlocking a more practical and actionable model for engagement and motivation. This review not only translates SDT into practice, opening opportunity for collaboration between researchers and practitioners, but also provides meaningful insight into sustained employee motivation and engagement, job satisfaction, and productivity. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","employee engagement; employee experience; human resource development; motivation; performance management; productivity; retention; self-determination theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046759905

Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system.We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics of each region.","Carbon emissions; Electricity pricing policies; Renewable energy investment","Costs; Economics; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Taxation; Wind power; Carbon emissions; Electricity generation; Electricity pricing; Generation patterns; Market characteristics; Renewable energy investments; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041412048

The evidential reasoning (ER) rule provides a process for dealing with this type of MADM problems of both a quantitative and qualitative nature of uncertainty. In this paper, the ER rule is generalized to dealing with MADM problems in group decision making circumstance where the weights and reliabilities of both experts and attributes are considered. Specifically, the result and process aggregation based ER rules for MADM in group decision making are given respectively, followed by the comparative analysis on the given aggregations. The ER analytical rule for group MADM problems is also provided for the generalization of the ER analytical approach where group decision making is not considered. It is also a development of Yang's ER rule which is a recursive calculation process.

A multiple case example of three automotive companies operating in India is conducted. To the end, some important policy measures and recommendations are proposed to help practicing managers and government bodies to adopt and effectively manage the concepts of sustainability oriented supply chains in India. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automotive sector; competitive advantage; Critical success factors; Grey-DEMATEL; India; supply chain management; sustainability initiatives","Automotive industry; Competition; Decision making; Supply chain management; Automotive sector; Competitive advantage; Critical success factor; DEMATEL; India; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044273163

Because this is a relatively new phenomenon, little is known about how ESM facilitate employee socialization. In order to contribute to our understanding of how ESM affects employee socialization, this paper invokes a case study to explore how one organization's implementation of an ESM for its IT new hire program influenced the socialization process and outcomes. To delve deeply into how the ESM influences socialization, we draw upon technology affordance theory to uncover the various first and second-order affordances actualized by different actor groups and the various outcomes resulting from the affordances. We then identify five generative mechanisms – bureaucracy circumvention, executive perspective, personal development, name recognition, and morale booster – that explain how the actualization of different strands of affordances by various groups of users produces eight different outcomes. Our results provide insights into the different affordances made possible by ESM in the context of a new hire socialization program and how these affordances have repercussions beyond those experienced by the individuals using the ESM. The results have important implications for new hire socialization and technology affordance research. © 2018 The Authors","Enterprise social media; Generative mechanisms; Organizational socialization; Technology affordances","Personnel; Social networking (online); Affordance theories; Generative mechanism; Name recognition; Organizational socialization; Personal development; Second orders; Social media; Technology affordances; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048155607

Growth in marine protected areas, fisheries management, the blue economy, and marine spatial planning initiatives are occurring both within and beyond national jurisdictions. This mounting activity has coincided with increasing concerns about sustainability and international attention to ocean governance. Yet, despite growing concerns about exclusionary decision-making processes and social injustices, there remains inadequate attention to issues of social justice and inclusion in ocean science, management, governance and funding. In a rapidly changing and progressively busier ocean, we need to learn from past mistakes and identify ways to navigate a just and inclusive path towards sustainability. Proactive attention to inclusive decision-making and social justice is needed across key ocean policy realms including marine conservation, fisheries management, marine spatial planning, the blue economy, climate adaptation and global ocean governance for both ethical and instrumental reasons. This discussion paper aims to stimulate greater engagement with these critical topics.

In two additional experiments, we identify three means of reducing this bias: Through additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support), through evidence that African American founders have succeeded previously, and by removing indicators of the founder's race. © 2017 INFORMS.","Crowdfunding; Economic discrimination; Entrepreneurship; Inequality","Operations research; Additional experiments; African American; Crowdfunding; Entrepreneurship; Inequality; Media attention; Perceived quality; Resource providers; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049386094

We apply DEA to capture the flexibility of environmental regulations. Our results indicate that innovation capabilities significantly influence financial performance of firms if firms feel that the environmental regulations they face are flexible and offer more freedom in meeting the requirements of regulations.

While understanding public opinions about autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a compelling step towards their successful implementation, still little is known about to which extent people will embrace this new technology and how the vehicle features will affect their adoption decision. This study presents a new approach for modeling the adoption behavior of fully AVs using the profile-case best-worst scaling model. In this approach, an AV profile which is characterized in terms of the main vehicle attributes and their associated levels is presented to the decision maker and he/she is asked to select the most and the least attractive attributes. Further, a binary adoption question at the end of the choice task inquires if the respondent is willing to purchase the described AV. Utilizing this method, we can recognize the difference between the intrinsic impacts of the vehicle attributes and the impact of the attribute levels on the adoption decision. Results of the analysis indicate that people are much more sensitive to the purchase price and incentive policies such as taking liability away from the “driver” in case of accidents and provision of exclusive lanes for AVs compared to other factors such as fuel efficiency, safety, or environmental friendliness. Further, it is found that millennials with higher income, those who live in the downtown area, and the majority of people who have experienced an accident in the past have greater interests in adopting this technology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption behavior; Autonomous vehicles; Best-worst analysis; Heterogeneity in means; Stated preference survey","Accidents; Behavioral research; Decision making; Adoption behavior; Autonomous mobilities; Best-worst analysis; Environmental friendliness; Heterogeneity in means; Incentive policies; Stated preference surveys; Transportation system; Autonomous vehicles; adoption behavior; autonomous underwater vehicle; heterogeneity; technology adoption; transport vehicle; transportation system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049500451

Empirical evidence has been mixed, and there remain gaps in the literature. The majority of FDI has been directed at developed countries. Single-country studies are needed, due to the heterogeneous relationship between FDI and growth, and because the impact of FDI on growth is said to be largest in open, advanced developed countries with an educated workforce and developed financial markets (although research has focused on developing countries). We fill these gaps with an improved empirical methodology to check whether FDI has enhanced growth in Spain, one of the largest receivers of FDI, whose gross domestic product growth was above average but has escaped scrutiny. During the observation period 1984–2010, FDI rose significantly, and Spain offered ideal conditions for FDI to unfold its hypothesized positive effects on growth. We run a horse race between various potential explanatory variables, including the neglected role of bank credit for the real economy. The results are robust and clear: The favorable Spanish circumstances yield no evidence for FDI to stimulate economic growth.

Understanding public opinion can help improve decision making. Opinion mining is a way of retrieving information via search engines, blogs, microblogs and social networks. Individual opinions are unique to each person, and Twitter tweets are an invaluable source of this type of data. However, the huge volume and unstructured nature of text/opinion data pose a challenge to analyzing the data efficiently. Accordingly, proficient algorithms/computational strategies are required for mining and condensing tweets as well as finding sentiment bearing words. Most existing computational methods/models/algorithms in the literature for identifying sentiments from such unstructured data rely on machine learning techniques with the bag-of-word approach as their basis. In this work, we use both unsupervised and supervised approaches on various datasets. Unsupervised approach is being used for the automatic identification of sentiment for tweets acquired from Twitter public domain. Different machine learning algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines are applied for sentiment identification of tweets as well as to examine the effectiveness of various feature combinations. In our experiment on tweets, we achieve an accuracy of 80.68% using the proposed unsupervised approach, in comparison to the lexicon based approach (the latter gives an accuracy of 75.20%). In our experiments, the supervised approach where we combine unigram, bigram and Part-of-Speech as feature is efficient in finding emotion and sentiment of unstructured data. For short message services, using the unigram feature with MNB classifier allows us to achieve an accuracy of 67%. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bag-of-words; Laplace smoothing; Lexicon; Machine learning; Parts-of-Speech (POS); Sentiment analysis","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Data mining; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Search engines; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Bag of words; Emotion analysis; Laplace smoothing; Lexicon; Part Of Speech; Part-of-speech; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Unstructured data; Unsupervised approaches; Sentiment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017106508

To attain sustainable competitive advantage from big data, firms must achieve agility in combining rich data across the organization to deploy analytics that sense and respond to customers in a dynamic environment. A key challenge in achieving this agility lies in the identification, collection, and integration of data across functional silos both within and outside the organization. Because it is infeasible to systematically integrate all available data, managers need guidance in finding which data can provide valuable and actionable insights about customers. Leveraging relationship marketing theory, we develop a framework for identifying and evaluating various sources of big data in order to create a value-justified data infrastructure that enables focused and agile deployment of advanced customer analytics. Such analytics move beyond siloed transactional customer analytics approaches of the past and incorporate a variety of rich, relationship-oriented constructs to provide actionable and valuable insights. We develop a customized kernel-based learning method to take advantage of these rich constructs and instantiate the framework in a novel prototype system that accurately predicts a variety of customer behaviors in a challenging environment, demonstrating the framework’s ability to drive significant value.

We find that, using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms between 2000 and 2005, intensified market competition has an overall negative impact on firms’ environmental performance. The negative impact is exacerbated in firms adopting a cost-leadership strategy, but is attenuated in those adopting a differentiation strategy. The results emphasize the importance of including an examination of the particular competitive strategies chosen by firms in seeking to understand the impact of intensified market competition. Managerial Summary: Advocates of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have long argued for the differentiation role of CSR. However, managers may be misguided if the assumed benefits of differentiation critically depend on certain presumptions. In the Chinese context and focusing on the environmental dimension of CSR, our study finds a negative relationship between market competition and corporate environmental performance. It suggests that firms, to a large extent, cannot escape competition via environmental differentiation. Managers should therefore be cautious about the value of strategic investment in CSR as a viable competitive device. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","corporate social responsibility (CSR); cost leadership; differentiation; environmental performance; market competition","Commerce; Differentiation (calculus); Environmental management; Investments; Managers; Competitive strategy; Corporate environmental performance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Differentiation strategies; Environmental performance; Manufacturing firms; Market competition; Strategic investments; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053516535

Although there is still considerable technological, economic and behavioural uncertainty, exploration of how the potential rollout may take place both spatially and temporally is required for effective policy formulation. Consequently, the cost, coverage and rollout implications of 5G networks across Britain are explored by extrapolating 4G LTE and LTE-Advanced characteristics for the period 2020–2030. We focus on ubiquitous ultrafast broadband of 50 Mbps and test the impact of annual capital intensity, infrastructure sharing and reducing the end-user speed in rural areas to either 10 or 30 Mbps. For the business-as-usual scenario we find that 90% of the population is covered with 5G by 2027, but coverage is unlikely to reach the final 10% due to exponentially increasing costs. Moreover, varying annual capital intensity or deploying a shared small cell network can greatly influence the time taken to reach the 90% threshold, with these changes mostly benefiting rural areas. Importantly, simply by integrating new and existing spectrum, a network capable of achieving 10 Mbps per rural user is possible, which is comparable to the UK's current fixed broadband Universal Service Obligation. We contribute to the literature by quantifying the effectiveness of the spatial and temporal rollout of 5G under different policy options. © 2017 The Authors","5G; Cost modelling; Infrastructure sharing; Spatial rollout","4G mobile communication systems; Costs; Decision making; Rural areas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Business-as-usual; Cost modelling; Fixed broadbands; Infrastructure sharing; Policy formulation; Small cell Networks; Spatial rollout; Universal service; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026327343

We reconcile this apparent paradox by formalizing whether and when firms—consisting of resource bundles and deriving competitive advantage from exploiting selected VRI resources—may maximize profitability by opening parts of their resource base. As such, our article refines RBV-related thinking while supporting the theory's core tenets. Notably, we illustrate how a common-pool resource can become a source of competitive advantage and how firms may use openness to shape inter-firm competition. Managerial Summary: Conventional wisdom holds that firms must control scarce and valuable resources to obtain competitive advantage. That being said, over the past decade, many firms—among them Computer Associates, IBM, and Nokia—embarked on open strategies and made parts of their valuable resources available for free. These decisions pose an obvious conundrum, which we solve in our article. We use a mathematical model, grounded in principles of the resource-based view, to show why and under what conditions open strategies will succeed. Firms significantly improve their performance when (a) opening resources reduces their cost base while (b) strongly increasing demand for their still-proprietary resource(s). We also explain how openness can reshape markets by weakening competitors, particularly in highly rivalrous environments.

The loss of ecosystem services is particularly challenging in rapid urbanization areas where economic development needs to consume substantial natural resources. The quantitative and spatial optimization of land use provides an effective tool for rationally allocating land use structure and pattern to ensure the provision of expected ecosystem services. In this paper, we combine the Multi-Objective Programming and the Dyna-CLUE model to project land use changes in 2030 for Wuhan city under three scenarios, i.e., Business As Usual (BAU), Rapid Economic Development (RED), and Ecological Land Protection (ELP). The coupled model that integrates “top-down” and “bottom-up” processes is capable of obtaining the optimized land use patterns under different scenarios and examining the potential impacts of land use changes on ecosystem services in a spatially explicit way. We find that built-up land will continue its remarkable growth during 2015-2030 under the BAU scenario (grows by 96%) at the expense of ecological lands (decreases by 18%). Meanwhile, the predicted losses of ecological lands are 11% and 6% under the RED and ELP scenarios, respectively. Projected land use changes result in varying magnitudes of declines in ecosystem service values for BAU (11%), RED (6%) and ELP (2%) scenarios from 2015 to 2030. The ELP scenario, which incorporates ecological protection policies and spatial restrictions, plays a positive role in altering land use trends and mitigating ecosystem degradation. Finally, we establish an ecosystem service value change matrix to explain how interactions between land use types give rise to trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services. We find that conversions between ecological land use types can trigger trade-offs among ecosystem services, but the conversion from ecological lands towards urban land leads to a net loss of all individual ecosystem services. By linking land and ecological systems, the coupled modeling framework in this study can be useful for obtaining optimal ecosystem-based land use allocation strategies and provide scientific support for sustainable land use management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dyna-CLUE model; Ecosystem services trade-offs; Multi-Objective Programming (MOP); Multiple scenario analysis; Spatial allocation; Structural optimization","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Land use; Multiobjective optimization; Structural optimization; Ecological protection; Economic development; Ecosystem degradation; Ecosystem service values; Multiobjective programming; Scenario analysis; Spatial allocation; Trade off; Ecosystems; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; future prospect; land use change; model; numerical method; optimization; prediction; scenario analysis; spatial analysis; trade-off; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049737773

We further find that regulatory focus (i.e. promotion-focus versus prevention-focus) has profound impacts on perceptions and the constructs of the theory of planned behavior. Promotion-focused respondents are more sensitive to perceived environmental benefits and more easily to form positive attitudes toward EV purchase, whereas the prevention-focused respondents are not.

To gain a deeper understanding of these strategies, their applicability and interrelatedness, we analyze how 10 organizations have achieved CESE. Our findings show that CESE can be achieved through three core strategies. First, a dual culture strategy provides a comprehensive set of high-quality services at low cost, largely driven by leadership ambidexterity and contextual ambidexterity. Second, an operations management approach reduces process variability and thereby allows the increased use of systems and technology to achieve CESE. Third, a focused service factory strategy can enable CESE through a highly specialized operation, typically delivering a single type of service to a highly focused customer segment.

The main contributions of this study are two-fold. First, this paper provides valuable support for SSSCM regarding the nature of network hierarchical relations with qualitative and quantitative scales. Second, this study indicates the practical implementation and enhances management effectiveness for SSSCM. The literature on SSSCM is very limited and performance measures need to have a systematic framework. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the SSSCM importance based on aspects i.e., environmentally conscious design, environmental service operations design and environmentally sustainable design. This paper developed a hierarchical network for SSSCM in a closed-loop hierarchical structure. A generalized quantitative evaluation model based on the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Analytical Network Process were then used to consider both the interdependence among measures and the fuzziness of subjective measures in SSSCM. The results indicate that the top-ranking aspect to consider is that of environmental service operation design, and the top criteria is reverse logistics integrated into service package © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Analytical network process; Fuzzy Delphi method (FDM); Fuzzy set theory; Sustainable design; Sustainable service supply chain management","Decision making; Ecodesign; Fuzzy set theory; Logistics; Sustainable development; Analytical network process; Environmental services; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Hierarchical relations; Hierarchical structures; Management effectiveness; Quantitative evaluation models; Sustainable services; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994806809

In contrast to the large amount of literature focusing on green design and green production practices, this paper pays close attention to the sustainable management practice at the bottom of the supply chain by researching sustainable recycling partner evaluation from the economic, environmental and social perspectives. To develop a feasible analytical framework for recycling partner selection, the fuzzy-based technology is applied to cope with the vague, uncertain and qualitative information. A novel integrated MCDM “fuzzy DEMATEL-AEW-FVIKOR” approach is developed to choose a best recycling partner for small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs). The combined weighting technique integrating subjective weight based on fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEDL) method with objective weight based on anti-entropy weighting (AEW) has been coupled with the fuzzy VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) operations to choose the best candidate. To investigate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, a case application has been conducted in a SME. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis of the method is also detected. The results argue that the best selected partner alternative keeps a high conformance with Shemshadi's and Chaghooshi's methods, and it demonstrates a strong robustness when v and φ parameters fluctuate. Besides, the proposed hybrid fuzzy DEMATEL-AEW-FVIKOR method shows its advantage in flexibility concerning the decision makers' preference. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy DEMATEL-AEW-FVIKOR; Hybrid MCDM approach; Recycling partner; Small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs); Sustainable supply chain practice (SSCP)","Decision making; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Fuzzy Decision making; Fuzzy dematel; Hybrid MCDM approach; Qualitative information; Small and medium enterprise; Social perspective; Sustainable management; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049316953

We find that rating similarity between friends is significantly higher after the formation of the friend relationship, indicating that with social-networking functions, online rating contributors are socially nudged when giving their ratings.

Although an attractive goal to most, executives face difficulties in implementing; sustainable manufacturing due to the necessity of balancing social, economic and environmental; outcomes associated with the implementation of different manufacturing alternatives and; processes. This is especially true in highly competitive consumer-oriented industries, such as the automotive industry. The literature review presented herein indicated that most of the available sustainability frameworks are qualitative in nature and limited to discussion of sustainable materials and processes, while tradeoffs between the environmental, social and economic domains of sustainability are rarely examined. To overcome such shortcomings, we develop a quantitative framework for sustainable manufacturing and illustrate its application for the automotive industry. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is utilized to combine the values of industry executives and decision makers with performance criteria of different car manufacturing materials (ferrous metals, aluminum, plastics, organic composites, and synthetic composites). Our results show how material alternatives in manufacturing can be quantitatively selected based on sustainability objectives. Additionally, we illustrate how sensitivity analyses are used to assess the robustness of the resulting alternative selection. Although this framework may be useful for decision makers in its current form, future applications might improve the model by choosing different or more specific alternatives, using objective performance scores supported by industry research, or by investigating a more diverse set of weight distributions representing dissimilar stakeholder values. © 2018","Automotive industry; Decision analysis; Manufacturing; MCDA; Sustainability","Automotive industry; Decision making; Decision theory; Manufacture; Plastics industry; Sensitivity analysis; Synthetic metals; Alternative selections; MCDA; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Performance criterion; Quantitative frameworks; Sustainability objectives; Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable materials; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046007644

The three dimensions of emotional solidarity were considered in the study: feeling welcomed, sympathetic understanding, and emotional closeness. Results indicate that visitors’ feeling welcomed and sympathetic understanding directly influence loyalty. In particular, the relationships involving visitors’ feeling welcomed by residents, emotional closeness with residents, and sympathetic understanding with residents and loyalty were all mediated by satisfaction. Additionally, gender was found to moderate the conditional indirect effects of emotional closeness and feeling welcomed on loyalty (via satisfaction). Such relationships were stronger among male visitors.

We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.","Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity","Aircraft manufacture; Consumer behavior; Purchasing; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Online product reviews; Product returns; Product reviews; Product uncertainties; Purchase decision; Regression discontinuity; Return probabilities; Theoretical modeling; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049954369

The methodology adopts a mixed methods approach combining a desk-based research with rich empirical data from interviews with senior management practitioners and academics in the fields of CE and RRL. From this research, it was found that embedding CE values within RRL necessitates the adoption of a multi-faceted approach.

This paper evaluates the effects of the water quality regulations on firms’ emissions of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and productivity in the 3Rs3Ls basins. We find that although the water quality regulations forced many small, heavily-polluting firms to shut down, they had no statistically significant effects on surviving firms’ productivity because they were ineffective in reducing their COD emissions. A policy that forces the surviving firms to reduce their emissions would reduce their output values and productivity, at least in the short run. However, the effect is likely to be small. Specifically, a 10% reduction in total COD emissions from the industrial sectors would require only a 0.1% reduction in output values under the current production technologies.

Yet, the key question “How do service market strategy change and the accompanying business model change interact, and how does their interplay affect value creation?” remains open. Relying on twelve case studies of firms that have shifted towards providing highly advanced services (e.g. outcome-based contracts), theoretical propositions concerning the interplay of market strategy and business model on value creation are derived. The firms studied report two interdependent changes: first, they evolve the market strategy from provision of pure products to provision of services and then outcomes, in order to achieve a better fit with customer needs and to grow their service businesses. Second, they rely increasingly on partners and suppliers to provide new activities that are outside their competence base. This 'open business model' allows them to grow their new service businesses effectively and efficiently. At the same time, however, the shift to a service market strategy requires enhanced accountability to customers and increases the threat of penalties in the case of failure, while reliance on partners and suppliers leads to loss of control over the activity system and increases the threat of failure due to third party dependency. Thus, this paper finds that the success of firms that shift to services and outcomes hinges on their ability to balance the trade-off between increased value (i.e. growth, efficiency and effectiveness) and increased uncertainty associated with service market strategy/open business model interplay. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Open business models; Outcome-based contracts; Service innovation; Service market strategy; Servitization","Software engineering; Business modeling; Business models; Financial performance; Manufacturing sector; Product portfolios; Service innovation; Service markets; Servitization; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045098947

Their wider adoption and diffusion is necessary to tackle pressing societal problems. How they are implemented and what determines their success (or lack thereof) in the market is not yet well understood, however, and deserves further exploration. To help fill the gap in knowledge, this study examines an emerging and innovative type of sustainable business model based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of underutilised assets facilitated by digital platforms. Its aim is to identify possible reasons for their commercial success or failure. In particular, the study investigates the values of users of a successful P2P goods-sharing platform and to what extent they differ from values of users of a comparable, yet unsuccessful, platform. Previous research on a UK-based online marketplace, Ecomodo, measured people's motivations for joining and the value priorities of users using Schwartz's Portrait Value Questionnaire. Results were compared with data from a representative sample of the UK population and used to explain the platform's low market uptake. The same study is here replicated with members of Peerby, an online marketplace where people rent, lend and borrow their possessions with each other. The analysis shows similar value priorities and orientation in Ecomodo and Peerby respondents, which suggests that the failure of the former platform and the success of the latter may be more directly attributed to differences in their business model design and execution than the types of user. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Market acceptance; P2P sharing platforms; Sharing economy; Sustainable business models; Values","Commerce; Managers; Marketing; Purchasing; Sales; Behavior; Consumer theory; Environment; Green marketing; Literature reviews; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038871551

(d) Acknowledgment that the root cause of cost overrun is behavioral bias; in contrast to explanations in terms of scope changes, complexity, etc. (e) De-biasing cost estimates with reference class forecasting or similar methods based in behavioral science; as opposed to conventional methods of estimation, with their century-long track record of inaccuracy and systemic bias. Bad practice is characterized by violating at least one of these five points. Love and Ahiaga-Dagbui violate all five.

The majority of traditional approaches for environmental efficiency measures take pollutant emissions as either undesirable outputs or environmentally determined inputs which suffer a limitation of not satisfying the physical laws that regulate the operation of economic and environmental process. In this study, we propose a DEA based approach which is combined with the materials balance principle (MBP) that accounts for laws of thermodynamics to jointly evaluate environmental and abatement efficiency. This approach is along the line of weak G-disposability based modelling but is an extension to existing models that in our approach the identification of possible adjustments on polluting mass bound in inputs and outputs, and potential adjustments on abatement of pollutants are all included. The overall environmental efficiency measured by this approach is decomposed into the measures of technical efficiency, polluting inputs allocative efficiency, and polluting and non-polluting inputs allocative efficiency with the emphasizing of incorporating pollutant abatement activities. Accordingly, new measures of abatement efficiency are proposed which help to identify the pollutant abatement potential that can be achieved from end-of-pipe abatement technology promotion associated with polluting input quality promotion and input resources reallocation. Furthermore, several global Malmquist productivity indices for identifying the changes on environmental and abatement efficiency are proposed. This approach is applied to China's thermal power industry and some empirical results verifying the necessity of introducing the MBP are obtained. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electricity generation; Emission reduction; Materials balance principle; OR in environment and climate change; Pollutant abatement","Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Disposability; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Pollution; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics; Abatement technologies; Balance principle; Electricity generation; Emission reduction; Environmental efficiency; Malmquist productivity index; Pollutant abatement; Traditional approaches; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019051617

To achieve this, we first conducted case studies, including semi-structured interviews with store managers. This exploratory research involved 28 cases across dominant retail store formats (i.e., super- and hypermarkets and discount and convenience stores). The results along with secondary data research underlie a process simulation modeling approach that quantifies the impact of selected root causes of food waste by considering the dependencies between them. Finally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 food waste experts to confirm findings of the case studies and simulations and to delineate the practical implications of our research and the related solutions. Our findings show that the root causes of food waste are related to undesirable customer behavior and erratic demand, inefficient store operations and replenishment policies, and elevated product (quality) requirements of both retail organizations and customers. Root causes and their impacts differ across store formats and product categories. Furthermore, the interdependencies between the root causes in the different spheres of responsibility and influence (i.e., customers, the store, and the parent organization) are evident.

This triggered our study to examine patients' desire to seek health information largely driven by increased access via the Internet and the cumulative impacts on value co-creation. We employed a sequential exploratory design involving a phenomenological approach in the qualitative phase, followed by a quantitative survey design to further our understanding of the influence of technology in co-creating value in healthcare at the micro level. Advances in technology have empowered patients to be informed, which enabled them to play an active role in clinical encounters with the doctor. The findings suggest pre-encounter information search impacts positively on improved service engagement and commitment to compliance with medical instructions. It does this by shaping the nature of interactions; enhancing provider-patient orientation; and increasing their involvement in a shared decision-making process. From a theoretical perspective, our study integrates multiple research perspectives (e.g., access to information, online information seeking and knowledge creation, healthcare consultation models, etc.) and extends research on patient integration, participation, and co-creation of value.

We classify all location-related factors into three categories: accessibility to points of interest, transport convenience, and surrounding environment. Our results suggest that a property’s accessibility to attractions, airports, universities and public transportation, as well as green spaces, bodies of water, and local businesses are significant determinants. Free parking and airport shuttle bus service could mitigate disadvantages related to inferior airport accessibility. Moreover, we underscore different hotel location satisfaction effects across travelers’ experiences and types of travel described in the online reviews.

Within cities, the mobility sector promises the highest potential of carbon emission reduction. The disruptive business innovation brought about by the advent of app-based smart-sharing systems is emancipating collaborative consumption of mobility at larger and deeper scales, ranging from car-pooling, expanded electric vehicle (EV) use to bike-sharing. Synchronizing the existing yet under-realized low-carbon transport modes in cities, such as public transport, with emerging and diversifying app-based sharing mobility business models, offers huge potential to transform urban mobility toward sustainability. Yet, the rapid business expansion and innovation of the sharing mobility companies have profoundly challenged existing socio-economic relationships, knowledge systems and physical infrastructures in cities. This study explores the synergy between the social-ecological innovation in the sharing economy and the sustainable development of urban systems, using empirical data from three business cases in the emerging sharing mobility sector – in modes of ride-sharing, EV-sharing and bike-sharing - of Shanghai, China. It indicates that there is a strong co-evolution mechanism between the transformation towards more sustainable city at the macro-level and the business ecosystem innovation towards greener and smarter transport at the meso-level. We argue that the two level transformations, triggered by the disruptive innovation of the sharing economy and led by urban transformation towards sustainability, mutually influence each other and re-enforce sustainable values and practices in the fast changing urban context and business innovations in Shanghai. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Business ecosystem; Innovation; Shanghai; Sharing economy; Sustainability; urban mobility","Carbon; Economics; Ecosystems; Emission control; Mass transportation; Planning; Sustainable development; Business ecosystem; Carbon emission reductions; Disruptive innovations; Ecological innovations; Shanghai; Sharing economy; Urban mobility; Urban sustainability; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047481248

We first consider the difference of marginal abatement costs among cities, and construct the non-radial directional distance function with multiple abatement factors. The total-factor CO2 emission performance index and its dynamic change index are then proposed to measure CO2 emission performance. Considering equity and efficiency, we develop a composite index by the hybrid method to allocate emissions quota, which considers CO2 emissions as well as CO2 emission performance. Then we conduct an empirical study using inputs and outputs dataset of 71 Chinese cities in 2005–2012. Chinese cities have poor energy efficiency and still have high CO2 emissions. The eastern region outperforms the central region and the western region performs worst, whereas the dynamic CO2 emission performance of the central region has the largest increase. The change of CO2 emission performance is driven mainly by technological advances. As for the CO2 emission allocation, the composite index method encourages cities to reduce emissions and enhance emission performance through carbon trading market. It also motivates cities with high historical emissions to reduce their emissions by improving technology when they have poor CO2 emission performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission allocation; Data envelopment analysis; Multiple abatement factors; Total-factor CO2 emission performance; Urban environment","Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Energy efficiency; CO2 emissions; Directional distance function; Equity and efficiencies; Historical emissions; Marginal abatement costs; Multiple abatement factors; Technological advances; Urban environments; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038808657

We find that suppliers with smaller market share are associated with more trade credit, confirming that suppliers with weak market power use trade credit as a competitive tool. Next, we find that buyers with larger market share are associated with more trade credit, whereas suppliers selling to a concentrated buyer base are associated with less trade credit; by di erentiating competition in buyers’ markets from competition between supply chain partners, we show that the two types of competition have di erent impacts on trade credit. In studying the impact of trade credit on firm performance, we make the distinction between an industry-average trade credit and an individual supply chain’s deviation from such an industry average. When suppliers o er trade credit at their industry-average level, this action facilitates trade and, thus, is positively associated with both parties’ performance; conversely, when suppliers are more aggressive in their trade credit strategy than the industry average, then the excess trade credit is negatively associated with buyer performance.

Then, we analyze the game dominated by the manufacturer with and without considering pricing policies. We prove that consumer low-carbon awareness improvement incentives channel members to invest in emission reduction and promotion and that this investment is beneficial to member profits and utilities. The channel members’ utilities increase with their social preference value. However, their profits, emission-reduction level and promotion level might not necessarily do so. In the manufacturer-led supply chain, wholesale price increases with the retailer's social preference value and decreases with that of the manufacturer. The retail price decreases with the manufacturer's social preference value and increases with that of the retailer. The manners that the leader's decision affects the follower's decision-making and the channel members’ social preferences affect their decision-making depend on who the dominator is in the supply chain.

Potential consumers of remanufactured automobile parts in China were surveyed and the data were analyzed via structural equation modeling. The results suggest that energy saving, material saving and emission-reduction information regarding remanufactured products positively affect consumers’ perceived value and trust of remanufactured products. Green certification moderates the relationships between both the energy saving and material saving information and trust. This research improves understanding of how firms can influence consumer perception of remanufactured products, thus contributing to the discourse in the literature on remarketing of remanufactured products.

Although extant literature offers important insights into platform management from a platformowner perspective, we know little about how organizations manage industry platforms provided by external parties to generate opportunities and overcome challenges in relation to their infrastructure and work processes. As part of larger ecosystems, these digital platforms offer organizations bundles of digital options that they can selectively invest in over time. At the same time, organizations' previous investments in digital infrastructure and work processes produce a legacy of digital debt that conditions how they manage their digital platforms over time. Against this backdrop, we investigate how digital options and digital debt were implicated in a large Scandinavian media organization's management of a news production platform over nearly 17 years. Drawing on extant literature and the findings from this case, we theorize the progression of and interactions between digital options and digital debt during an organization's digital platform management in relation to its infrastructure and work processes. The theory reveals the complex choices that organizations face in such efforts: While they may have to resolve digital debt to make a platform's digital options actionable, hesitancy to plant digital debt may equally well prevent them from realizing otherwise attractive digital options. Similarly, while identified digital options may offer organizations new opportunities to resolve digital debt, eagerness to realize digital options may just as easily lead to unwise planting of digital debt. © 2018 INFORMS.","Digital debt; Digital infrastructure; Digital options; Digital platforms; Organizational management of industry platforms","Production platforms; Digital debt; Digital infrastructures; Digital options; Digital platforms; Organizational management; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048681043

It is increasingly acknowledged that the efficiency of water resource system is influenced by not only the Water Use (WU) process, but also the process of Wastewater Treatment (WT). This paper considers both WU and WT as an integrated two-stage WUWT system to provide more comprehensive efficiency evaluation. In the first stage (WU subsystem), there are two parallel units, economic and social WU sub-minors, which consume water and capital to produce economic and social benefits. Meanwhile, the undesirable wastewater inevitably arises, which is treated in the second stage (WT subsystem). In order to assess the performance of the integrated WUWT system, an extended mixed network structure two-stage Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model is developed to measure the detailed efficiencies and spot the weak link of the system. For case study, the provincial panel data during 2006–2015 of China are selected to verify the applicability of the proposed approach. Discussion is made from both time- and region-perspectives: over the ten years, the WU efficiencies are often higher than the WT efficiencies, so more actions should be carried out to improve the process of WT; from 2006 to 2011, social WU efficiencies are often lower than economic WU efficiencies, but the social WU efficiency has been improved after 2012; in terms of the overall efficiencies, the economically and socially developed provinces also have the higher efficiencies. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the integrated WUWT system is efficient if and only if both WU and WT subsystem are both efficient, and the WU subsystem is efficient if and only if both economic and social WU sub-minors are efficient. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Mixed network structure; Overall efficiency; Two-stage SBM DEA; Undesirable output; Water resource","Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Efficiency; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water resources; Water treatment; Comprehensive efficiencies; Economic and social benefits; Mixed network; Overall efficiency; Two-stage; Undesirable output; Wastewater treatment system; Water resource systems; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045753124

We also find that the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) adversely affects the production of cleaner energy. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of financial market development, cleaner energy, and controlling for the effect of government subsidy on cleaner energy. By supporting the demand-induced supply of cleaner energy, we demonstrate that the positive and significant effect of financial market development (FMD) on cleaner energy is stronger in countries with higher growth in carbon intensity and a lower availability of fossil fuels than otherwise. Our results also support the argument that financing uncertain projects such as those that produce cleaner energy should be greater in countries with a higher innovation culture than those where financial markets are already accustomed to undertaking risky investments.

Qualitative data were collected with an organisational perspective from commercial food consumers along with large-scale food importers, distributors, and retailers. Cause-effect models are built and “what-if” simulations are conducted through the development and application of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approaches to elucidate dynamic interrelationships. The simulation models developed provide a practical insight into existing and emergent food losses scenarios, suggesting the need for big data sets to allow for generalizable findings to be extrapolated from a more detailed quantitative exercise. This research offers itself as evidence to support policy makers in the development of policies that facilitate interventions to reduce food losses. It also contributes to the literature through sustaining, impacting and potentially improving levels of food security, underpinned by empirically constructed policy models that identify potential behavioural changes.

In order to achieve a desirable balance among the economic growth, environmental friendliness, and social equity, it is essential to scientifically manage and monitor the corporate sustainability. This paper proposes a three-dimensional (economic, environmental, and social) sustainability assessment model to analyze the corporate sustainable performance based on principal component analysis. An effective evaluation indicator system for cooperate sustainability assessment is provided after conducting reliability and validity analysis. Considering the coordination degree of sustainable development among the three dimensions, the corporate sustainability index is used to express the overall sustainability performance of a company. A case study on the internal combustion engine manufacturing industry in China has been conducted to verify the validity and practicability of the proposed method. A questionnaire survey was conducted at 52 companies to collect the economic, environmental, and social indicators data during 2010–2012. A total of 49 companies responded, yielding a total of 103 economic samples, 102 social samples, and 79 environmental samples. The results of this investigation show that a large gap exist in the reported enterprises in their sustainability, and most of them are recommended to take measures to improve the sustainability performance. At the end, a specific company is selected to illustrate how to identify the strengths and weaknesses of its sustainability performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese Internal Combustion Engine manufacturing Industry; Corporate sustainability assessment; Multivariate statistics; Principal component analysis","Combustion; Economics; Internal combustion engines; Manufacture; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Corporate sustainability indices; Corporate-sustainability; Environmental friendliness; Evaluation indicator system; Multivariate statistics; Reliability and validity; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047469479

Employing a quantitative survey design, 738 consumers with prior experience in following or engaging with brands on social media were randomly interviewed using an online questionnaire. While social presence positively influence social brand engagement, this relationship is significantly moderated by firm-generated content and the consumers’ level of commitment in engaging with the brand. The findings also indicate that SBE encourages consumers to increase their intention to use the brand as well as engage in electronic word of mouth. Further, this study provides insights into the potential role of SBE and social presence in advancing the broader understanding of brand relationship management, brand engagement and social media research.

This paper offers a solution to this problem in multi-period regional R&D efficiency measurement with a novel application to China's regional R&D systems. This solution can present a systemic measurement for the overall efficiency score of multi-period regional R&D investment activities, and deduce a weighted decomposition of the overall efficiency score into period efficiency scores. This paper develops a dynamic analytical framework with a new estimation technique from a long-term and systemic perspective associated with data envelopment analysis technique. Our efficiency model with endogenous weights on period efficiencies effectively accounts for the linking function and double role of R&D capital stock in the operation of connected regional R&D systems and the intertemporal dependence of R&D investment on R&D outputs. The R&D capital stock as the carry-over estimated using the perpetual inventory method helps this efficiency model to account for the time lag and multi-period influence of R&D inputs on R&D outputs. This approach is applied to a new database of R&D input-output systems in China's provinces during the first five-year period (2006–2010) after China's National Plan for Medium- and Long-term Scientific and Technological Development (NPMLSTD). © 2017","China's provincial regions; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency measurement and decomposition; Multi-period regional R&D systems; Perpetual inventory method; R&D capital stock","China; data base; decomposition; investment; model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015305361

Integrating the emerging literature on social media and crowdfunding with the literature on social networks and public goods, we theorize that prosocially, public-oriented crowdfunding campaigns will benefit disproportionately from social media activity when advocates' social media networks exhibit greater levels of embeddedness. Drawing on a panel dataset that combines campaign fundraising activity associated with more than 1,000 campaigns on Kickstarter with campaign-related social media activity on Twitter, we construct network-level measures of embeddedness between and amongst individuals initiating the latter, in terms of transitivity and topological overlap. We demonstrate that Twitter activity drives a disproportionate increase in fundraising for prosocially oriented crowdfunding campaigns when posting users' networks exhibit greater embeddedness. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, highlighting how our work extends prior research on the role of embeddedness in peer influence by demonstrating the joint roles of message features and network structure in the peer influence process. Our work suggests that when a transmitter's message is prosocial or cause-oriented, embeddedness will play a stronger role in determining influence. We also discuss the broader theoretical implications for the literatures on social media, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and private contributions to public goods. Finally, we highlight the practical implications for marketers, campaign organizers, and crowdfunding platform operators.

However, when calculating the cross-period DDFs, the M-L index has the same infeasibility problem as the Malmquist index does. To address this infeasibility problem, this paper discusses when infeasibility may happen and develops a modified M-L index that is based on a new DDF. We propose that the modified M-L index can be applied to assessing environmental performance at both macro- and micro-levels. At a macro-level, we evaluate China's growth in total factor productivity (TFP) from 1999 to 2012, accounting for undesirable impacts. The results show that technical change is the main driver of most TFP growth. The TFP changes support the status quo of a distinct gap in economic development among different regions. At a micro-level, we assess Chinese auto manufacturers’ environmental performance from 2005 to 2012. The results suggest that Chinese automakers have enjoyed a noticeable TFP improvement, and that technical change is the major contributor as well. Taking together, reducing air emissions and other pollutants is an effective way of improving environmental productivity. As demonstrated, the proposed modified M-L index has proved to be consistently feasible and guarantees non-negative reference targets for all metrics. As a result, we recommend the modified M-L index as a robust tool for solving the infeasibility problem that is typical in conventional index and for assessing productivity under environmental impacts. © 2017","Automobile manufacturer; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Environmental productivity; Malmquist-Luenberger (M-L) productivity index; Total factor productivity (TFP)","Automobile manufacture; Data envelopment analysis; Environmental management; Manufacture; Problem solving; Productivity; Automobile manufacturers; Directional distance function; Environmental performance; Malmquist-luenberger productivity indices; Productivity index; Productivity measurements; Productivity performance; Total factor productivity; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009759114

We hypothesize that with increasing country familiarity, (a) manager investment of cognitive effort (process) first increases and then decreases, and (b) the likelihood of a country being included for further consideration (outcome) also increases and then decreases. We further hypothesize that the effects of country familiarity are contingent on the managers' international experience. Empirical evidence from verbal protocol analyses of managers provides strong support to our arguments. These findings contribute to the emergent literature on the critical role of cognition in decision making about foreign markets. Manager cognition potentially influences sequential/non-sequential entry decision making, possibly explaining some previously observed exceptions to internationalization process theory. The contingent role of international experience further stresses that the influence of cognition in internationalization decision making is both important and complex, involving, at least, innate cognitive processes, idiosyncratic knowledge, and international experience.

Under the carbon emission tax policy, manufacturers face a choice of whether to reduce their carbon emission through remanufacturing or low-carbon technologies. In this paper, we characterize the optimal carbon emission tax policy through a two-period production decision model, in which new products and remanufactured products are clearly distinguishable. The effects of a carbon emission tax on the optimal production decision of manufacturing and remanufacturing is investigated. It is found that there are rational remanufacturing production strategies for different products based on different remanufacturing cost savings and carbon emission savings per remanufactured product under a carbon emission tax policy.

It is, therefore, imperative that we include sustainability in measuring the supply chain performance of a firm. However, very few studies have investigated the impact of sustainability on supply chain performance. This paper presents a unique approach for calculating a supply chain performance index, which could be used by automobile firms. Based on literature review and expert opinion, we first identified the supply chain functions that influence sustainability and supply chain performance. Subsequently, a questionnaire was designed, and a survey of Indian automobile firms was conducted. The partial least squares technique was used to explore the relationship between the identified factors and supply chain performance. Moreover, an integrated model combining the partial least squares and analytic hierarchy process was developed to compute the supply chain performance index. We further found that sustainability performance mediates the relationships of supply chain functions to supply chain performance. Finally, implications to theory and practice are discussed, especially for emerging economies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic hierarchy process; Partial least squares; Supply chain; Supply chain performance index; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Competition; Least squares approximations; Surveys; Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Integrated modeling; Manufacturing practices; Partial least square (PLS); Supply chain functions; Supply chain performance; Sustainability performance; Sustainable practices; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042921003

Detection of such frauds is a time-consuming and challenging task. Traditionally, researchers have been relying on financial data and/or textual content from financial statements to detect corporate fraud. Guided by systemic functional linguistics (SFL) theory, we propose an analytic framework that taps into unstructured data from financial social media platforms to assess the risk of corporate fraud. We assemble a unique data set including 64 fraudulent firms and a matched sample of 64 nonfraudulent firms, as well as the social media data prior to the firm’s alleged fraud violation in Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs). Our framework automatically extracts signals such as sentiment features, emotion features, topic features, lexical features, and social network features, which are then fed into machine learning classifiers for fraud detection. We evaluate and compare the performance of our algorithm against baseline approaches using only financial ratios and language-based features respectively. We further validate the robustness of our algorithm by detecting leaked information and rumors, testing the algorithm on a new data set, and conducting an applicability check. Our results demonstrate the value of financial social media data and serve as a proof of concept of using such data to complement traditional fraud detection methods.

The integration of value creation and recovery activities into retail customer value propositions is, however, under researched and raises many challenges, especially in Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retail where few real-world examples have been published. The recent emergence of the term ‘circular economy’ has initiated further debate about closed loop value propositions and closed loop supply chain implications. This paper selects four circular economy-led closed loop product case examples from a major European FMCG company, and assesses, at a high level, how these cases created value, for whom value was created, and key challenges in their implementation. The findings highlight that each case is different. Closing loops and creating successful value propositions is complex and requires simultaneous reconfiguration of key building blocks to ensure customer acceptance and business viability. The paper proposes the term ‘circular supply chain’ for cases where circular economy principles are explicitly incorporated in CLSC for value creation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; circular economy; circular supply chain; Closed loop supply chain; supply chain management; value creation","Linear matrix inequalities; Sales; Business to business; Business viability; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Customer acceptance; Fast moving consumer goods; Value creation; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047382326

First introduced by Cohen and Levinthal (1989), it is typically defined as a set of organizational routines and processes that allow firms to assimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge. An aspect that has been ignored by the literature on absorptive capacity is the nature of the knowledge being absorbed. This paper suggests that the learning strategies underpinning absorptive capacity adapt to the type of external knowledge they are more likely to get exposure to and as a result, not all the firms appear to benefit from the same type of external knowledge for the same level of absorptive capacity. To this purpose, we explore how firm-level absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between rent and pure R&D spillovers on the one hand and firm-level turnover on the other in three economic areas (Europe, Japan and US). The empirical analysis uses a dataset (sourced from the EU R&D investment scoreboards) made of 879 worldwide R&D-intensive manufacturing firms. Given the panel data structure of the sample, econometric techniques that deal with unobserved heterogeneity as well as weak exogeneity are employed. The empirical results suggest for the same level of absorptive capacity, firms in economic areas that are closer to the world technology frontier tend to benefit more from pure (knowledge) spillovers than from rent spillovers. Vice versa, firms located in areas that are not on the technology frontier appear to benefit mostly from rent spillovers that travel along the supply chain. These results suggest that absorptive capacity changes with the type of knowledge they may get exposed to. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Panel data models; R&D spillovers; Total factor productivity growth","Productivity; Supply chains; Absorptive capacity; Empirical analysis; External knowledge; Learning strategy; Manufacturing firms; Panel data models; Total factor productivity; Unobserved heterogeneity; Telecommunication industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041479143

However, building information modeling (BIM) has overcome this diffusion challenge and has revolutionized such common practices as shifting the design process from two-dimensional (2D) drafting toward three-dimensional (3D) design, automated quantity takeoffs, and clash detection; such success marks the relevance of this technology for studying how technological innovations spread throughout the construction industry. Although some studies have explored BIM adoption, investigations using diffusion models to study the diffusion patterns of different BIM functions (e.g., 3D visualization, clash detection, energy modeling) are missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this study uses reliable innovation diffusion models to describe the diffusion patterns of various BIM functions in the U.S. construction industry. Specifically, this study developed and sent a comprehensive questionnaire to 3,017 owner representatives, architects, and project managers; 118 individuals responded to the survey, of whom 81 are BIM users. The three most widely adopted BIM functions were 3D visualization, clash detection, and constructability analysis; the least frequently implemented functions were code validation; material tracking, delivery, and management; facility management; and energy analysis. Using these responses, this study analyzed the diffusion patterns of the BIM functions using four innovation diffusion models: internal (logistic), external, Bass, and Gompertz. Using such measures as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and variants of it, this study identified the Bass model as having the highest explanatory power for diffusion and determined that internal factors (e.g., imitation and bandwagon pressure) have the most influence on adoption rates of BIM functions. Furthermore, the diffusion models showed that the shop-drawing process and facility management functions had the lowest saturation rate in 2014 (below 50%) but have a greater potential for being adopted in coming years. The findings of this study advance knowledge for both researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption process of different BIM functions and provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diffusion patterns of ICT innovations in the construction industry. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Construction; Construction industry; Diffusion; Information theory; Office buildings; Structural design; Surveys; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Akaike's information criterions; Building Information Model - BIM; Constructability analysis; Information and Communication Technologies; Innovation diffusion models; Technological innovation; Three dimensional (3D) design; Two Dimensional (2 D); Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038435344

From a survey conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, we found that perceived review quality positively impacts informational influence, while perceived review quality, consistency, and social presence jointly impact value-expressive influence.

However, new customers cannot readily discern the quality of unfamiliar sellers. Sellers often try to reduce the information asymmetry and signal their quality by ensuring good website interface usability, considering that the website is the main point of contact with online shoppers. Most research on signaling has focused on its pre-purchase effects. Although researchers have argued that signaling could affect future purchase decisions, how signaling influences repurchase intention has not been detailed. This study proposes a model of the influence based on the signaling theory and expectation-confirmation model. The model posits that a signal influences an online shopper's expectation and the expectation-confirmation subsequently determines repurchase intention. The model was tested with pre-purchase and post-purchase data collected in a two-stage survey and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings indicate that signaling goes beyond the pre-purchase stage of initial purchase to influence repurchase intention. This indicates that signaling has longer-term effect than that typically examined in signaling research and further research on the effect is needed. For practice, the findings indicate that online sellers need to send realistic signals to attract returning customers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Information need; Online shopping; Repurchase intention; Signaling; Website usability","Electronic commerce; Sales; Web Design; Websites; Expectation-confirmation models; Information asymmetry; Information need; Online shopping; Repurchase intention; Structural equation modeling; Website interfaces; Website usability; Signaling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044350414

This is an important question because user contributions are important drivers of technological progress and business value. We examine the effect of platform sponsors’ investments in online communities on user knowledge contributions, using fine-grained longitudinal data from a leading enterprise software vendor’s community network. We focus on the sponsor practice of knowledge seeding, in which its employees provide free technical support by answering questions posted in discussion forums. We define user knowledge contribution as peer-evaluated, quality-weighted solutions that community members provide to help resolve the questions their peers raise. We show that the platform sponsor’s investments in knowledge seeding have a positive, significant association with user knowledge contribution. We also find temporal and geographical variations in returns on the sponsor’s knowledge investments. Specifically, returns (i.e., amount of user contribution that is stimulated) decrease with the age of the community, consistent with the observation that the most active contributors are lead users who tend to join the community early.

In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes. The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot-level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs. © 2017 The Author(s)","contract farming; market failures; poverty reduction; productivity; profitability; value chain","contract farming; maize; market development; poverty alleviation; productivity; profitability; welfare economics; Ghana; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042165849

I begin by exploring the literature on CSR and development in the mining industry, motives for CSR engagement in the industry, and risk and risk management. I then draw on my research data to map how CSR programmes are seen as an important method of managing strategic challenges to firms — categorised here as reputational, operational or regulatory ‘risks’—and note how competition for capital and recent changes in the legal environment have furthered this process. A focus on CSR as risk management can illuminate the poor development outcomes of community CSR projects, despite recent rises in spending. ‘CSR as risk management’ introduces immanent limitations including treating CSR as PR, targeting those that pose the greatest threat rather than those with the greatest need, excessively simplifying complex processes and focussing on maintaining the status quo. In risk management thinking, CSR activities may be a high organisational priority, integrated into central decision-making processes and subject to a great deal of investment, but still see little progress towards inclusive development for those living closest to mining operations. I conclude by reflecting on what this means for future action and research. © 2018 The Author","Accountability; Corporate social responsibility; Development; Mining; Risk","Competition; Decision making; Mining; Risks; Accountability; Complex Processes; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Decision making process; Development; Mining companies; Mining operations; Strategic challenges; Risk management; accountability; corporate social responsibility; decision making; local participation; metals industry; mining industry; participatory approach; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054707960

However, measuring the environmental performance of supply chains is a challenging task, due to several factors, such as the lack of standardised methodologies and the inherent multi-criteria nature of the problem. By leveraging the capability of a Multi-Regional Input–Output framework to handle the complex and global nature of supply chains, the current work presents a robust environmental sustainable performance measurement model underpinned by industrial lifecycle thinking. As a result, some theoretical insights are provided and an empirical application of the model to the Metal Products industry of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) nations undertaken in an attempt to address some of the methodological and applied measurement challenges. In particular, this allowed the modelling of carbon emissions trends within, and between the BRICS nations and with the Rest-of-the-World over a 20-year period (1992–2011) as well as providing an opportunity to hypothesis on their future carbon emissions performances. Specific analyses of the Metal Product industry showed that demand represents the main driver for the increasing carbon footprint. However, the overall decline in reported carbon footprint was due to improvements in emissions intensity and efficiency gains induced by technology. The study further assesses the effects of imports and economic growth on carbon footprint and discusses the implications of the study to sustainability transition processes in the BRICS nations. © 2017 The Authors","BRICS; Industry lifecycle thinking; Operational research in environment and climate change; Supply chain; Sustainable performance measurement","Chains; Climate change; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Life cycle; Supply chains; Sustainable development; BRICS; Environmental performance; Industry lifecycle; Operational research; Supply chain performance measurements; Sustainability transition; Sustainable performance; Sustainable supply chains; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034017956

While prior research has found herding among investors at the listing level, such social behavior has been underexplored at a macro, platform level. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap by examining whether subsequent investors follow their predecessors’ actions when choosing which platform to invest, and if so, how various platform attributes and regulations moderate herding behavior. We collected a novel data set from leading platforms in a large P2P lending market. Our baseline analysis reveals that herding exists at the platform level. Using a multilevel model, we further identify several interesting moderators: the investor’s herding behavior is accentuated by platforms’ market share and the cumulative amount funded, but attenuated by their time in operation. Finally, we find that government regulatory events dampen the magnitude of the herding effect, suggesting that more information disclosure and stricter operation standards reduce the value of observational learning. The results from our analysis provide implications for P2P lending investors, platform designers, and policymakers.

Reducing overall emissions while keeping a high pace of economic development is at the heart of the sustainable development concept. When emissions grow less rapidly than GDP environmental economists speak of relative decoupling; if emissions even decrease relative to the pace of economic growth, then decoupling is absolute. Assessing these options requires an empirical analysis of the emissions-GDP relationship. The study of this nexus has special importance for developed countries, given their historical responsibility towards global warming. At the same time, in the last decades, the same countries have been at the forefront of the fight against climate change in terms of emissions-reduction efforts. By applying cutting-edge econometric techniques, this paper aims to investigate the decoupling options, if any, for a group of European economies which can be considered as pioneers in pursuing the sustainable development goals. This question gains further importance considering that some recent studies have found positive GDP elasticities of emissions for certain developed countries, which may be seen as a cause of concern for the sustainable development path of such countries. Unlike the bulk of the literature, in this paper, we allow the income elasticity of emissions – a critical indicator for the study of decoupling – to vary over time. The reason is that the elasticity might change through the time due to the factors affecting the main drivers of the CO2 emissions. We use a time-varying coefficients cointegration approach to investigate the CO2 emissions-GDP relationship for 12 Western European countries over a long time period ranging from 1861 to 2015. Our main finding is that the income elasticity of CO2 emissions is positive in all investigated countries. In addition, we find evidence in favor of relative decoupling in 8 out of the 12 European countries. This is in line with the fact that the selected European countries have shown more determination in adopting carbon reduction policies before and after the Kyoto protocol period and toward the Paris agreement compared to other leading economies such as China, United States, and Russia. For the remaining 4 cases, the income elasticity of CO2 emissions is in excess of unity. This can be considered as a call for policymakers to take quick and relevant measures to mitigate emissions level without harming the economic development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Decoupling; Economic growth; EKC hypothesis; Time-varying coefficient cointegration","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Elasticity; Emission control; Global warming; Planning; Sustainable development; CO2 emissions; Cointegration; Decoupling; Economic growths; EKC hypothesis; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental economics; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; integrated approach; international agreement; sustainable development; temporal variation; China; Russian Federation; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051249531

For a retailer, introducing omnichannel capabilities requires major investments to integrate physical stores and online marketplaces, yet holds a promise of potentially enhancing revenue streams from both brick-and-mortar (BM) stores and online store channels. We assess the promise of ship-to-store capabilities by analyzing transactional data from a national jewelry retailer to study impacts of introducing ship-to-store on a retailer's operating performance, in terms of sales and customer returns. Contrary to expectations, the findings show that online sales decreased after ship-to-store was introduced, although BM store sales increased. Detailed analysis of the transactional data suggests that, after STS implementation, some customers switched from the online channel to the brick-and-mortar channel. This switch occurred mainly for high-value purchases. The customers who actually remained with and fully completed a sale using the ship-to-store service typically were those that bought low-value items. Our findings also suggest that introducing ship-to-store increased cross-channel customer returns of online purchases to physical stores. Concurrently, these new ship-to-store returns generated additional BM store sales.

We aim to analyze whether these policies can improve the operation efficiency of current carbon market. By the Mean Reversion Test, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model, and Event Study Method, we first analyze the potential price discovery function of SHEA products, thereby describing the transmission channel of current policy to SHEA price. Then we examine the effect of carbon policies published in different periods on their corresponding SHEA price. By the Auto-correlation Test and CIR simulation, we find that 3/4 of all auto-correlation values are less than 0 after Apr. 2017, and the minimum cumulative error is 31.3792 under the supply and demand channel. These findings imply that SHEA price has the discovery function at the middle and end of trading period, and the current policy affects SHEA price through its effect on the fundamentals of supply and demand. Further, more than 60% of all r-values (r-value that reflects the response of price to policy) are less than 1, which implies that the published policy will improves future SHEA price. Accordingly, we argue that SEEE belongs to a policy-oriented market, and the change of carbon price is closely related to emission allocation policies. In this case, China's government should further push forward the smooth operation of current carbon market by the aid of incentive policy in the coming period. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon market; Policy regulation; Shanghai emission allowance price; Shanghai environment and energy exchange; Transmission channel","Economics; Emission control; Carbon markets; Emission allowances; Environment and energies; Policy regulations; Transmission channels; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042373833

Many researchers believe that the public mood or sentiment expressed in social media is related to financial markets. We propose to use trust among users as a filtering and amplifying mechanism for the social media to increase its correlation with financial data in the stock market. Therefore, we used the real stock market data as ground truth for our trust management system. We collected stock-related data (tweets) from Twitter, which is a very popular Micro-blogging forum, to see the correlation between the Twitter sentiment valence and abnormal stock returns for eight firms in the S&P 500. We developed a trust management framework to build a user-to-user trust network for Twitter users. Compared with existing works, in addition to analyzing and accumulating tweets’ sentiment, we take into account the source of tweets – their authors. Authors are differentiated by their power or reputation in the whole community, where power is determined by the user-to-user trust network. To validate our trust management system, we did the Pearson correlation test for an eight months period (the trading days from 01/01/2015 through 08/31/2015). Compared with treating all the authors equally important, or weighting them by their number of followers, our trust network based reputation mechanism can amplify the correlation between a specific firm's Twitter sentiment valence and the firm's stock abnormal returns. To further consider the possible auto-correlation property of abnormal stock returns, we constructed a linear regression model, which includes historical stock abnormal returns, to test the relation between the Twitter sentiment valence and abnormal stock returns. Again, our results showed that by using our trust network power based method to weight tweets, Twitter sentiment valence reflect abnormal stock returns better than treating all the authors equally important or weighting them by their number of followers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Linear regression; Sentiment analysis; Stock abnormal return; Trust management; Twitter trust network","Commerce; Correlation methods; Financial markets; Investments; Linear regression; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Abnormal returns; Linear regression models; On-line social networks; Stock market analysis; Trust management; Trust management frameworks; Trust management systems; Trust networks; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041101786

Using a panel data set from a large healthcare system in the United States, we find that e-visits trigger about 6% more office visits, with mixed results on phone visits and patient health. These additional visits come at the sacrifice of new patients: physicians accept 15% fewer new patients each month following e-visit adoption. Our data set on nearly 100,000 patients spans from 2008 to 2013, which includes the rollout and diffusion of e-visits in the health system we study. Identification comes from difference-in-differences estimates leveraging variation in the timing of e-visit adoption by both patients and providers.

Furthermore, we investigated the impact of simultaneously operating dual BM designs (i.e. novelty and efficiency) on firm performance and contingent effect of firm age on this relationship. Based on data from 241 Indian SMEs, our findings highlighted that BM novelty was of greater benefit to younger SMEs compared to mature SMEs, while BM efficiency was of greater benefit to more mature SMEs. The environmental dynamism positively moderated the relationship between BM novelty and performance but it negatively moderated the relationship between BM efficiency and performance. We also found that BM efficiency is more beneficial in a low, rather than a high, munificent environment but we found environmental munificence did not moderate the BM novelty and SME performance relationship. Finally, we found simultaneous deployment of BM novelty and BM efficiency resulted in an enhancement of performance among mature SMEs compared to younger SMEs.

(ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents e cient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer’s own and competitors’ stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors’ prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers. Based on the estimates, we propose and test a best-response pricing strategy through a carefully controlled live experiment that lasts five weeks.

The strength of any predictive model depends on the selection of proper predictors. However, despite improvements in acute rejection management and short-term graft survival, the accurate prediction of kidney transplant outcomes remains suboptimal. Among other approaches, machine-learning techniques have the potential to offer solutions to this prediction problem in kidney transplantation. This study offers a novel methodological solution to this prediction problem by: (a) analyzing the retrospective database including > 31,000 U.S. patients; (b) introducing a comprehensive feature selection framework that accounts for medical literature, data analytics methods and elastic net (EN) regression (c) using sensitivity analyses and information fusion to evaluate and combine features from several machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and Bootstrap Forest (BF)); (d) constructing several different scenarios by merging different sets of features that are optioned through these fused data mining models and statistical models in addition to expert knowledge; and (e) using best performing sets in Bayesian belief network (BBN) algorithm to identify non-linear relationships and the interactions between explanatory factors and risk levels for kidney graft survival. The results showed that the predictor set obtained through fused data mining model and literature review outperformed the all other alternative predictors sets with the scores of 0.602, 0.684, 0.495 for F-Measure, Average Accuracy, and G-Mean, respectively. Overall, our findings provide novel insights about risk prediction that could potentially help in improving the outcome of kidney transplants.

To address this gap, this research proposes a theoretical model rooted in institutional and upper echelon theories that explain TQM diffusion via top management commitment. We surveyed 300 senior quality managers representing 300 auto-components manufacturers in India to collect data to test the proposed model using variance based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings suggest that institutional pressures significantly influence top management commitment to TQM. Subsequently, top management commitment influences organisational diffusion of TQM via acceptance, routinisation and assimilation.

We also perform empirical tests with data from the insurance industry and automobile industry to demonstrate the applications of the proposed model in identifying the leader stage in two-stage DEA.

Handling such a large volume of continuously generated online content is a challenging task for buyers, sellers and researchers. The purpose of this study is to rank the overwhelming number of reviews using their predicted helpfulness scores. The helpfulness score is predicted using features extracted from review text, product description, and customer question-answer data of a product using the random-forest classifier and gradient boosting regressor. The system classifies reviews into low or high quality with the random-forest classifier. The helpfulness scores of the high-quality reviews are only predicted using the gradient boosting regressor. The helpfulness scores of the low-quality reviews are not calculated because they are never going to be in the top k reviews. They are just added at the end of the review list to the review-listing website. The proposed system provides fair review placement on review listing pages and makes all high-quality reviews visible to customers on the top. The experimental results on data from two popular Indian e-commerce websites validate our claim, as 3–4 newer high-quality reviews are placed in the top ten reviews along with 5–6 older reviews based on review helpfulness.

In this article we empirically assess the extent to which institutional openness in universities towards UIC linkages affect the generation of knowledge-intensive spin-offs and academic patenting activity in the context of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. We use data for 462 knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial projects related to academics receiving grants from the PIPE Program of the State of São Paulo, Brazil, as well as international patenting behavior for 126 universities and research institutes. Additionally, we have gathered data for UIC activity (2002–2010) in the affected region. The main novelty of our approach is to qualify UIC according to three different dimensions of openness, focusing on UIC levels and objects of collaboration. Results suggest that the quality of linkages (collaboration content) is a stronger predictor of both types of university entrepreneurship than the extent to which universities are connected to firms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Academic spin-offs; Knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship; University-industry collaboration","Decision making; Developing countries; Knowledge management; Patents and inventions; Societies and institutions; Academic entrepreneurship; Academic spin-offs; Entrepreneurial project; Knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship; Patenting activities; Research institutes; University entrepreneurship; University-industry collaboration; Education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014267279

Whereas innovations affect and are affected by organizational behavior, they are better observed at a project level because they are shaped by a network of various project actors. This study connected intra- (micro) and interorganizational (meso) levels of BIM implementation. To explore the relation between BIM adoption drivers and BIM implementation in projects, three case studies were analyzed qualitatively through the theoretical lens of loosely coupled systems. The findings showed that although individual firms had strong external or internal BIM motivations and visions to adopt BIM innovation, the project networks rarely coordinated to support BIM implementation. Consequently, the project networks that were motivated by internal BIM adoption drivers (e.g., quality assurance) implemented BIM collaboratively and flexibly. Contrariwise, networks of firms that adopted BIM simply to comply with external demand (e.g., macroscopic market pressures or client demand) were rigid and competitive during BIM implementation and hindered knowledge transfer and innovation change management. Drawing upon the empirical data, other factors affecting BIM implementation and in need of further interorganizational alignment were corporate compatibility, interfirm knowledge mobility, and interfirm power dynamics. The implication is the need for further alignment of visions about BIM innovation decision making across firms to support effective BIM implementation in projects. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","BIM adoption; BIM implementation; Building information modeling (BIM); Innovation; Loosely coupled; Project networks","Construction industry; Decision making; Information theory; Knowledge management; Quality assurance; BIM adoption; BIM implementation; Building Information Model - BIM; Loosely coupled; Project networks; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050195910

Towards this end, some argue that the characteristics of such policy mixes matter greatly, yet with little empirical evidence backing up such claims. In this paper we explore this link between policy mix characteristics and low-carbon innovation, using the research case of the transition of the German electricity system towards renewable energy. Our empirical insights are based on an innovation survey administered to German manufacturers of renewable power generation technologies which builds on the Community Innovation Survey. For our purposes we adjusted the survey to better capture companies’ perceptions of policy mixes. Employing a bivariate Tobit model we find evidence that companies’ perceptions regarding the consistency and credibility of the policy mix are positively associated with their innovation expenditures for renewable energies, and this positive link intensifies when considering the mutual interdependence of these policy mix characteristics. In contrast, neither the comprehensiveness of the instrument mix nor the coherence of policy processes were found to be related to innovation expenditures. Overall, these findings suggest that future research on low-carbon and eco-innovation should pay greater attention to the characteristics of policy mixes, rather than focusing on policy instruments only. Finally, our findings indicate a need to consider how policy may be measured in innovation surveys to generate better informed policy advice regarding the greening of innovation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coherence; Comprehensiveness; Consistency; Credibility; Decarbonization; Eco-innovation; Policy mix; Renewable energy; Sustainability transition","Carbon; Coherent light; Decarbonization; Comprehensiveness; Consistency; Credibility; Eco-innovation; Renewable energies; Sustainability transition; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047910449

In prior studies, the supply side of remanufacturing supply chain has been vastly brought into focus compared to the demand side. Motivational factors that encourage consumers to purchase remanufactured products are getting firms attentions in developing effective marketing strategies to assist them being more productive in the current competitive market. However, consumer acceptance of remanufactured products has been regarded as one of the main reasons why remanufacturing has remained a majorly untapped opportunity for improving supply chain productivity. This study aims at exploring the major motivational factors for buying a remanufactured bike based on the consumers' and experts' opinions. Firstly, twelve motivations identified by scrutinising the literature. Secondly, single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTNN) and trapezoidal neutrosophic weighted arithmetic averaging (TNWAA) operator were employed to obtain seven significant motivations using the survey data collected from potential customers. This method is applied owing to its capability in capturing the uncertainty of consumers' subjective judgements. Thirdly, the resulted seven motivations are prioritised in accordance with the experts' judgements utilising a proposed modified fuzzy Delphi (FD) method. Ultimately, the most significant motivation to purchase a remanufactured bike identified as quality that suggests quality is the major factor affecting purchase decision of a remanufactured bike. It indicates remanufacturers should focus on quality and attempt to improve the quality of products to gain more competitive advantage. The other six factors that should be stressed by remanufacturer's marketing strategies are prioritised as warranty, price, information provision, remanufacturer's reputation, value-added services and retailer's reputation respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behaviour; Fuzzy Delphi; Fuzzy set theory; Neutrosophic set; Purchase motivation; Remanufacturing","Bicycles; Commerce; Competition; Consumer behavior; Motivation; Sales; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Competitive advantage; End-of-life strategies; Fuzzy Delphi; Information provision; Neutrosophic sets; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing supply chains; Fuzzy set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049335082

By virtue of its capability to produce parts with complex geometry and functionally graded materials, AM has been introduced and used in multiple industrial sectors and is leading the way into the “third industrial revolution”. One of the key considerations in Additively Manufactured Products (AMP) is the issue of sustainability which attracts increasing attention as modern society becomes more aware of environmental concerns. As a response to the growing requirement for sustainability, industries and customers are inclined to assess products and services through the perspective of life cycle sustainability. The integration of life cycle sustainability and AMP is still an open question and is the primary motivation for this study. Since the eventual goal of all advanced technologies is to serve and satisfy human society, social sustainability must be an essential part of all decisions regarding AMP. Limited studies that integrate social sustainability into AMP life cycle analysis is a current research gap in the body of the literature, and thus this paper will address it. The primary merit of this paper is developing a suitable full-dimension sustainability life cycle assessment framework to obtain a fundamental understanding of the performance of AMP life cycle sustainability. The proposed framework applies a more systemic AMP life span including AMP design, AM, usage, and end-of-life (EOL) handling. An AM produced gear is used as an example to illustrate the life cycle sustainability assessment framework. The results show that the AM stage has the highest influence on economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability and the EOL stage has the highest social impact. The results also indicate that AM mass production can significantly reduce the impact of sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy consumption; Life cycle assessment; Social sustainability assessment; Sustainability assessment","3D printers; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Functionally graded materials; Sustainable development; Environmental concerns; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle sustainability assessments; Manufacturing techniques; Products and services; Social sustainability; Sustainability assessment; Third industrial revolutions; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051834076

In particular, new technology enabled features, such as the disclosure of delivery drivers’ identities, introduce a social dimension prior to delivery service encounters that might influence customers’ service quality expectations and ultimately impact their attitudes towards the retailers. Building on premises of social identity theory, this research investigates effects of various crowdsourced delivery system designs related to driver disclosure and ethnicity on customers’ attitudes towards the drivers and retailers. Using data from a scenario-based experiment with 761 participants across two studies, we find that crowdsourced delivery designs that disclose drivers’ identity increase customers’ trust, satisfaction, and repurchase intentions only when customers perceive the drivers to be similar to them, particularly with regard to ethnicity. The designs that offer driver choice options are also found to be highly regarded by customers. In addition, the similarity effects of crowdsourced delivery designs differ depending on certain customer characteristics. Overall, our research shows crowdsourced delivery - as a technology-driven phenomenon - may portend unexpected and challenging social dilemmas for operations managers.

We show that improving an airport's position in the network of air links has a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. We find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, the results suggest that increasing interconnectedness induces links between businesses and generates economic activity at the local level but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally. © The Author(s) 2017.

We compared the performance of judgmental model selection against a standard algorithm based on information criteria. We also examined the efficacy of a judgmental model-build approach, in which experts were asked to decide on the existence of the structural components (trend and seasonality) of the time series instead of directly selecting a model from a choice set. Our behavioral study used data from almost 700 participants, including forecasting practitioners. The results from our experiment suggest that selecting models judgmentally results in performance that is on par, if not better, to that of algorithmic selection. Further, judgmental model selection helps to avoid the worst models more frequently compared to algorithmic selection. Finally, a simple combination of the statistical and judgmental selections and judgmental aggregation significantly outperform both statistical and judgmental selections. © 2018 The Authors","Behavioral operations; Combination; Decomposition; Model selection","Decomposition; Industrial engineering; Operations research; Behavioral operations; Behavioral studies; Combination; Forecasting modeling; Information criterion; Model Selection; Standard algorithms; Structural component; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048531927

This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural productivity; Biodiversity; Endogenous growth; Food security; Land conversion; Population","agricultural development; agricultural economics; agricultural management; agricultural production; biodiversity; crop yield; endogenous growth; environmental assessment; food preference; food security; global perspective; innovation; integrated approach; land use change; population density; productivity; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028559240

In response, Beijing increased the use of natural gas since 2008; therefore, natural gas consumption (NGC) soared rapidly, accounting for over 30% of total energy need in 2016. This study explores the long- and short-run effects of NGC on PM2.5 emissions within the framework of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in Beijing by employing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. To do this, the long-term and monthly PM2.5 data based on ground monitoring are used for the period of April 2008 through December 2016 (2008 M04-2016 M12). The empirical results suggest, in the long run, an inverted U-shaped EKC link exists between PM2.5 emissions and per capita gross domestic product (GDP); with 16,973 yuan for per capita monthly GDP, the EKC will reach its peak. Although the NGC in Beijing can mitigate PM2.5 emissions in both the long run and short run, its mitigation effect would be weakened over time. Furthermore, increasing vehicle quantity would lead to higher concentrations of PM2.5, whereas the proportion of tertiary industry exerts a negative effect on PM2.5 in Beijing. At the end of the article, several key policy implications are highlighted both for mitigating PM2.5 and for promoting growth in natural gas industry in Beijing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Driving forces; Environmental Kuznets curve; Natural gas consumption; PM2.5 emissions","Economics; Gas industry; Natural gas; Particles (particulate matter); Public policy; Beijing; Driving forces; Environmental Kuznets curves; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Gross domestic products; Mitigation effects; Natural gas consumption; Tertiary industries; Gas emissions; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission; emission control; fuel consumption; ground-based measurement; Kuznets curve; megacity; mitigation; natural gas; particle size; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047422722

Although fatal air accidents are rare compared to other transport industries, the rapid growth in air travel demands has resulted in a growing aviation risk exposure and new challenges in the aviation sector. Although the issue of airline safety is of serious public concern, notably few studies have investigated the safety efficiency of airlines. This paper aims to propose a novel hybrid method using fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) and fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (F-MADM) for ranking the airlines’ safety. In this study, fuzzy DEA is utilized to calculate criteria weights, in contrast to the conventional approach of using DEA for measuring the efficiency of alternatives. A ranking of each airline (DMU) on the basis of obtained weights is then assessed using MADM methods. Six MADM methods including Fuzzy SAW, Fuzzy TOPSIS, Fuzzy VIKOR, ARAS-F, COPRAS-F and Fuzzy MULTIMOORA are implemented to rank the alternatives, and finally, the results are compounded with the utility interval technique. This new hybrid method can efficiently overcome the pitfalls of traditional hybrid DEA-MADM models. The method proposed in this study is used to evaluate the safety levels of seven Iranian airlines and to select the safest one. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Airline safety; Fuzzy DEA; Fuzzy MADM; Utility interval","accident; air transportation; airline industry; data envelopment analysis; decision making; transportation safety; travel demand; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053513267

Dimension reduction is often utilized in non-parametric density and regression where similar problems occur, but has been used in only a few instances in the context of efficiency estimation. This paper explains why the problem occurs in nonparametric models of production and proposes three diagnostics for when dimension reduction might lead to more accurate estimation of efficiency. Simulation results provide additional insight, and suggest that in many cases dimension reduction is advantageous in terms of reducing estimation error. The simulation results also suggest that when dimensionality is reduced, free-disposal hull estimators become an attractive, viable alternative to the more frequently used (and more restrictive) data envelopment analysis estimators. In the context of efficiency estimation, these results provide the first quantification of the tradeoff between information lost versus improvement in estimation error due to dimension reduction. Results from several papers in the literature are revisited to show what might be gained from reducing dimensionality and how interpretations might differ. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DEA; Dimension reduction; Dimensionality; Efficiency; FDH","Data envelopment analysis; Accurate estimation; Dimension reduction; Dimensionality; Efficiency estimation; Estimation errors; Free disposal hulls; Input and outputs; Non-parametric model; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038821499

As is common in practice, we assume the demand function contains unknown parameters that must be learned from sales data. In the presence of these unknown demand parameters, the retailer faces a trade-off commonly referred to as the “exploration-exploitation trade-off.” Toward the beginning of the selling season, the retailer may offer several different prices to try to learn demand at each price (“exploration” objective). Over time, the retailer can use this knowledge to set a price that maximizes revenue throughout the remainder of the selling season (“exploitation” objective). We propose a class of dynamic pricing algorithms that builds on the simple, yet powerful, machine learning technique known as “Thompson sampling” to address the challenge of balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off under the presence of inventory constraints. Our algorithms have both strong theoretical performance guarantees and promising numerical performance results when compared with other algorithms developed for similar settings. Moreover, we show how our algorithms can be extended for use in general multiarmed bandit problems with resource constraints as well as in applications in other revenue management settings and beyond. © 2018 INFORMS.","Demand learning; Dynamic pricing; Machine learning; Multiarmed bandit; Revenue management; Thompson sampling","Balancing; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Functions; Learning systems; Sales; Demand learning; Dynamic pricing; Multi armed bandit; Revenue management; Thompson samplings; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061569194

Several studies have highlighted the need to maintain and build manufacturing capabilities to support economic growth and have linked a nation's as well as region's strength in manufacturing to its ability to innovate. In the U.S., where a manufacturing strategy has largely been absent for the past 25 years, advanced manufacturing capabilities are now seen as essential to the development of new products and processes across a range of industries. Against this backdrop, Massachusetts presents an interesting case since manufacturing in this U.S. state is integral to several of its most important industry clusters, yet it is a high wage, high costs state that must compete globally. This research examines the pathways and opportunities for building and fostering innovation capacity among Massachusetts manufacturers, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We employ a systems approach to conduct analytic and empirical analyses that consider how knowledge and sources of innovation flow between key participants within the manufacturing innovation ecosystem. We find that the Massachusetts manufacturing innovation ecosystem is rich in terms of assets but relatively poor in terms of interconnectedness between those assets. In addition, rather than being focused on demand-driven innovation and technological upgrading for SMEs, non-market state-supported manufacturing intermediaries are primarily focused on supply-side, point solutions that work with individual firms rather than at a systems level. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Advanced manufacturing; Innovation; Massachusetts; Regional innovation ecosystems","Economics; Ecosystems; Regional planning; Advanced manufacturing; Manufacturing capability; Manufacturing innovation; Manufacturing strategy; Massachusetts; Regional innovation; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Sources of innovation; Manufacture; corporate strategy; economic growth; innovation; manufacturing; regional economy; small and medium-sized enterprise; technological development; Massachusetts; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044174788

Evaluation results show that even if all electricity-generating units in each region were able to adopt the best practice, the nationwide 18% intensity reduction target is not feasible through improving technical efficiency or upgrading technology on electricity generation and carbon abatement in a short or medium term.

Customers may be reluctant to purchase products they have not been able to try on and those customers who do purchase may return products when they do not fit as expected. Virtual fitting-room technologies provide information about how a product fits a particular customer and promise to mitigate some of the frictions the information gap generates in the retailers’ supply chains. By implementing a series of randomized field experiments, we study the value of virtual fit information in online retail. In our experiments, customers are randomly assigned to a treatment condition where virtual fit information is available or to a control condition where virtual fit information is not available. Our results show that o ering virtual fit information increases conversion rates and order value, and reduces fulfillment costs arising from returns and home try-on behavior, that is, customers ordering multiple sizes of the same product. We explore mechanisms through which providing virtual fit information helps customers and retailers. We argue that the virtual fitting tool creates spillovers even to products that are not available for virtual try-on, increases loyalty, helps customers better parse their choice sets, and reduces uncertainty by providing size recommendation. © 2018 INFORMS.","Digital retail; Fit uncertainty; Online retail; Randomized field experiment; Supply chain information; Virtual fitting room","Friction; Supply chains; Digital retail; Field experiment; Fit uncertainty; Online retails; Virtual fitting room; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052732276

Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have the potential to lessen the carbon emission and gasoline consumption in order to alleviate environmental problems. Consequently, attempts are being initiated to popularise the use of PHEVs as the main mode of transportation. The diffusion of PHEV adoption is a positive initiative. A sample of 403 respondents has been collected from Malaysia in order to forecast the customer's intention to adopt PHEVs by using the extended theory of planned behaviour. The empirical outcome using the PLS investigation exposed that all four constructs, subjective norm, personal moral norm, perceived behavioural control, and attitude ominously shows an indirect effect which has inclined towards the Malaysian consumers’ intention to adopt PHEVs. All these four major constructs were significantly predetermined by their respective environmental concern. Whereas, hyperbolic discounting moderated the relationship between intention and adoption. The fostering result verifies that the relevance of the extended TPB had a good explanatory power in the line of predicting the Malaysian consumers’ intention to adopt PHEVs. For future study, grounded by the observed outcome, authors explain the implication aimed at promoting the PHEV adoption. © 2018","Adoption; Consumer behaviour; Empirical study; Environmental concern; Hyperbolic discounting; PHEV","Carbon; Consumer behavior; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Adoption; Empirical studies; Environmental concerns; Hyperbolic discounting; PHEV; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; emission control; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; transportation mode; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046352967

Larger organisations not saddled with financial and socio-technical constraints might be considered as being among the “Early Majority” or “Innovators”. It is crucial to understand how these organisations differ in their speed of BIM technology adoption and the rationale for this difference. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential causes of the digital divide and suggest solutions for bridging the gap. Design/methodology/approach: Using mixed research method, data were collected through online questionnaire survey of over 240 global respondents as well as a semi-structured interview with nine experts for which statistical and thematic analyses were used, respectively. Findings: Organisations can be zoned into “layers” and “levels” of BIM technology adoption and their size is not always significant in terms of the speed at which they adopt BIM. The digital divide is unequal across layers/levels and large organisations utilise technologies across the BIM maturity levels depending on project circumstances. A conceptual model for BIM technology was developed to aid identification of the “Laggards” and “Late Majority” from the “Innovators” through which change agents can customise adoption strategies for each group. Originality/value: The developed model could serve as a tool for engagement and policy making and it contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of BIM technology adoption. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Building information modelling; Innovation; Organization; Technology","Information theory; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Architecture , engineering and construction industries; Body of knowledge; Building Information Modelling; Design/methodology/approach; Online questionnaire; Semi structured interviews; Technology adoption; Thematic analysis; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052560240

Some of the main reasons for this difficulty are directly related to the complexity inherent in the multiplicity of criteria that must be considered in such an evaluation, as well as the subjectivity intrinsic to the issue under study. This complexity hinders the development of models capable of reflecting the performance of different urban environments in terms of their QoL. This study sought to overcome some of the more common limitations of current evaluation methods, by combining cognitive mapping and the measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH), to develop a more informed, coherent and transparent evaluation system. The resulting framework and its application were validated both by the participating panel of experts and a representative of the parliamentary group of the Portuguese ecologist party “The Greens”. The advantages and limitations of our framework are also subject of analysis and discussion.

We highlight a need for greater recognition, particularly by disaster management and response agencies, of uncertainty as a subjective experience for those living at risk. Embodied uncertainty is distinguished from objective uncertainty by the nature of its internalisation at the individual level, where it is subjective, felt and directly experienced. This approach provides a conceptual pathway that sharpens knowledge of the processes that shape how individuals and communities interpret and contextualise risk. The ways in which individual characteristics, social identities and lived experiences shape interpretations of risk are explored by considering embodied uncertainty in four contexts: social identities and trauma, the co-production of knowledge, institutional structures and policy and long-term lived experiences. We conclude by outlining the opportunities that this approach presents, and provide recommendations for further research on how the concept of embodied uncertainty can aid decision-making and the management of risks in the context of extreme natural hazards. © 2016 The Author(s).

Prior research has focused largely on computational approaches to improving recommendation accuracy, and only recently researchers have started to study their behavioral implications and potential side effects.We used three controlled experiments, in the context of purchasing digital songs, to explore the willingness-to-pay judgments of individual consumers after being shown personalized recommendations. In Study 1, we found strong evidence that randomly assigned song recommendations affected participants' willingness to pay, even when controlling for participants' preferences and demographics. In Study 2, participants viewed actual system-generated recommendations that were intentionally perturbed (introducing recommendation error), andwe observed similar effects. In Study 3,we showed that the influence of personalized recommendations on willingness-to-pay judgments was obtained even when preference uncertainty was reduced through immediate and mandatory song sampling prior to pricing.

We observe an interesting gender effect with respect to how patients trade off speed (delay to care) and quality (doctor of choice), and demonstrate that risk attitudes mediate the impact of gender on the perception of speed and quality. Specifically, females (versus males) are more averse to not seeing their own doctor, and, when delay to care is relatively long, females perceive greater utility loss than males. As many operational strategies in outpatient care aim to improve the patient experience by making trade-offs between speed and quality, we make suggestions for when managers should intervene to improve their practice and how such interventions might look based on the patient mix and current delay level. © 2017 INFORMS.","Appointment scheduling; Consumer choice behavior; Discrete choice experiment; Healthcare management; Operations management","Consumer behavior; Economic and social effects; Patient treatment; Risk perception; Appointment scheduling; Consumer choice; Discrete choice experiments; Health-care managements; Operations management; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047247732

Following the decomposition-reconstruction-prediction concept, a combined Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-Least Square Support Vector Machine-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA) model is proposed for quantitatively analyzing and forecasting coal overcapacity in China. The results show that the main causes of coal overcapacity in China include insufficient demand, market failure, and institutional distortion. Institutional distortion, with an influence degree of 73.75%, is the most fundamental and influential factor. From 2017 to 2019, the scale of coal overcapacity in China will reach between 1.721and 1.819 billion tons, suggesting that coal overcapacity will remain a serious problem. The rate of coal overcapacity caused by insufficient demand will fluctuate slightly, while coal overcapacity caused by market failure will trend downward, but the impact of institutional distortion on coal overcapacity will be exacerbated.

The e-tailer faces a joint pricing and fulfillment (JPF) optimization problem: at the beginning of each period, the e-tailer needs to jointly decide the price for each product and how to fulfill an incoming order (i.e., from which warehouse to ship the order). The objective of the e-tailer is to maximize its total expected profits defined as total expected revenues minus total expected shipping costs. (All other costs are fixed in this problem.) The exact optimal policy for JPF is difficult to solve; so, we propose two heuristic controls that have provably good performance compared to reasonable benchmarks. Our first heuristic control directly uses the solution of a deterministic approximation of JPF as its control parameters. Our second heuristic control improves the first one by adaptively adjusting the original control parameters according to the realized demand. An important feature of the second heuristic control is that it decouples the real-time pricing and fulfillment decisions, making it easy to implement. We show theoretically and numerically that the second heuristic control significantly outperforms the first heuristic control and is very close to a benchmark that jointly reoptimizes the full deterministic problem at the beginning of every period. © 2018 INFORMS.","Asymptotic analysis; Dynamic pricing; E-commerce retail; Fulfillment policies","Asymptotic analysis; Benchmarking; Electronic commerce; Optimization; Sales; Ships; Control parameters; Deterministic approximation; Deterministic problems; Dynamic pricing; Heuristic control; Important features; Optimization problems; Real time pricing; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047163868

Building on this “open paradox” framework, this study investigates whether societal trust—a key aspect of informal cultural norms—serves as an effective mechanism in improving relational governance among partners, thereby leading to better collaborative outcomes. Using a novel panel data on co-owned patents across 29 countries, we show that firms in high trust countries are able to produce a higher level of joint output (i.e., co-owned patents). This effect is more pronounced when perceived opportunism is higher (i.e., firms in high-tech industries, or in countries with less disclosure transparency), and when formal contracts are less enforceable (i.e., in countries with relatively weak legal systems). We further show that open innovation is the channel through which societal trust promotes innovative efficiency. Overall, our study establishes societal trust as a key factor in influencing the efficiency of open innovation. © 2018","Innovative efficiency; Open innovation; Social capital; Societal trust","Competition; Efficiency; Telecommunication industry; Competitive advantage; Effective mechanisms; External knowledge; High tech industry; Open innovation; Relational governances; Social capitals; Societal trust; Patents and inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051556758

Although many researchers have proposed visualization methods to find technology opportunities, little attention has been paid to present detailed directions of technology development with specified characteristics of technology. Thus, this research aims to suggest a systematic approach to conducting technology opportunity analysis by visualizing patent information, such as patent documents and citation relationships. First, keywords that explain core concepts, functions, and so on are extracted from collected patent documents by text mining. Second, patents are visualized in a two-dimensional space, and vacant cells are identified with their estimated keyword vectors by generative topographic mapping (GTM). Third, since many vacant cells will be potential candidates for developing new technologies, link prediction tools can choose promising vacant cells to connect existing cells with potential, but not yet existent, cells. Finally, the results of prediction are tested by comparing the predicted cells with the actual developed cells. The research reported in this paper is based in three technologies that have emerging, stable, and declining patterns, in order to illustrate the proposed approach, and investigate in which types it is relevant. It is found that the proposed approach provided a good prediction performance in the case of a technology that has a stable pattern. In addition, among link prediction methods, a semantic similarity-based approach showed better prediction results than a machine learning technique due to modest data availability for training. Thus, the results of this research can help R&D managers plan and evaluate R&D projects for technology development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","GTM; Link prediction; Patent information; Technology opportunity analysis; Visualization","Cells; Cytology; Data mining; Flow visualization; Learning systems; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Patents and inventions; Personnel training; Semantics; Vector spaces; Visualization; Generative topographic mapping; Link prediction; Machine learning techniques; Patent information; Prediction performance; Technology development; Technology opportunities; Two dimensional spaces; Forecasting; industrial technology; machine learning; performance assessment; research and development; research work; technological development; technology adoption; topographic mapping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042034236

Consumer switching generates inefficiency in the process of matching advertisers to consumers, because advertisers may not reach some consumers and may impress others too many times. We find that when advertisers are heterogeneous in their valuations for reaching consumers, the switchinginduced inefficiency leads lower-value advertisers to advertise on a limited set of publishers, reducing the effective demand for advertising and thus depressing prices. As the share of switching consumers expands (e.g., when consumers adopt the Internet for news or increase their use of aggregators), ad prices fall.We demonstrate that increased switching creates an incentive for publishers to invest in quality as well as extend the number of unique users, because larger publishers are favored by advertisers seeking broader ""reach"" (more unique users) while avoiding inefficient duplication. © 2016 INFORMS.","Advertising; Matching; Media; Multi-homing; Newspapers; Platforms; Single-homing; Switching; Tracking; Two-sided markets","Commerce; Marketing; Surface discharges; Switching; Matching; Media; Multi-homing; Newspapers; Platforms; Single-homing; Two-sided markets; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045181868

We employ a two-stage stochastic integer programming model, in the first stage of which we allocate shared vehicle fleet and purchase parking lots or permits in reservation-based or free-floating systems. In the second stage, we generate a finite set of samples to represent demand uncertainty and construct a spatial-temporal network for each sample to model vehicle movement and the corresponding rental revenue, operating cost, and penalties from unserved demand. We minimize the expected total costs minus profit and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with mixed-integer, rounding-enhanced Benders cuts, which can significantly improve computation efficiency when implemented in parallel computing.

It has been widely applied in real-world scenarios, and traditional DEA models with a limited number of variables and linear constraints can be computed easily. However, DEA using big data involves huge numbers of DMUs, which may increase the computational load to beyond what is practical with traditional DEA methods. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms to accelerate the computation process in the big data environment. Specifically, we firstly use an algorithm to divide the large scale DMUs into small scale and identify all strongly efficient DMUs. If the strongly efficient DMU set is not too large, we can use the efficient DMUs as a sample set to evaluate the efficiency of inefficient DMUs. Otherwise, we can identify two reference points as the sample in the situation of just one input and one output. Furthermore, a variant of the algorithm is presented to handle cases with multiple inputs or multiple outputs, in which some of the strongly efficient DMUs are reselected as a reduced-size sample set to precisely measure the efficiency of inefficient DMUs. Last, we test the proposed methods on simulated data in various scenarios. © 2017","Big data; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making unit; Large-scale computation","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Computation process; Computational loads; Decision making unit; Efficiency evaluation; Large scale computation; Linear constraints; Real-world scenario; Relative efficiency; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021332256

Markets work best if they enjoy social support, but some markets are repugnant in the sense that some people think they should be banned, even though others want to participate in them. Laws banning such markets often contribute to the design of illegal black markets, and this raises new issues for market designers.

A dominant “normative” perspective has focused on rational processes by which consumers with stable preferences for privacy weigh the expected benefits of privacy choices against their potential costs. More recently, a behavioral perspective has leveraged theories from decision research to construe privacy decision making as a process in which cognitive heuristics and biases predictably occur. In a series of experiments, we compare the predictive power of these two perspectives by evaluating the impact of changes in the objective risk of disclosure and the impact of changes in the relative perceptions of risk of disclosure on both hypothetical and actual consumer privacy choices. We find that both relative and objective risks can, in fact, influence consumer privacy decisions. However, and surprisingly, the impact of objective changes in risk diminishes between hypothetical and actual choice settings. Vice versa, the impact of relative risk becomes more pronounced going from hypothetical to actual choice settings. Our results suggest a way to integrate diverse streams of the information systems literature on privacy decision making: in hypothetical choice contexts, relative to actual choice contexts, consumers may both overestimate their response to normative factors and underestimate their response to behavioral factors. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Among the vast available literature on performance analysis, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has become a popular and practical approach for assessing the relative efficiency of Decision-Making Units (DMUs) which employ multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. However, in addition to inputs and outputs, some situations might include certain factors to simultaneously play the role of both inputs and outputs. Contrary to conventional DEA models which account for precise values for inputs, outputs and dual-role factors, we develop a methodology for quantitatively handling imprecision and uncertainty where a degree of imprecision is not trivial to be ignored in efficiency analysis. In this regard, we first construct a pair of interval DEA models based on the pessimistic and optimistic standpoints to measure the interval efficiencies where some or all observed inputs, outputs and dual-role factors are assumed to be characterized by interval measures. The optimal multipliers associated with the dual-role factors are then used to determine whether a factor is designated as an output, an input, or is in equilibrium even though the status of the dual-role factors may not be unique based upon the pessimistic and optimistic standpoints. To deal with the problem, we present a new model which integrates both pessimistic and optimistic models. The integrated model enables us to identify a unique status of each imprecise dual-role factor as well as to develop a structure for calculating an optimal reallocation model of each dual-role factor among the DMUs. As another method to investigate the role for dual-role factors, we introduce a fuzzy decision-making model which evaluates all DMUs simultaneously. We finally present an application to a data set of 20 banks to showcase the applicability and efficacy of the proposed procedures and algorithm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bank industry; Dual-role factors; Efficiency evaluation; Fuzzy decision-making; Imprecise data","decision making; model; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020479679

In particular, showing sales information to a customer can increase certainty about product quality, inducing consumers to herd. This effect can be particularly salient for experience goods due to their quality being inherently highly uncertain. Social media word-of-mouth (WOM) can increase product awareness as product information spreads via social media, increasing demand directly while amplifying existing quality signals such as past sales. This study examines the mechanisms behind the strategy of facilitating herding and the strategy of integrating social media platforms to understand the potential complementarities between the two strategies. We conduct empirical analysis using data from Groupon.com, which sells goods in a fast cycle format of ""daily deals."" We find that facilitating herding and integrating social media platforms are complements that generate sales, supporting the idea that it is beneficial to combine the two strategies on social media platforms. Furthermore, we find that herding is more salient for experience goods, consistent with our hypothesized mechanisms, while the effect of social media WOM is similar for experience goods and search goods.

This is albeit the understanding that construction waste could be significantly reduced through design activities. This study investigates the underlying design measures that are capable of minimising waste generated by construction and demolition activities. Using exploratory sequential mixed method research, the study employs focus group discussions and thematic analysis at the exploratory phase, while questionnaire and structural equation modelling were used at the explanatory stage of the study. The study suggests that construction waste could be significantly reduced by designing for standard materials size and by designing for modern method of construction, thereby minimising waste due to breakage, materials leftover and other major causes of waste. The study further suggests that the design process and design documentation are key underlying measures for mitigating waste in construction projects. This could be enhanced through such critical success factors as a collaborative delivery process, which is characterised by early involvement of contractors and adequate coordination of design between various disciplines involved.

This important technological innovation, initiated by emerging Internet companies, is helping the traditional financial industry's payment business—represented by commercial banks—expand in both depth and breadth. Meanwhile, there is also a large degree of substitution, competition and crowding out among these banks in terms of the traditional financial industry's basic payment and settlement functions, potential customers, deposit and loan services and traditional intermediary business. This paper explores the impact (episodic and long-term steady-state) of the technological innovation of payment on commercial banks. It also considers the impact of technological innovation on industrial evolution to clarify whether technological innovation offsets the advantages of traditional industries or promotes industrial development. This study adopts the Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) impulse response model to analyze the impact of Internet Third-Party Payment (TPP) on the traditional financial industry from 2007 to 2014. The empirical results suggest that in China, third-party payments have had a significant positive correlation with the value creation capabilities of traditional financial industries, and that this relationship tends to remain in a steady state in the long term. Based on these findings, this paper confirms that the technological innovation of methods of payment in emerging economies, such as China, has promoted the development of the financial industry and accelerated the process of industrial evolution.

Drawing from organizational learning theory, this article examines (1) how collaboration with domestic partners assists in the formation of collaborations with foreign partners, (2) how knowledge from these collaborations is associated with product innovation at different levels of novelty, and (3) how the relationship between the level of innovation novelty and firm growth is influenced by whether the focal firm engages in open or closed innovation and the origin of the collaborator (foreign or domestic). Three key findings emerge from the econometric analysis of a sample of 1684 Taiwanese firms. First, domestic collaborations assist in the formation of foreign collaborations when the partner type is the same. Second, the level of innovation novelty is associated with the type and geographic location of partners. This study differentiates among noninnovating firms, incremental innovators, and radical innovators and demonstrates that the role of partners changes as the number of countries in which a firm collaborates with each partner type increases.

This paper assesses the environmental efficiency of Chinese regional industrial systems to come up with some recommendations to policy makers. First, we divided each Chinese regional industrial system into a production process and a pollutant treatment process. Then, we built a scientific input-intermediate-output index system by introducing a new network slacks-based model (NSBM) model. This study is the first to combine NSBM with DEA window analysis to give a dynamic evaluation of the environmental efficiency. This enables us to assess the environmental efficiency of Chinese regional industrial systems considering their internal structure as well as Chinas policies concerning resource utilization and environmental protection. Hence, the overall efficiency of each regional industrial system is decomposed into production efficiency and pollutant treatment efficiency. Our empirical results suggest: (1) 66.7% of Chinese regional industrial systems are overall inefficient. 63.3 and of 66.7% Chinese regional industrial systems are inefficient in the production process and the pollutant treatment process, respectively. (2) The efficiency scores for the overall system and both processes are all larger in the eastern area of China than those of the central and western areas. (3) Correlation analysis indicates that SO2 generation intensity (SGI), solid waste generation intensity, COD discharge intensity, and SO2 discharge intensity have significantly negative impacts on the overall efficiency. (4) The overall inefficiency is mainly due to inefficiency of the pollutant treatment process for the majority of regional industrial systems. (5) In general, the overall efficiency was trending up from 2004 to 2010, indicating that the substantial efforts China has devoted to protecting the environment have yielded benefits. © 2017 Operational Research Society.","Chinese industrial systems; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Environmental performance; Network SBM model; Window analysis","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Environmental management; Pollution; Environmental efficiency; Environmental performance; Environmental performance evaluations; Environmental problems; Industrial systems; SBM models; Solid waste generation; Window analysis; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021114529

This paper addresses the problem of adequately measuring service quality using socialized data. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical basis for the study is the widely used SERVQUAL model and we leverage a dataset uniquely suited for the analysis: the full database of online reviews generated on the website of the leading price comparison engine in Italy. Adopting a weakly supervised topic model, we extract the dimensions of service quality from these reviews. We use a linear regression to compare service quality dimensions between positive and negative opinions. Findings: First, we show that socialized textual data, not just quantitative ratings, provide a wealth of customer service information that can be used to measure service quality. Second, we demonstrate that the distribution of topics in online opinions differs significantly between positive and negative reviews. Specifically, we find that concerns about merchant responsiveness dominate negative reviews. Practical implications: Our research has important implications for designers of online review systems and marketers seeking novel approaches to the measurement of service quality. Our study shows that evaluation systems designed considering the knowledge extracted directly from customers’ review lead to a service quality measurement that not only is theory-based, but also more accurate. Originality/value: We believe this is the first study to combine the advanced text mining technique of topic modeling and SERVQUAL to extract specific service dimensions from socialized data. Using these advanced techniques, we point to systematic differences between positive and negative customer opinions.

We theorize that peer firm CEO charisma enhances the focal firm’s imitation of peer firms’ behaviors, while peer firm CEO narcissism diminishes it. We further posit that the uncertainty of the context affects these imitation processes: industry dynamism and prior experience in a given strategic domain, respectively, strengthens and dampens focal firms’ susceptibility to these peer CEOs’ attributes. We test and find support for these ideas using a longitudinal sample of Fortune 500 firms in two distinct domains, corporate strategy and corporate social responsibility. Managerial Summary: When companies are uncertain about the costs and benefits of strategic actions this may lead them to imitate the actions of peer companies. But given the uncertainty, the challenge for executives is: which companies to emulate and which to ignore? In a sample of Fortune 500 companies, we find that the charisma or narcissism of a peer company’s CEO positively or negatively influences, respectively, the degree to which the peer company’s strategic actions are imitated. We reason that this is because these particular CEO attributes are widely believed to drive leadership effectiveness or ineffectiveness, respectively. We also find that the effects of these CEO characteristics on imitation are stronger in dynamic industry environments and weaker for companies that already have experience with the given strategy.

This paper situates the ICO's guidance in the context of wider legal and ethical considerations and provides a critique of the position adopted by the ICO.

This shift reflects the potential for artificial intelligence to have negative social consequences (whether intended or unintended) that are not otherwise addressed by the GDPR.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual/argumentative. As such, it draws on research on (e-)commerce, theories of markets, disruptive innovation and extant studies and conceptual work at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, machine-to-machine commerce and the Internet of Things. Findings: The authors highlight three application areas for blockchains, whereby they can function as applications, can help develop autonomous economic agents and can lead the development of decentralised autonomous organisations. With regards to the question of market disintermediation, the authors suggest that, rather than complete disintermediation, the most probable scenario is that of new types of intermediaries finding previously unthinkable roles to play in mediating blockchain-based economic transactions. With regards to the inhibitors that slow down the technology’s adoption and, therefore, the development of new business applications, the authors posit that these relate mainly to the inherent risk of the technology, infrastructure requirements, scepticism of early decision makers and the lack of required new skills and competencies. Originality/value: The authors examine how new forms of digital money and technologies embedding trust in decentralised networks will alter markets and commerce, at a time when many regulatory issues remain unresolved; in doing so, the authors focus on how blockchain-enabled technologies can be used to enable and further develop decentralised trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger systems and applications and lead to sustainable business models. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; Disintermediation; Disruptive technology; Distributed autonomous corporations; Distributed ledger technology; Smart contracts","Autonomous agents; Blockchain; Decision making; Electronic money; Business applications; Design/methodology/approach; Disintermediation; Disruptive innovations; Disruptive technology; Economic transactions; Smart contracts; Sustainable business; Peer to peer networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044579220

Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors' queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations Erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition.

Extensive work has appeared for realizing the role of DEA in the aspect of assessing portfolio performance and deriving the relative rankings. However, the role of providing realizable benchmarks is not fully explored in the existing literatures. Most importantly, the DEA-based portfolio performance evaluation methods developed in the existing literatures can hardly provide support for fund managers in pursuing sustainability performance. In this paper, we first propose a DEA frontier improvement approach under the mean-variance framework. This approach provides investor with a rebalancing strategy as well as an improved DEA frontier which approximates the portfolio efficient frontier better than the traditional DEA model does. Then, this approach is extended to a general return-risk framework. Our in-sample simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a wide range of applications. In addition, the out-of-sample tests show that the rebalancing investment strategies can achieve higher Sharpe ratios and Sortino ratios than those of the original ones. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to evaluate mutual fund performance in China with the consideration of sustainability information disclosure. We construct a disclosure index to indicate the extent of sustainable information disclosure of each mutual fund. The results show that the proposed approach provides not only investment recommendations, but also references for constructing sustainable green funds. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; DEA frontier improvement; Out-of-sample evaluation; Portfolio performance evaluation; Sustainability information disclosure","Data envelopment analysis; Investments; DEA frontier improvement; Information disclosure; Investment strategy; Out-of-sample evaluation; Portfolio performance evaluation; Relative performance; Sustainability informations; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025139770

In this paper, we propose a new DEA-based analysis framework with a regression-based feedback mechanism, where regression analysis provides DEA with feedback that informs about the relevance of the inputs and the outputs chosen by the analyst. Unlike previous studies, the DEA models used within the proposed framework could use both inputs and outputs, only inputs, or only outputs. So far, the UK banking sector remains relatively under researched despite its crucial importance to the UK economy. We use the proposed framework to address several research questions related to both the efficiency of the UK commercial banking sector and DEA analyses with and without regression-based feedback. Empirical results suggest that, on average, the commercial banks operating in the UK—whether domestic or foreign—are yet to achieve acceptable levels of overall technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and scale efficiency. On the other hand, DEA analyses with and without a linear regression-based feedback mechanism seem to provide consistent findings; however, in general DEA analyses without feedback tend to over- or under-estimate efficiency scores depending on the orientation of the analyses. Furthermore, in general, a linear regression-based feedback mechanism proves effective at improving discrimination in DEA analyses unless the initial choice of inputs and outputs is well informed. © 2018, The Author(s).","Data envelopment analysis; DEA models without explicit inputs; DEA models without explicit outputs; Efficiency; UK commercial banks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045033441

Such behaviors include extended and innovative feature use, both of which are exploratory in nature and can lead to improved work performance. Since these exploratory behaviors can be risky, research has directed attention to trust in technology as an antecedent to post-adoptive IT use. In parallel, research has examined how computer self-efficacy relates to post-adoptive IT use. While such research has found that both trust and efficacy can lead to value-added IT use and that they might do so interdependently, scant research has examined the interplay between these antecedents to post-adoptive IT use. Drawing on the Model of Proactive Work Behavior with a focus on its predictions about trust and efficacy, we develop a research model that integrates trust in technology and computer self-efficacy in the post-adoption context. Our model suggests that the two concepts are interdependent such that trust-related impacts on post-adoptive use behaviors unfold via computer-related self-efficacy beliefs. Contemporary tests of mediation on data from more than 350 respondents provided support for our model. Hence, our findings begin to open the black box by which trust-related impacts on post-adoptive behaviors unfold, revealing computer self-efficacy as an important mediating factor. In doing so, this study furthers understanding of how, and why, trust matters in post-adoptive usage, enabling strategic change management by elucidating the “fit” between technological characteristics and post-adoptive usage. © 2017 The Authors","Computer self-efficacy; Continued use; Deep structure usage; Post-adoptive use; Trust in technology; Trying to innovate","Information systems; Management information systems; Computer self-efficacy; Continued use; Deep structure; Post-adoptive use; Trust in technologies; Trying to innovate; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030675951

Conventional wisdom in strategic management holds that such differences in managerial cognitions lead to higher-quality strategic decisions, and thus to enhanced firm performance. However, 4 decades of empirical research have not provided consistent findings or clear insights into the effects of strategic dissent. Hence, we analyze the relative validity of predictions about these effects from both social psychological theories of group behavior and information processing perspectives on decision-making. Then, we conduct a meta-analytic path analysis (MASEM) based on current empirical evidence. Synthesizing data from 78 articles, we put to rest the notion that strategic dissent leads to positive outcomes for organizations and estimate how negative its effects actually are. Managerial summary: Top management teams (TMTs) set the tone and direction for their firms in important ways. Top managers, however, often disagree over fundamental issues related to strategy. Such strategic dissent affects how important decisions are made, and thus how the firm performs. In more specific terms and contrary to popular belief, strategic dissent creates not only dysfunctional relationships among top managers, but also disrupts the process by which these managers exchange, discuss, and integrate information and ideas in making strategic decisions. In short, firms have not yet generated value through numerous perspectives, ideas, and opinions among their top managers. We discuss interventions that could prove helpful in efforts to benefit from having diverse cognitions in a TMT.

This paper departs from the existing literature by exploring the transmission channels from FDI to growth. The results, based on a sample of developed and developing countries over the period 1970–2007, conclusively reveal that FDI affects growth via inputs accumulation but not the total factor productivity growth channel.

Our perspectives are based on fundamental similarities between natural and business systems. We suggest that innovation ecosystems can be defined as pathways of interlinked business models. Pathways are characterised by the flows they convey not the types of business model that support the flows. These pathways convey material and informational resources, as well as value. Like the nutrient and energy pathways in natural ecosystems. Pathways help to recycle scarce resources such as customer attention and customer-derived information. Business model descriptions are similar to an organism's genome in that they describe limitations on sensing, acting and understanding. We conceptualise this as the ‘umwelt’; the self-world. These limitations have implications for how firms and customers interact with customers. They have other implications for how firms interact with each other in business model communities and how they accommodate each other. We illustrate and test these ecological perspectives using a case study of a healthcare smartphone app's ecosystem. We find that our perspectives can be used as novel methods of studying interactions between business models; or to study ecosystem building. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Complementary umwelts; Digital ecosystems, business models; Ecology theory; Innovation ecosystems; Value creation systems","mHealth; Sales; Business modeling; Business models; Business systems; Complementary umwelts; Natural ecosystem; Scarce resources; Smartphone app; Value creation systems; Ecosystems; business development; ecological theory; ecosystem approach; environmental economics; innovation; numerical model; research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048737117

The main aim of the research was to identify the extent to which the revealed travel behavioural outcomes of the study participants are due to personal social constraints or environmental conditions in their residential locations. Specifically, we sought to identify if the greater access to local amenities and public transport services of inner city residents led to an increase in their daily travel activities when compared with their urban peripheral counterparts. The research analysed data from a personal travel survey and one-day travel diary with 502 adults aged between 16 and 65 years in two different deprived areas in Merseyside, North West England. Our analysis is somewhat hampered by the small sample size, but the modelled results suggest that more trips, and longer journey distances do not necessarily imply greater social inclusion. The geographically weighted regression models (GWR) highlighted that the physical location of where people live within the city is more influential on their trip-making patterns than social determinants such as household income, age, gender, and/or employment status. Street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety were all particularly significant for determining spatial variations in the daily trips that were undertaken, with more trips being undertaken where there was a greater density of street nodes, bus stops and where people felt safer at night. This highlights the need for local transport and urban policymakers to carefully consider and target these micro-scale factors when attempting to introduce transport interventions to reduce social exclusion amongst low-income urban populations. © 2018",,"Bus transportation; Economic and social effects; Location; Regression analysis; Environmental conditions; Geographically weighted regression models; Personal travel surveys; Physical locations; Public transport service; Residential locations; Social disadvantages; Street connectivity; Urban transportation; bus transport; low income population; neighborhood; poverty; transportation safety; travel behavior; urban transport; England; Merseyside; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050826822

As such, the government often intervenes with the way private enterprises conduct business through many different forms of environmental regulations and business incentives. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of such government intervention are still unknown and unclear at best. Many sceptics still think that economic growth and environmental protection are in conflict with each other and subsequently the firm’s environmental performance and export performance cannot be achieved simultaneously even with active government intervention over the firm’s environmental management. To clarify this misconception, this paper aims to examine whether government intervention leads to the affected firm’s both environmental and export performance (export sales performance). In addition, it investigates whether government intervention enhances the firm’s environmental and technological innovation capabilities and thus makes the firm more competitive in the global marketplace. In so doing, this paper verifies the ecological modernisation theory and institutional theory using the empirical analysis of the survey data obtained from the Korean manufacturing industry. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate innovation; government intervention; IP analysis; Korean manufacturing industry; structural equation modelling; sustainability","Economics; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Manufacture; Corporate innovation; Government intervention; IP analysis; Manufacturing industries; Structural equation modelling; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041814322

We develop a stylized model of online dating where agents with di erent outside options match based on how much they like each other. Starting from these microfoundations, we derive the strength and direction of indirect network effects and show that increasing the number of potential matches has a positive effect due to larger choice, but also a negative effect due to competition between agents on the same side. Agents resolve the trade-o between these competing effects di erently, depending on their outside options. For agents with high outside options, the choice effect is stronger than the competition effect, leading them to prefer an unrestricted-choice platform. The opposite is the case for agents with low outside options, who then have higher willingness to pay for a platform restricting choice, as it also restricts the choice set of their potential matches. Moreover, since only agents with low outside options self-select into the restricted choice platform, the competition effect is mitigated further. This allows multiple platforms offering di erent number of choices to coexist without the market tipping. © 2017 INFORMS.","Indirect network effects; Limits to network effects; Matching platform","Management; Operations research; Competing effects; Competition effects; Indirect network effects; Matching platform; Multiple platforms; Network effects; Two sided matching; Willingness to pay; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051401310

First, product partition model-K-means (PPM-KM) model is used to detect change points in the oil price sequence. Next, we apply a time-varying transition probability Markov regime switching (TVTP-MRS) model to identify the regime-switching characteristic. Then, we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to filtrate main determinants at each regime. Finally, the time-varying parameter structure time series model (TVP-STSM) is used to decompose the oil sequence, capture the time-variation of coefficients in “volatile upward” regime, and forecast the crude oil price. Compared with some other competing models and benchmark model of ARIMA, the newly proposed method shows superior forecasting ability in four statistical tests. Besides, we make scenario prediction on WTI crude oil price to examine the implementation effect of OPEC cut-off agreement at the end of 2016. OPEC production and U.S. shale oil production are used as two scenario variables, and the WTI price is forecasted fluctuating around 50 dollar/barrel based on three scenario prediction. We conclude that WTI crude oil price would take a shock upstream tendency in the short-term but the rising scope would not be large. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","BMA; Combination forecasting; Crude oil price; PPM; TVP-STSM; TVTP-MRS","Bayesian networks; Costs; Forecasting; Pulse position modulation; Shale oil; Bayesian model averaging; Combination forecasting; Crude oil prices; Implementation effects; Markov regime-switching; Time-varying transition; TVP-STSM; TVTP-MRS; Crude oil; Bayesian analysis; crude oil; forecasting method; numerical model; oil production; oil shale; OPEC; price determination; time series analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042278689

It typically refers to forecasts up to 12 months ahead. Traditional forecasting models take into account univariate information extrapolating from the past, but cannot anticipate macroeconomic events, such as steep increases or declines in national economic activity. In practice this is countered by using managerial expert judgement, which is well known to suffer from various biases, is expensive and not scalable. This paper evaluates multiple approaches to improve tactical sales forecasting using macro-economic leading indicators. The proposed statistical forecast selects automatically both the type of leading indicators, as well as the order of the lead for each of the selected indicators. However as the future values of the leading indicators are unknown an additional uncertainty is introduced. This uncertainty is controlled in our methodology by restricting inputs to an unconditional forecasting setup. We compare this with the conditional setup, where future indicator values are assumed to be known and assess the theoretical loss of forecast accuracy. We also evaluate purely statistical model building against judgement aided models, where potential leading indicators are pre-filtered by experts, quantifying the accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed framework improves on forecasting accuracy over established time series benchmarks, while providing useful insights about the key leading indicators. We evaluate the proposed approach on a real case study and find 18.8% accuracy gains over the current forecasting process. © 2017","Forecasting; LASSO; Leading indicators; Tactical planning; Variable selection","Economic and social effects; Economics; Sales; Scheduling; Supply chain management; Economic activities; Forecasting accuracy; LASSO; Leading indicators; Macroeconomic indicators; Statistical model buildings; Tactical planning; Variable selection; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021969734

Specifically, we estimate a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to account for the nested nature of our data (firms nested within states) and find that (1) the presence of LGBT-supportive policies is associated with higher firm value, productivity, and profitability; (2) the firm-value and profitability benefits associated with LGBT-supportive policies are larger for companies engaged in research and development (R&D) activities; and (3) the firm-value and profitability benefits of LGBT-supportive policies persist in the presence of state antidiscrimination laws. In supplemental analyses, we find that firms implementing (discontinuing) LGBT-supportive policies experience increases (decreases) in firm value, productivity, and profitability. We are among the first to link LGBT-supportive policies specifically to financial performance outcomes as well as to develop and test a multilevel model of these relationships.

Combining k-means clustering algorithm and an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (Im-NSGA-II), this paper proposes a three-phase approach to simultaneously minimize the aggregate operating cost and reduce carbon dioxide emission. To ensure the initial population's quality, the sweep algorithm is integrated as modification of the standard NSGA-II. The chromosome population consists of multiple depots and corresponding customer nodes independently assessed to find local solutions, and latterly combined to yield suboptimal routes. The nodes scan principle of the sweep algorithm is employed to enforce optimization constraints, and the non-dominated sorting of the population efficiently improves the solution search accuracy. Further, the Minimum Cost-Remaining Savings (MCRS) method is used to determine appropriate profit distribution schemes, and the selection of the optimal sequential coalition is executed on the basis of the strictly monotonic path principle. Computational comparisons on benchmark instances indicate the superiority of Im-NSGA-II over NSGA-II and MOGA, and an empirical study in Chongqing, China confirms the practicability of our solution approach.

Due to the increased use of virtual environments, it is now common for team members to examine each other's profile on a firm's enterprise social networking site (ESNS) in lieu of an initial face-to-face meeting. This study examines how the information provided in an ESNS impacts impression formation at the initial formation of a virtual team, specifically perceptions of social capital (i.e., relational, structural, and cognitive). To examine social capital perceptions, the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is utilized to understand how not only information impacts these perceptions but the way in which the user processes information to form the perceptions. Toulmin's model of argumentation is used in conjunction with ELM to understand the strength of the argument presented. Results suggest that users evaluate ESNS information differently depending on the type of processing (heuristic or systematic) and that these social capital perceptions influence preferences for different team members. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Regional economic integration not only stimulates labour mobility, but also achieve scale economy, both of which may also influence carbon dioxide (CO2) marginal abatement costs through affecting energy consumption, CO2 emissions, productivity growth, and technical progress. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has currently concerned the influence of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement costs. To fill this research gap, this study first theoretically clarifies the influence mechanism of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement cost, and then empirically attempts to investigate their relationship in the context of China, with panel data models. To serve this purpose, the provincial CO2 marginal abatement cost and regional economic integration are estimated by parametric directional distance function and price-based approach, respectively. The results show that China's regional economic integration level indeed gradually improved over 2002–2011 except in 2003–04 and 2006–09 due to the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the sub-prime loan crisis. Moreover, evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost at 5% significance level.

Using a rule formulated specifically for the French load, we compare the SARMA models with a range of different benchmark methods based on an evaluation of their point and density forecast accuracy. As sophisticated benchmarks, we employ the rule-based triple seasonal adaptations of Holt-Winters-Taylor (HWT) exponential smoothing and artificial neural networks (ANNs).

The manufacturer can sell directly by its own e-channel and indirectly via an independent reseller. Our game-theoretic model nests Arya et al. (2007) as a special case when product durability reduces to zero and thus generalizes it to the durable goods setting. The equilibrium solutions indicate that, when the product is durable, both parties’ profitability strongly depends on product durability and direct selling cost. In particular, we find that, compared to encroaching the reseller's market by direct selling online, it is optimal for the manufacturer to open an inactive e-channel that serves only as an information medium. Moreover, we find that, contrary to Arya et al.'s (2007) results, if product durability is moderate, for any direct selling cost, manufacturer's encroachment is always detrimental to the reseller, and thus its bright side disappears. We test our model's theoretical predictions of the effects of product durability on manufacturer's and reseller's profitability with data from the U.S. x86 computer server market, and find strong empirical support-profitability of both parties is higher when product durability is sufficiently low or sufficiently high, and lower when durability is intermediate. © 2017 The Author(s)","Dual channel; Durable goods; Manufacturer; Reseller; Supply chain management","Commerce; Game theory; Manufacture; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Channel structures; Dual channel; Durable goods; Equilibrium solutions; Game-theoretic model; Manufacturer; Product durability; Reseller; Durability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029177360

""What are the primary stressors in the construction workplace?"" and ""What are the relationships between the strain effect of psychological distress and the countermeasures and coping mechanisms used by construction workers?"" are, therefore, critical questions. The first question was addressed by using Q-methodology survey with 18 participants. The results showed that time, personal finance and the nature of tasks are important stressors. For the second question, a questionnaire survey administered to 91 participants on two construction sites of a single contractor was used to collect data about the stressors, psychological strain effects, and coping strategies they used. Mediated regression analysis of the data showed that lack of personal and family time, increases in the cost of living, and fears about job security all act as powerful stressors. Coping strategies including acceptance, self-blame, and disengagement are associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Increased substance use, although associated with lower levels of anxiety, may only be a short-term coping mechanism. An anomaly was found with humor as a coping strategy, in which the relationship was found to be counterintuitive and contrary to the findings of previous research. Future research should examine this more closely. Employers should better inform workers about the negative effects of maladaptive coping strategies and offer opportunities for adopting more positive alternatives. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction workers; Coping; Labor and personnel issues; Mental health; Stressors; Work-life demands","Job satisfaction; Regression analysis; Surveys; Construction workers; Coping; Mental health; Personnel issues; Stressors; Work life; Occupational risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035084232

In this study, we rely on theories of risk deterrence in decision-making and the “risky/choice shift” logic to suggest that the social identification of users regarding their community members skews the way they consider risks in decision-making on these sites.

The findings further show that the influence of these risk assessments is reduced when the degree of social identification with the website community increases; these risk considerations become negligible in decision-making processes when ’social identification is one standard deviation above the mean.

However, recent studies show that the wind farms in Texas are relatively less productive. Hence, this study aims to find out reasons of inefficiencies by constructing a two-stage performance assessment of wind farms in Texas. In the first stage of analysis, comprehensive input- and output-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models are applied to evaluate productive efficiencies of the 95 large utility-scale wind farms by using pre-determined three input and two output variables. The sensitivity analysis is provided for the robustness of the DEA models with different combinations of input and output variables of the original model. The slack analysis and projection data are obtained for inefficient wind farms to find out optimal input-output variables. Tobit regression models are conducted for the second stage of the analysis to investigate the reasons of inefficiencies. DEA results indicate that half of the wind farms were operated efficiently in Texas during 2016. 13 wind farms were performed at the most productive scale size, ten wind farms should reduce their operational size to improve production efficiency, and 72 wind farms have the notable potential to increase their production efficiency by expanding operational sizes with modern wind turbine technologies. The sensitivity analysis shows the importance of each input-output variables. Tobit regression models indicate that elevation of the site, rotor diameter, hub height, and brand of the turbine have significant contributions to the relative efficiency scores of the wind farms, and the age of turbine has a negative impact on the productive efficiency of the wind farms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Productive efficiency; Renewable energy; Texas; Tobit regression model; Wind energy","Data envelopment analysis; Electric utilities; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Wind turbines; Electricity generation sectors; Production efficiency; Productive efficiencies; Relative efficiency; Renewable energies; Texas; Tobit regression; Wind turbine technology; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051373509

Cruising also unnecessarily contributes to local congestion, vehicle emissions, air pollution, and climate change. The theoretical literature shows that these social costs can be reduced, or even eliminated, if high-quality information on the demand for and supply of parking is used to set parking prices at optimal levels. Not surprisingly, cities plagued by parking shortages, congested streets, and limited financial resources are interested in parking policies that reduce cruising and improve the efficient use of their existing parking and roadway infrastructure. The current study sheds light on the effect of the San Francisco parking pricing program (known as SFpark) on curbside parking search time and distance in urban neighborhoods on non-commuter parking. The study differs from previous empirical evaluations of similar parking pricing programs in its use of direct field measurements of parking search time and distance, rather than simulated data or proxy variables, such as parking availability. We use generalized mixed effect difference-in-difference models with data collected before and after the implementation of SFpark in both treatment and control areas to estimates effects of the San Francisco smart parking project, most importantly the demand responsive parking pricing scheme. The models control for time effects by using data from a separate control area, as opposed to using variables such as block face parking price and employment. The results suggest a significant reduction in average parking search time and distance due to SFpark. Average parking search time and distance declines by approximately 15% and 12%, respectively, from the control to the treatment areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cruising; Difference-in-difference; Parking pricing; Parking search distance; Parking search time; SFpark","Air pollution; Climate change; Traffic congestion; Cruising; Difference-in-differences; Empirical evaluations; Financial resources; High quality information; Roadway infrastructure; Search time; SFpark; Costs; neighborhood; numerical model; parking; road pricing; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic congestion; California; San Francisco [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044127479

When the performances of alternatives on each attribute are expressed by distributions instead of single values, how to use the differences among the performances to obtain attribute weights is an interesting but difficult issue. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a method for obtaining attribute weights from discriminating power in belief distributions. With the consideration of the differences among the utilities of all assessment grades used to profile belief distributions, the dissimilarity based discriminating power, the standard deviation based discriminating power and the Gini's mean difference based discriminating power of the performances of all alternatives on each attribute are constructed to determine three sets of respective weights of attributes. They are convexly combined using three coefficients to generate integrated weights of attributes. To relieve the burden on a decision maker to provide precise values for the three coefficients, they are allowed to change between 0 and 1, as long as their sum is equal to 1. Under such constraints on the three coefficients, an optimization model is constructed to determine the minimum and maximum expected utilities of each alternative. From the expected utilities, all alternatives are then compared using Hurwicz rule with the provided optimism degree interval to generate solutions to MADA problems. The transitivity of the comparison outcomes among three alternatives under a given optimism degree interval is theoretically analyzed to guarantee the rationality of the outcomes. A focal form selection problem is investigated to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed method. © 2017","Analytical algorithm; Attribute weights; Belief distributions; Multiple attribute decision analysis; Transitivity","Decision making; Optimization; Analytical algorithms; Attribute weight; Belief distributions; Multiple attribute decision analysis; Transitivity; Decision theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038632669

This paper studies an EV battery closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a battery manufacturer and a remanufacturer. The manufacturer produces new batteries by using natural resources, while the remanufacturer collects returned batteries and makes decisions based on the return quality, that is, to reuse or recycle. The purpose of this paper is to maximise the individual profits through optimising the amount of manufacturing and remanufacturing, respectively, and optimising the purchase price of returned batteries. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the Nash equilibrium, this paper develops a three-period model in the CLSC. In period 1, batteries are made from raw materials; in period 2, returned batteries from period 1 are sorted into low quality and high quality. Some high-quality returns can be reused for other purposes while those non-reusable returns are recycled into materials. In period 3, all the returns are recycled into materials. The analytical results are derived. Findings – The result of the analyses suggest that first, among the variables that affect the (re-) manufacturing decision, the purchase price for returned batteries plays a critical role. In particular, the price of low-quality returns has more influence than the price of high quality returns. Second, the higher purchase price for re-usable returns does not necessarily lead to a higher return rate of reusable returns. Third, the manufacturer’s profit is normally higher than the remanufacturer’s. This suggests the need to design incentives to promote the remanufacturing sector. And finaly, although it is appreciated that maximising the utilisation of batteries over the life-cycle would benefit the environment, the economic benefit needs further investigation. Originality/value – Although the CLSC has been widely studied, studies on the EV battery CLSC are scarce. The EV battery CLSC is particularly challenging in terms of the reusability of returns because used EV batteries cannot be reused for the original purpose, which complicates CLSC operations. This paper explores the interrelationship between manufacturer and remanufacturer, explaining the reasons why recycling is still underdeveloped, and suggests the possibility of enhancing remanufacturing profitability. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Closed-loop supply chain; Electric vehicle battery; Profit; Purchasing price; Recycle; Reuse","Automobile manufacture; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Life cycle; Linear matrix inequalities; Manufacture; Profitability; Recycling; Reusability; Sales; Supply chains; Vehicles; Analytical results; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Design/methodology/approach; Economic benefits; Electric vehicle batteries; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Reuse; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041138579

However, there was no empirical evidence on the moderating role of CEO narcissism, a common CEO characteristic in many cases, on the national culture-CSR relationship.

However, evidence on the relationship between EHR adoption and costs is mixed, leading to skepticism about the e ectiveness of EHR in decreasing costs. We argue that simply looking at the hospital-level e ects can be misleading because the benefits of EHR can go beyond the adopting hospital by creating regional spillovers via information and patient sharing. When patients move between hospitals, timely and high-quality records received at one hospital can a ect the costs of care at another hospital. We provide evidence that although EHR adoption increases the costs of the adopting hospital, it has significant spillover e ects by reducing the costs of neighboring hospitals. We further show that these spillovers are linked to information and patient sharing. Specifically, the spillovers are stronger when more hospitals in the region are in health information exchange networks and in the same integrated delivery systems, which can share information more easily. Furthermore, utilizing regional characteristics that can a ect the extent of patient sharing such as urban versus rural areas, population density, average distance between hospitals, and hospital density, we find that locations with higher patient and hospital concentration experience stronger regional spillovers. Additionally, spillovers are stronger after the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act that increased EHR adoption and use. Overall, our findings suggest that we need to take into account externalities to understand the benefits of health IT investments and form policy decisions. © 2017 INFORMS.","Electronic health records; Health IT; IT productivity; IT spillovers; Network externality","Cost reduction; Economics; Health care; Information dissemination; Investments; Population statistics; Records management; Electronic health record; Health it; IT productivity; IT spillovers; Network externality; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048098339

To understand whether and how strategy-makers can construct a steady influx of captivating narratives of transformative change, we analyzed how one noted strategy-maker assisted the successful transformation of his organization over three decades by orchestrating the production of change narratives. Our analysis reveals that the strategy-maker constructed and reconstructed meanings of change over time using three sets of distinct but interconnected narrative practices. We develop a dynamic model linking the simultaneous mobilization of these practices to strategy-makers’ ability to harness the persistent tension between novelty and familiarity in a transformative change, and thereby, win endorsement from key audiences. Managerial Summary: How can storytelling be used to influence acceptance of an ongoing organizational transformation? In this article, we try to answer this question by examining how, over three decades, Italian company Alessi documented its transformation from a manufacturer of kitchen steel utensils to a producer of a variety of household objects purchased also for their symbolic value. The leader behind Alessi's transformation, Alberto Alessi, orchestrated such storytelling effort, targeting employees, customers, retailers, and visitors to Alessi exhibitions. Our findings uncover how stories can be used to win audiences’ endorsement of change through narrative practices aimed at: (a) constructing a collective memory of change, (b) depicting change as a novel but coherent departure from the past, and (c) portraying change as a transcendent endeavor.

The coal mine output has continued to increase, and the production capacity is expanding at an unprecedented rate. However, this level of the output had been accompanied by poor geological mining conditions, low efficiency, high pollution, and high fatality rates. Thus, in order to have healthy development in the future, it is necessary to establish a safe, efficient, and sustainable coal industry in China. This paper examines four key conceptual dimensions for relative technological innovation of China's coal mine: research and development, resource exploitation, organizational management, and financial management. We established groups of indicators reflecting the performance of coal mine's technological innovation activities in each dimension. After reviewing major approaches to increase capacity for innovation, we developed an index system based on Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA) to audit the progress of innovation and development. We performed a case study of twenty certified green coal mines, the result demonstrates that this index system and model can effectively evaluate coal mine's relative technological innovation capability and get the input gap towards safety, efficiency and sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Coal mine; Data envelopment analysis; Technological innovation","Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Research and development management; Fatality rates; Financial managements; Mining conditions; Organizational management; Production capacity; Research and development; Technological innovation; Technological innovation capability; Coal mines; coal industry; coal mine; data envelopment analysis; exploitation; finance; industrial performance; innovation; management practice; research and development; technology adoption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046357950

Moreover, prior studies have not yet integrated and proposed a complex interrelationship-driven hierarchical model including qualitative preferences or identifying weighting under linguistic preferences. This study applied the fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy importance performance analysis and an analytical network process to analyze an interrelationship-driven hierarchical model of service innovation in sustainable product service systems. Hence, this study provides a set of attributes and a hybrid method to assess the model as well as linguistic preferences to weight the importance and performance measures. The results present four features that are included in the model: sustainable consumption, collaborative advantage, innovation activities and service innovation capabilities.

One of the most outstanding global problems facing Africa is the digital divide. However, the use and adoption of mobile phones is reducing the digital divide in Africa. In view of the role that mobile phones play in bridging the digital divide in Africa, this study extends the applicability of the technology acceptance model (TAM), without altering its parsimony and information technology focus, in mobile phone adoption. This paper extends the TAM model by adding two new constructs, perceived advantage and socio-economic characteristics. Consequently, the extended TAM was applied to adoption of mobile phones in farming communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study relies on a sample from 300 dairy farmers in Uganda which was analysed using structural equation modelling. Theoretically, it contributes to the limited literature on mobile phone adoption in agri-food sector in Sub-Saharan Africa and provides empirical evidence from Ugandan farmers. The research contributes to promoting mobile phone usage in farming communities beyond just normal communication.

A central question surrounding the introduction of online collaborative consumption regards its impact on incumbent firms. For example, ride-hailing services could discourage private car ownership, potentially leading to a subsequent decline of new car sales. Our study investigates whether the adoption of a leading ride-hailing platform, Didi Chuxing, increases or decreases new car sales shortly after the platform's entries across 51 cities in China. Our empirical results suggest that the initial entry of a dominant ride-hailing company like Didi Chuxing positively impacts new car sales in the short run.

We first establish that megaproject planning is carried on by polycentric organizations. We show that in this form of organizing the promoter has decision-making authority over the high-order choices, but shares the authority over the local choices with groups of autonomous stakeholders. We also show how this organizational architecture addresses local disputes and pressures to relax performance targets. Our main contribution is a contingency model that proposes four conditions linking performance to polycentric organizing, whether or not: i) the institutional environment empowers an ‘umpire’ to referee disputes; and ii) the system leader can mobilize substantial slack resources to reconcile conflicting interests.

These technologies differ in cost and efficiency: for example, collection by apheresis requires very expensive machines but the yield of blood products is considerably greater than whole blood collection. Blood centre managers are faced with the difficult strategic problem of choosing the best combination of technologies, as well as the equally difficult operational problem of assigning donors to collection methods. These decisions are complex since so many factors have to be taken into account, including stochastic demand, blood group compatibilities, donor availability, the proportions of blood types in both donor and recipient populations, fixed and variable costs, and process efficiencies. The use of deterministic demand forecasts is rarely adequate and a robust decision must consider uncertainty and variability in demand as well as trade-offs between several potentially conflicting objectives. This paper presents a multi-objective stochastic integer linear programming model to support such decisions. The model treats demand as stochastic and seeks to optimize two objectives: the total cost and the number of donors required.

To explore the complex supplier-customer interplay, we introduce the concept of buyer-supplier flexibility fit (i.e., the match between the level of flexibility the customer expects from its supplier and the supplier's level of flexibility) and explore its impact on the supplier's financial performance (i.e., ROA). We collected dyadic archival and survey data from 638 firms (319 supplier-customer dyads) to test these relationships. Our results indicate that buyer-supplier flexibility fit has a direct and positive impact on the supplier's ROA. Further, the strength of the relationship increases when firms operate in munificent and/or dynamic environments but does not change significantly in complex environments. The relationship also becomes stronger as the exchanged business volume increases between the customer and its supplier, and as the relationship progresses in age. In addition, our findings indicate that firms with perfect buyer-supplier flexibility fit perform best, followed by firms with negative misfit (i.e., the supplier's level of flexibility is lower than its customer's expected level of flexibility), while firms with positive misfit (i.e., the supplier's level of flexibility is higher than its customer's expected level of flexibility) are the laggards. Interestingly, positive misfit has a stronger negative impact on suppliers’ ROA compared to misfit in general and negative misfit. Key corresponding managerial implications are derived. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Buyer-supplier flexibility fit; Complexity; Dynamism; Firm performance; Munificence","Commerce; Buyer-supplier flexibility fit; Complexity; Dynamism; Firm Performance; Munificence; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047261779

Most of the ideas proposed to this point involve either behavioral nudges or administrative regulations that are either too paternalistic or piecemeal to represent viable solutions. In this study, we investigate the potential for commercial peer-to-peer mutualization systems (CPMSs), or sharing-economy firms, to emerge as market platforms for the exchange of surplus food. If a system of CPMSs is able to develop in a self-sustaining way, then the market prices they create will generate sufficient incentives for all actors to manage surplus food more efficiently. We develop an empirical model of a CPMS operating as a platform in a two-sided market, and examine its viability using data from one of the first CPMS firms in the surplus-harvest industry, Imperfect Produce, Inc. Empirical estimates of a two-sided network-demand model show that user-demand rises in the number of growers shipping to the platform, and grower demand for distribution rises in the number of users. Our findings indicate that secondary markets have the key elements needed for CPMS success, and that policy tools designed to facilitate transactions in secondary markets can be highly effective in reducing food waste. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"environmental economics; food market; food security; food waste; incentive; numerical model; policy implementation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044633031

A conceptual model was developed and tested using data collected from 197 Malaysian manufacturing firms for the study. Data set was examined and hypotheses were tested by employing Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis. The results revealed that internal operations, postponement, strategic supplier partnership, and guanxi have positive and significant relationships with TI; while guanxi mediates the relationships between four SCM practices (i.e. strategic supplier partnership, information quality, postponement, and internal operations) with TI. Findings show that through proper implementation of SCM practices, firms are able to achieve better TI performance. These findings are useful for decision-makers when formulating SCM strategies and focusing on practices that will help them achieve greater TI. This paper also contributes to existing operations management research by empirically validating guanxi as the mediator between SCM practices and TI. From a developing nation perspective, this paper identifies the important relationships that exist between SCM, guanxi and TI.

Research has thus far offered only limited theoretical guidance while practical applications often lack a systematic approach. The realization of sustainability goals is impeded by disconnects between supply chain vision, strategy, and execution. This research bridges this gap and offers guidance through the identification and description of influential factors and decision models. An exploratory Delphi study involved supply chain and sustainability experts with the goal to explore and propose factors and decision processes for sustainable supply chain management. This study builds upon the insights offered by seminal models and leverages the Delphi mechanisms of exploration and controlled feedback in order to design, refine, and validate decision models through three consecutive rounds. This Delphi facilitated the identification and assessment of vital relationships and influential factors for sustainable supply chain management. The study culminates in the design and validation of models specifically targeted at the transformation and on-going maturity development of sustainable supply chains. The combination of research outcomes provides targeted decision support to supply chain managers which is desperately needed in order to drive sustainability development and implementation. The main contributions of the study thus are (1) the design of prescriptive artefacts that describe relationships in SSCM, (2) to offer targeted and evaluated decision support functionalities for sustainable supply chains, and (3) to provide fertile ground for future research enquiries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Decision models; Delphi; Maturity; Supply chains; Sustainability; Transformation","Air navigation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Corporate-sustainability; Decision models; Decision supports; Delphi; Influential factors; Maturity; Sustainable supply chains; Transformation; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050356436

We investigate the sustainability reporting, focusing on stakeholder-related practices disclosed by the 50 largest hotel groups worldwide, by testing the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard. We use the three interrelated dimensions (inclusiveness, materiality and responsiveness) to assess the disclosure of how organisations (1) identify and engage with stakeholders, (2) determine the importance of sustainability issues, and (3) respond to stakeholder concerns. We find the low transparency and imprecision of decision-making criteria and processes suggest sustainability reporting is more of a legitimisation exercise than one of accountability. We find the stakeholder identification approach does not inform the organisation's transparency, whereas the dialogue mechanisms used to empower stakeholders, as their participatory role in decision-making and the reporting process, shape the disclosure of materiality and responsiveness. We demonstrate how that the ability to determine stakeholder engagement, materiality analysis and responsiveness of the sustainability reporting process can improve the role of sustainability reports as a mechanism for accountability, and we argue the importance of the alignment between the degree of disclosure on inclusiveness, materiality and responsiveness. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","accountability; hospitality industry; materiality analysis; stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder theory; sustainability reporting","accountability; decision making; hospitality industry; hotel industry; stakeholder; sustainability; theoretical study; tourism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038108526

The reviews from e-commerce websites are usually attached to ratings, which facilitates learning from the reviews by users. However, many reviews that spread across forums or social media are written in plain text, which is not rated, and these reviews are called non-rated reviews in this paper. From the perspective of sentiment analysis at the aspects level, this study develops a predictive framework for calculating ratings for non-rated reviews. The idea behind the framework began with an observation: the sentiment of an aspect is determined by its context; the rating of the review depends on the sentiment of the aspects and the number of positive and negative aspects in the review. Viewing term pairs that co-occur with aspects as their context, we conceived of a variant of a Conditional Random Field model, called SentiCRF, for generating term pairs and calculating their sentiment scores from a training set. Then, we developed a cumulative logit model that uses aspects and their sentiments in a review to predict the ratings of the review. In addition, we met the challenge of class imbalance when calculating the sentiment scores of term pairs. We also conceived of a heuristic re-sampling algorithm to tackle class imbalance. Experiments were conducted on the Yelp dataset, and their results demonstrate that the predictive framework is feasible and effective at predicting the ratings of reviews. © 2018","Business Intelligence; Class imbalance; Ratings of reviews; Sentiment analysis","Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Forecasting; Personnel training; Business decisions; Class imbalance; Conditional random field; E-commerce websites; Logit modeling; Online reviews; Sentiment scores; Training sets; Sentiment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045535287

Thus, this paper offers an innovative approach to integrating models from the disciplines of psychology and advertising. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Attention–Interest–Desire–Actions model; decision-making process; integrative model; Model of Goal-directed Behavior; pop culture tourism","conceptual framework; cultural influence; decision making; numerical model; tourist behavior; tourist destination; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042908153

We consider these related objectives in designing efficient and sustainable supply networks using a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model for efficient and sustainable supplier selection and order allocation with stochastic demand. Our approach considers sustainability dimensions including economic, environmental and social responsibility, but also seeks to design the most efficient supply network given constraints of the supply market. Enterprise efficiency is assessed using a bi-objective data envelopment analysis (DEA) whose inputs include raw materials, current expenses and labour force capacity. The resulting model is non-convex because of the presence of bilinear terms in DEA-related constraints, so we introduce a multi-stage solution procedure that first uses piecewise McCormick envelopes (PCM) to linearise the bilinear terms. Next, we introduce a set of valid inequalities in order to improve solution time of the problem whose dimension significantly increases after being linearised. We then exploit chance constrained programming approaches to deal with stochastic demand. Finally, a single aggregated objective function is derived using a fuzzy multi-objective programming approach. A manufacturing case study demonstrates the validity of the proposed approach, and its effectiveness in designing a supply network that addresses the ‘triple bottom line’ of people, profit and planet that comprises many sustainability initiatives in an efficient manner. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chance-constrained programming; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Non-linear programming; Order allocation; Supplier selection; Valid inequalities","Budget control; Computer programming; Data envelopment analysis; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Chance-constrained programming; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Multiobjective programming; Order allocation; Supplier selection; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable supplier selections; Valid inequality; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060430985

(2) How do improvements in marketing and finance skills respectively affect different business outcomes? (3) When are increases in marketing relative to finance skills more beneficial? Through a randomized control study of 852 firms in South Africa, the analysis finds significant improvements in profitability from both types of business skills training. However, the pathways to achieve these gains differ substantially between the two groups. The marketing group achieves greater profits by adopting a growth focus on higher sales, greater investments in stock and materials, and hiring more employees. The finance group achieves similar profit gains but through an efficiency focus on lower costs. Both groups showsignificantly higher adoption of business practices related to their respective training program. Consistent with a growth focus, marketing/sales skills are significantly more beneficial to businesses run by entrepreneurs with ex ante less exposure to different market contexts. In contrast and in line with an efficiency focus, it is the more established businesses that benefit significantly more from finance/accounting skills. © 2018 INFORMS.","Business training; Effectiveness-performance; Emerging markets; Finance; Growth strategies; Marketing; Organizational studies; Randomized control trial","Commerce; Efficiency; Finance; Marketing; Personnel training; Profitability; Business training; Effectiveness-performance; Emerging markets; Growth strategy; Organizational studies; Randomized control trials; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055185118

However, product deletion or discontinuation is also critical. Despite its strategic importance, product deletion has received relatively less attention in both academia and practice. Researchers have conceptually investigated product deletion, its influence on firm's resources, the factors influencing product deletion decisions, and the product deletion process. However, very few papers have related product deletion decisions to supply chain management, especially when leanness and sustainability are major objectives. This paper aims to integrate lean and sustainable supply chain dimensions with product deletion by proposing a multilevel decision model that can facilitate a product deletion decision with an objective of developing a leaner and more sustainable supply chain. The model has three major decision dimensions with 8 factors with 29 influencing determinants. The model uses an integrated analytical hierarchy/network process (AHP/ANP) and a benefits, opportunities, cost and risks (BOCR) analysis. An illustrative company scenario is provided for the model application. The paper contributes by filling an important gap by integrating lean and sustainable supply chain management and product deletion literature to formulate a product deletion decision making model which aids in enhancing the leanness and sustainability of supply chains. The model also allows for cross-functional participation involving marketing, operations, finance, and environmental sustainability fields. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Analytical hierarchy/network process model; BOCR analysis; Lean supply chain; Product deletion; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Decision making; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Analytical hierarchies; BOCR analysis; Decision making models; Environmental sustainability; Lean supply chains; Process Modeling; Product deletion; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054859479

Our paper seeks to advance the knowledge on supply chain organizational learning by showing that four distinct supply chain learning orientations (team, learning, memory, and systems), previously studied only as a collective, can be parsed strategically. We parse these four learning orientations into creation capacity (team and learning orientations) and dispersion capacity (memory and system orientations). The creation and dispersion capacity can enhance exploration (long-term) and exploitation (short-term) practices respectively in supply chain organizations. We used a survey questionnaire to collect data from 128 respondents belonging to firms of various sizes and different industries. We find that creation capacity is positively associated with exploration and indirectly associated with exploitation through exploration. Dispersion capacity is associated with exploitation and indirectly influences market share and profitability through exploitation. The findings demonstrate that creation and dispersion-based combinations of supply chain learning orientations coalesce to influence exploration and exploitation practices.

In this study, the model was applied to quantify the effects of drought on the Swedish irrigation sector in 2013, a typical drought year, for a specific crop. The results show that drought can severely affect the crop yield if irrigation is not applied, with a peak yield reduction of 18 t/ha, about 50 % loss as compared to the potential yield in irrigated conditions. Accordingly, the water and energy requirements for irrigation to halt the negative drought effects and maintain high yields are significant, with the peaks up to 350 mm and 700 kWh per hectare. The developed model can be used to provide near real-time guidelines for a comprehensive drought management system.

Using a panel dataset of 280 Chinese prefectural cities from 2003 to 2012, we employ a spatial economic approach. Although limited to evidence from soot and SO 2 pollutants, our results suggest that FDI brings overall positive environmental knowledge externalities to a region, and also spillovers to nearby regions. Specialised cities may lock into a particular technological path, attenuating the absorption and diffusion of a variety of FDI environmental knowledge. Conversely, diversified cities promote cross-fertilisation of environmental knowledge and mitigate local pollution intensity at the aggregated city level.

Using a comprehensive longitudinal data set on deal offerings and sales across local markets, and combining it with local market characteristics, we estimate a simultaneous equation model of the weekly number of deal offerings and deal sales characterizing the two-sided nature of the platform. We find that the word-of-mouth effect on the consumer side and the observational learning effect on the merchant side contribute to and reinforce the expansion of a two-sided platform. However, a larger number of deals intensifies the competition, which then lowers per deal sales and limits the number of deal offerings.

Using Xiamen City as a case study, the future GHG emissions trends from 2015 to 2050 was simulated under three scenarios, namely a business-as-usual scenario (BAU), an emission-controlled scenario (EC), and a reinforced mitigation scenario (RM). Results show that Xiamen City will peak its total GHG emissions in 2039 under EC scenario and 2034 under RM scenario, while there might not be an obvious GHG peak under BAU scenario before 2050. Total CO2 emissions will peak at the same year as the GHG emissions peak year under EC and RM scenarios. Our research also indicates that population and economic growth has a significant impact on the city's CO2 and GHG peak, and Xiamen might reach the CO2 peak later than the national goal due to clean energy supply limitations and continued rapid growth. Lack of favorable conditions for large-scale renewable energy development and relatively high price of natural gas are the main obstacles for CO2 and GHG reduction in Xiamen City. In the future, greater attention on multi-sector reduction strategies is needed, including transforming industrial structure, expanding public transport while limiting private car growth, controlling per capita residential living area, improving public building energy efficiency, and reducing and reusing waste. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Co-benefits; CO2 peak; LEAP; Scenario analysis; Urban GHG emissions","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy efficiency; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Co benefits; CO2 peak; GHG emission; LEAP; Scenario analysis; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034023581

We argue that firms with non-market capabilities are insensitive to supranational institutional safeguards when choosing the location of their international investments. We show that supranational agreements between an investor's home and host nation, operationalized as bilateral investment treaties (BITs), increase the likelihood of investment, but there is substantial firm heterogeneity with respect to this relationship. Firms with various forms of non-market capabilities are not sensitive to BITs, whereas other firms are more likely to invest under BITs. We advance the understanding of how firm non-market capabilities can substitute for supranational institutional arrangements in addressing risks associated with host country institutional weaknesses. Managerial Summary: The risk of expropriation is one of the main concerns companies have when investing abroad. Because of this, many countries implement bilateral investment treaties (BITs) to safeguard foreign investments, alleviate foreign investor concerns, and promote investments. We show that only those companies without political competence or political connections favor countries with BITs when choosing where to invest. Companies with political competence or political connections, on the other hand, ignore BITs and apparently rely on their ability to influence governments whenever their foreign investments face expropriation threats. As a result, politically connected or competent companies can enter markets most of their competitors lacking these capabilities shy away from. They can, therefore, do business in environments in which they face less competition. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bilateral investment treaties (BITs); international investment location choice; non-market capabilities; political connections; supranational institutions","Commerce; Competition; Location; bilateral investment treaties (BITs); Firm heterogeneity; Foreign investment; Institutional arrangement; International investments; Location choice; non-market capabilities; Political Connections; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052391556

However, much attention has been paid to transformational leadership style, whereas studies on transactional leadership style are not available. To this end, this paper explores the relationship between the two leadership styles and innovation atmosphere in enterprises. The intermediary role that trust and individual identification play in the relationship between leadership style and innovation atmosphere is examined as well. We conduct a survey on 294 respondents and run hierarchical regression and adjustment regression. The results show that (1) transformational leadership style can facilitate to build trust and individual identification; (2) transformational leadership style is more helpful for building innovation atmosphere; (3) it is easier for leaders with transformational leadership style to build trust and that trust positively affects innovation atmosphere; (4) trust and individual identity are helpful for creating innovation atmosphere; (5) trust and individual identification play an intermediary role between transformational leadership style and innovation atmosphere; (6) trust does not play an intermediary role between transactional leadership style and innovation atmosphere, whereas individual identity does.

The proposed Cluster Stations and Regress (CSR) modeling approach involves first clustering PBS stations based on the types of trips they attract using k-means or fuzzy c-means clustering techniques. After obtaining station-cluster membership values for each station, we estimate multilevel mixed-effect regression models with interactions between the station-cluster membership variables and determinants of PBS station usage. Determinants considered in the empirical models include the socio-demographic and commute characteristics of the residents in each PBS station's census tract, weather variables, temporal variables, and PBS station proximity to restaurants, jobs, transit stops, rail stations, the CBD, bicycle infrastructure, and other PBS stations. The model results clearly indicate that determinants of PBS station usage vary across station-clusters and including station-cluster interaction terms significantly improves model fit. Additionally, the results of cross-validation tests indicate that the CSR approach is a promising method to model monthly PBS station usage. The empirical results also clear up conflicting findings in the literature in terms of the impact of nearby PBS stations on station usage. We find that station usage increases with the number of other PBS stations within 1–5 km for member trips. However, after controlling for this effect, station usage decreases as the number of other PBS stations within 0.8 km increases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bikesharing; Clustering; Demand modeling; Multilevel mixed models; Shared mobility","Regression analysis; Bicycle infrastructures; Bikesharing; Cluster interactions; Clustering; Cross-validation tests; Demand modeling; Fuzzy C means clustering; Multilevel mixed model; K-means clustering; cluster analysis; empirical analysis; numerical model; public transport; regression analysis; transportation mode; travel demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038376245

But in most realistic settings, only partial distribution information is available or reliably estimated. The distributionally robust newsvendor model is often used in this case where the worst-case expected profit is maximized over the set of distributions satisfying the known information, which is usually the mean and covariance of demands. However, covariance does not capture information on asymmetry of the demand distribution. In this paper, we introduce a measure of distribution asymmetry using second-order partitioned statistics. Semivariance is a special case with a single partition of the univariate demand. With mean, variance, and semivariance information, we show that a three-point distribution achieves the worst-case expected profit and derive a closed-form expression for the distributionally robust order quantity. For multivariate demand, the distributionally robust problem with partitioned statistics is hard to solve, butwe develop a computationally tractable lower bound through the solution of a semidefinite program. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that asymmetry information significantly reduces expected profit loss particularly when the true distribution is heavy tailed. In computational experiments on automotive spare parts demand data, we provide evidence that the distributionally robust model that includes partitioned statistics outperforms the model that uses only covariance information. © 2017 INFORMS.","Approximations; Heuristics; Inventory production; Nonlinear theory; Programming; Stochastic models; Uncertainty","Computation theory; Mathematical programming; Probability distributions; Profitability; Stochastic systems; Approximations; Heuristics; Inventory productions; Non-linear theory; Uncertainty; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042714742

The optimum use of agricultural input resources results in the increase of efficiency and the decrease of the carbon footprint of turnip production. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is a well-known technique utilized to evaluate the efficiency for peer units compared with the best practice frontier, widely used by researches to analyze the performance of agricultural sector. In this regard, a new non-radial DEA-based efficiency model is designed to investigate the efficiency of turnip farms. For this purpose, five inputs and two outputs are considered. The outputs consist turnip yield as a desirable output and greenhouse gas emission as an undesirable output. The new model projects each DMU on the strong efficient frontier. Several important properties are stated and proved which show the capabilities of our proposed model. The new models are applied in evaluating 30 turnip farms in Fars, Iran. This case study demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed models. The target inputs and outputs for these farms are also calculated and the benchmark farm for each DMU is determined. Finally, the reduction of CO2 emission for each turnip farm is evaluated. Compared with other factors like human labor, diesel fuel, seed and fertilizers, one of the most important findings is that machinery has the highest contribution to the total target energy saving. Besides, the average target emission of turnip production in the region is 7% less than the current emission. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Energy saving; Undesirable output","Agriculture; Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Data envelopment analysis; Diesel fuels; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Machinery; Agricultural sector; Current emissions; Data envelopment analysis models; Desirable outputs; Efficiency models; Production methods; Strong efficient frontiers; Undesirable output; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047496973

Also, overlooking the more macro factors like project governance and supply chain management, LC deployments have been mainly discussed from a production process perspective to date. After a review of the extant literature and 20 interviews with managers from the highways sector, a list of 31 current condition and 40 future direction statements were produced, classified under the delivery, process, training, project governance and supply chain related headings and used in a questionnaire survey with 110 responses. The current condition highlights problems like a short-term relations structure, competitive tendering mechanisms, fragmentation, problems in engaging with SMEs for LC, unstandardised LC techniques, and issues with convincing SMEs to deploy LC by demonstrating the business case on mutual benefits.

The authors seek to open a discussion on new value creation through social manufacturing, specifically facilitated by do-it-yourself (DIY), do-it-together (DIT) and participatory design strategies. Social manufacturing can be seen as a more open and democratic approach to manufacturing, prompting different levels of user participation in the production process. The authors will illustrate how these alternative design strategies, build within the context of social manufacturing, can offer system-level changes by activating and empowering the end user to become value creators, while forming new, more sustainable innovations in design and manufacturing of fashion. The specific questions asked in this paper are: What types of value are created in social manufacturing through opening the design and manufacturing processes with alternative design strategies? Further, can social manufacturing enable sustainable solutions by transitioning the users to manufacturers of their own garments, prompting a new value system and range of business models in the fashion industry? An alternative value framework, developed within this paper, will enable the analysis of empirical data collected in Finland and the U.S. In the discussion, the authors demonstrate strategies to create wider change in the fashion system through social manufacturing, starting at a local level through empowered consumers. © 2017","Do-it-together; Do-it-yourself; Fashion; Participatory design; Social manufacturing; Sustainable business models; Value; Value creation","Education; Environmental protection; Networks (circuits); Planning; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Websites; Communication formats; Education for sustainable development; Educational policy; Higher education institutions; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Professional development; Social capitals; Sustainability transition; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038835806

Given the open and dynamic internet environment, which lacks a central control of individual service providers, we propose in this paper a novel method that seamlessly considers Quality of Service (QoS) and credibility of service providers to achieve optimal service compositions. Instead of using creditability as one of the QoS attributes, we treat it as the overall capability of a service provider to deliver its promised QoS. We aggregate both user experience (i.e., user trust) and track record (i.e., service reputation) of a provider for accurate creditability evaluation. To facilitate user decision making when multiple (and sometimes conflicting) QoS attributes are involved, we develop an automatic weight calculation approach based on rough set theory and a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, which assigns higher weights to the more discriminative attributes. Finally, to achieve an optimal service composition, a two phase optimization process is employed, where local optimization chooses services based on creditable QoS assessment and global optimization tackles a multi-objective problem using an effective cuckoo search algorithm. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed QoS-aware service composition approach achieves desirable QoS with credibility guarantees. The performance of our proposed approach also significantly outperforms other competitive methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Credibility evaluation; Multi-objective optimization; QoS; Web service composition","Computation theory; Decision making; Decision theory; Global optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Quality control; Rough set theory; Web services; Websites; Credibility evaluation; Cuckoo search algorithms; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Internet environment; Multi-objective problem; QoS-aware service compositions; Two-phase optimizations; Web service composition; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035031201

Each firm will negotiate and develop its own set of relationships with other innovation system actors based on its capabilities and strategies. To better understand these dynamics, particularly from the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises, this study probes the micro-level characteristics and impacts of external enterprise relationships. Novel website-based Triple Helix measures are introduced that extend the analytical scope beyond customary indicators (such as patent analysis or entropy measures) to include communication and coordination among all three helices at the micro-level of individual firms. This approach is used to explore the micro-level characteristics and impacts of industry, government and university relations for small and medium-sized enterprises by analyzing a subset of 271 U.S. green goods small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. We compare the website-based measures with case study results to authenticate the method. A panel data regression model is then employed to analyze the simultaneous impacts of various combinations of industry, government and university links on firm sales growth (2008–2011), with controls for region, scale, and application domains. The ability of website-based indicators to distinguish the impacts of different mixes of Triple Helix relations is demonstrated. While relationships with all three helices have a positive total marginal effect on firm sales growth, local relationships and relationships that emphasize links with government and industry make particularly notable contributions to growth in the sample green goods enterprises. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2016 The Authors","Growth; Micro-level relationships; Small and medium enterprises; SME; Triple Helix; Website data","Data mining; Growth (materials); Patents and inventions; Public policy; Regression analysis; Sales; Websites; Innovation system; Marginal effects; Micro level; Small and medium enterprise; Small and medium sized enterprise; Small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprise; Triple helixes; University collaborations; Green manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058140672

Decisions to be made in advance are which stands to cut and which new access roads to build in each period, while maximizing profit under manageable risk. We first developed a tighter, improved formulation of our earlier deterministic mixed 0–1 model (see Andalaft et al. (2003)), and its stochastic counterpart for a set of representative scenarios, an extension of our simplified risk-neutral version (see Alonso-Ayuso, Escudero, Guignard, Quinteros, and Weintraub (2011)). Using the expected value of the stochastic parameters might produce poor or even infeasible solutions if some extreme scenarios are realized. A stochastic model, however, enables the planner to make more robust decisions. In particular, being able to control risk in early periods is important, as firms tend to emphasize short term financial results. We tested two risk measures that extend the classical Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) by controlling the risk at a subset of intermediate periods (time-inconsistent TCVaR) or at a subset of scenario groups (time-consistent ECVaR), with time consistency as given in Homem-de Mello and Pagnoncelli (2016) and others. We also combined TCVaR and ECVaR into what we call MCVaR. We analyzed the planned and implementable policies of all above risk measures in a broad computational experiment, on a large size realistic instance. The results show that ECVaR, TCVaR and MCVaR outperform the classical CVaR approach. MCVAR usually provides better solutions for the first periods with overall profit distribution similar to the other measures for the planned policy, TCVaR gives the highest profit results for the implementable policy, while ECVaR gives the highest profit at the end of the time horizon in both policies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Consistency in risk-averse measures; Forestry planning; Optimization under uncertainty; OR in natural resources; Risk management","Forestry; Natural resources management; Profitability; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Timber; Value engineering; Computational experiment; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Forestry planning; Optimization under uncertainty; OR in natural resources; Profit distributions; Risk averse; Stochastic parameters; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040100387

While CE can be an important policy tool to promote more sustainable development trajectories, in practice it does not always avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services caused by resource extraction and infrastructure development. Here we review the current status of biodiversity protection and CE policy in China, highlighting some of their challenges. We then explore the prospects for market-based biodiversity offsets to address the current shortcomings in existing CE policy. Finally, we propose a conceptual model that incorporates a commitment to no-net-loss mitigation into the overall CE strategy to expand the use of biodiversity offsets in China and to remove some of the deficiencies by involving private enterprises in conservation efforts. This model can be used to analyze a set of parameters for comparing different offsets against one another. We propose that such an integrative framework can help CE policy achieve the intended goal of decoupling economic growth from impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in China. Important next steps are the implementation of case studies for target industries and ecosystems to demonstrate the synergy between CE and biodiversity offsets and evaluate on-the-ground effectiveness of the proposed integration by adapting our framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Economic growth; Mitigation banking; Payment for ecosystem services; Sustainable development","Biodiversity; Climate change; Economics; Environmental protection; Extraction; Planning; Raw materials; Sustainable development; Biodiversity protection; Economic growths; Ecosystem services; Infrastructure development; Integrative framework; Mitigation banking; Raw material extraction; Resource extraction; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046035280

However, in practice, its use in predicting discrete variables such as risk class belonging is limited by the lack of an out-of-sample evaluation framework.

Using the US O*NET database and its definition of green jobs, 19.4% of US workers could currently be part of the green economy in a broad sense, although a large proportion of green employment would be ‘indirectly’ green, comprising existing jobs that are expected to be in high demand due to greening, but do not require significant changes in tasks, skills, or knowledge. Analysis of task content also shows that green jobs vary in ‘greenness’ with very few jobs only consisting of green tasks, suggesting that the term ‘green’ should be considered a continuum rather than a binary characteristic. While it is easier to transition to indirectly green rather than directly green jobs, greening is likely to involve transitions on a similar scale and scope of existing job transitions.

If an expert is not sure to select one term, weakened hedges would be a natural way to express the uncertainty. This is usually implemented by using a hedge to modify the most possible term, like the expression “more or less good”. To model the uncertainty implied by hedges in QDM, this paper presents a novel linguistic representational and computational model in which the linguistic expressions take the form of a weakened hedge and a linguistic term, which is named as linguistic term with weakened hedge (LTWH). The syntax of LTWHs is defined by a set of hedges and a set of linguistic terms. The semantics of a LTWH is determined, objectively, based on the semantics of the term and a similarity measure of the reference domain. Accordingly, the negation, order relations and some basic operations of LTWHs are defined. To illustrate the effectiveness of LTWHs in granular computing, the connection to some multi-granularity linguistic models is exploited and a process for unifying multi-granularity linguistic information is developed. The major contritions of this paper are: (1) The proposed model enables a new manner to express and operate uncertain linguistic information in QDM; (2) it possesses clear syntax and semantics and the computational results are very interpretable; and (3) the proposed solution of multi-granularity linguistic unification maintains the semantics of the original linguistic information. © 2017","Decision making; Linguistic hedges; Linguistic term sets; Multi-granularity linguistic decision making; Semantics","Computational linguistics; Decision making; Semantics; Syntactics; Wooden fences; Computational results; Linguistic expressions; Linguistic hedges; Linguistic information; Linguistic terms; Multi-granularity; Qualitative decision making; Uncertain linguistic informations; Linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039711584

Schultz introduced the idea of the productivity ""residual"" to agricultural economics (1956). Schultz's main message was that growth in conventional inputs accounted for little of the observed growth in agricultural output, and that there was work to be done by agricultural economists to understand and ultimately eliminate this unexplained residual called ""productivity."" Thus was launched the economics of agricultural productivity as a sub-field within agricultural economics, along with the economics of agricultural R&D and innovation and related government policy. Much progress has been made in the decades since. Still, critical issues remain unresolved. This matters because agricultural innovation and productivity matter, and so do the related policies that rest to some extent on our established understanding of the economic relationships. In this paper I review some unsettled issues related to economic models and measures applied to agricultural R&D and productivity, and some unfinished business in terms of economic and policy questions that are not yet well answered. Before doing that, I present some evidence on agricultural productivity and why it matters. Next, with a nod to ""factology,"" I present available productivity measures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) Center, and compare them in the context of translog cost function models. In subsequent sections I use these and other data to develop new evidence related to two contentious questions: (a) Do farmers benefit from public agricultural R&D? (b) Has U.S. agricultural productivity growth slowed in recent decades? The answers are revealed within. © 2017 The Authors.","agricultural R&D; agricultural transition; productivity; U.S. agriculture","agricultural economics; agricultural policy; agricultural production; agricultural research; agricultural technology; innovation; market transition; policy analysis; productivity; research and development; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043295827

We present a model proposing that commitment to professions influences productivity through a positive effect on intrinsic motivation and a negative effect on extrinsic motivation. Commitment to organizations, conversely, is hypothesized to have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation and a positive effect on extrinsic motivation. We tested the model with a sample of 237 tenured management professors and, overall, the model fit the data well and better than less parsimonious models or ones positing reverse causality. Commitment to the profession was positively related to intrinsic motivation to engage in research and, through this effect, resulted in more challenging research goals, increased commitment to those goals, more hours spent on research, and greater research productivity. Commitment to the organization (university) was positively related to extrinsic motivation and negatively related to intrinsic motivation and was unrelated to goal level, goal commitment, hours spent on research, and research productivity. Our model makes a unique theoretical contribution by revealing the differing paths by which commitments to organizations and professions affect work outcomes, and our results support and extend commitment theory and offer unique insights into posttenure productivity. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","commitment; motivation; productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041355286

Through a comprehensive search and screening process, we identify a total of 19 cross-country econometric studies containing 169 estimates of this relationship. We find that the size and direction of the estimated relationship are affected by a range of factors, most notably the composition of the sample used for estimation, the control variables included in the regression model, and the type of government spending. Overall, we find no clear evidence that higher government spending has played a significant role in reducing income poverty in low- and middle-income countries. This is consistent with the view that fiscal policy plays a much more limited redistributive role in developing countries, in comparison with OECD countries. In addition, we find that the relationship between government spending and poverty is on average less negative for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and more negative for countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, compared to other regions. We also find that the relationship is less negative for government consumption spending, in comparison with other sectors. Finally, we find some evidence indicating the possibility of publication bias. © 2017","fiscal policy; government spending; income poverty; meta-regression analysis; pro-poor growth","developing world; economic growth; fiscal policy; governance approach; income distribution; low income population; meta-analysis; OECD; poverty; public spending; regression analysis; Central Asia; Eastern Europe; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033572578

While most of the attention of science and innovation policy in the last decades has explored the relevance of the interconnections between public and business players in enhancing knowledge-based societies, a major trend has been ignored: both the quota of public R&D and its share over the total R&D investment has shrunk in the majority of OECD countries. As a result, a larger fraction of knowledge is today generated in the business sector. We argue that this is a major problem since public research and private research differ along a number of characteristics, e.g. public access, potential for future technological innovations, criteria of resource allocation.

In general, the empirical findings support the model. In particular, variables at the organisational level (perceived organisational usefulness) and the organisation memberś reactions to the introduction of EVs (subjective norms) are found to be highly important in supporting the acquisition of EVs in commercial pool car fleets. With regard to the perception of vehicle characteristics, environmental benefits and perceived ease of use are identified as relevant antecedents to EV acceptance (support for acquiring EVs).

Informational problems about the supplier’s demand prospects and production capabilities restrict her access to capital. By committing to a minimum purchase quantity, the retailer can mitigate these informational problems and expand the supplier’s feasible production set. We assume a newsvendor model of operations and analyze the strategic interaction of the two parties as a sequential game. Key parameters in our model are the supplier’s ex ante credit limit, her informational transparency—which conditions the amount of additional capital released by the commitment—and the demand characteristics of the final market. We show that in equilibrium the supplier can benefit from a lower ex ante credit limit or lower informational transparency. The retailer always benefits from an increase in these parameters.

We developed a recreation demand model to monetize economic damages associated with lost shoreline recreational user days attributable to the spill. The unprecedented magnitude of the spill disruption led to a variety of innovations. We estimate a model of shoreline recreation trips to the Gulf Coast region from the general population of the contiguous U.S., combining single and multiple-day trips, calculating travel costs that incorporate detailed information on flying costs and transportation mode choice, and using alternative-specific constants to control for site characteristics. Losses per recreational user day are assessed using utility adjustments that reproduce the decline in recreation observed through onsite counts. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate our lost user day value is robust to changes in income imputation, nesting structure, site aggregation and spill calibration, and show the importance of accounting for flying as a mode choice.

Partial understanding and unidimensional interpretation can prevent learning from failure. Building on a practice perspective, we study an iconic case of strategic failure in Formula 1 racing. Our approach, which integrates the decision maker as well as the organizational and material context, identifies three interrelated sources of strategic failure that are worth investigation for decision-makers using DSS and big data: (1) the situated nature and affordances of decision-making; (2) the distributed nature of cognition in decision-making; and (3) the performativity of the DSS.

This study examines the impact of air transportation, railways transportation, and container port traffic on energy demand, customs duty, and economic growth in a panel of 40 heterogeneous countries, which comprises 16 low income & lower middle income (LI&LMI) countries and 24 upper middle & high income (UM&HI) countries for the period of 1990–2015. The study employed panel econometric techniques which account for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. The results show that air-railways transportation has a positive and significant relationship with the energy demand (ED) in aggregated panel, whereas air-railways passengers carried positively influenced ED in LI&LMI countries, and railways transported goods (RT) significantly increases ED in UM&HI countries. Air freight (AF) and railways passengers carried (RPC) escalate customs duty (CUD) in aggregated panel, while RPC positively influences CUD in LI&LMI countries, and AF significantly increases CUD in UM&HI countries. Container port traffic (CPT) positively influenced per capita income (GDPPC) across countries. The causality estimates confirmed the bidirectional relationship, unidirectional, reverse causality, and no causal relationships between the studied variables with different transportation modes. The estimates of impulse response function (IRF) suggest that transportation (except RPC) and growth factors will positively influence ED in aggregated panel while differential impacts of transportation and growth factors will affect CUD over a next 30 years time period. The variance decomposition analysis (VDA) shows that GDPPC will largely influence by ED and least influenced by CUD, while CPT will greatly affect by CUD and least influenced by AF, over a next 30 years period.

Its relevance to the economy of a wide range of countries has made it the subject of analysis of researchers and tourist destination managers alike; in part, due to the increasing competition among tourist destinations. Interest has thus emerged in the design, development and application of methodologies that might allow the competitiveness of tourist destinations to be evaluated. Notwithstanding, many studies reveal shortfalls with regard to the definition and weighting of evaluation criteria. By combining knowledge- and experience-based techniques (i.e. cognitive mapping and the measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH)), this study follows a socio-technical approach, aiming to create a consistent evaluation index for tourist destinations, as a measure of their competitiveness. Grounded on a real-world application, the results were validated both by a panel of experts and the head of one of the largest travel agencies operating in Portugal, and show that cognitive mapping allows the cause-and-effect relationships between determinants of tourist destination competitiveness to be better understood, while MACBETH introduces realism into the calculation of the respective trade-offs.

A proposed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was developed to characterise and identify the environmental profiles and hotspots for five different confectionery products; milk chocolate, dark chocolate, sugar, milk chocolate biscuit and milk-based products. The environmental impact categories are based on Nestle's EcodEX LCA tool which includes Global Warming Potential (GWP), Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), ecosystems quality, and two new indicators previously not considered such as land use and water depletion. Overall, it was found that sugar confectionery had the lowest aggregated environmental impact compared to dark chocolate confectionery which had the highest, primarily due to ingredients. As such, nine key ingredients were identified across the five confectionery products which are recommended for confectionery manufacturers to prioritise e.g. sugar, glucose, starch, milk powder, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk liquid, wheat flour and palm oil. Furthermore, the general environmental hotspots were found to occur at the following life cycle stages: raw materials, factory, and packaging. An analysis of five improvement strategies (e.g. alternative raw materials, packaging materials, renewable energy, product reformulations, and zero waste to landfill) showed both positive and negative environmental impact reduction is possible from cradle-to-grave, especially renewable energy. Surprisingly, the role of product reformulations was found to achieve moderate-to-low environmental reductions with waste reductions having low impacts. The majority of reductions was found to be achieved by focusing on sourcing raw materials with lower environmental impacts, product reformulations, and reducing waste generating an aggregated environmental reduction of 46%. Overall, this research provides many insights of the environmental impacts for a range of different confectionery products, especially how actors across the confectionery supply chain can improve the environmental sustainability performance. It is expected the findings from this research will serve as a base for future improvements, research and policies for confectionery manufacturers, supply chain actors, policy makers, and research institutes towards an environmentally sustainable confectionery industry. © 2017 The Authors","Chocolate; Confectionery; Environmental sustainability; Food industry; Life cycle assessment; MCDA","Decision making; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Global warming; Land use; Liquid sugar; Manufacture; Oils and fats; Packaging materials; Palm oil; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Chocolate; Confectionery; Environmental sustainability; Food industries; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); MCDA; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041096661

This research also explores the influence of customer sensitivity (CSy) to price and delivery lead time and supply risk (SR) within those approximations. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was used to collect the primary data for this research. Data were collected from 69 respondents working for organisations in two industrial segments within the UK manufacturing sector: ""Industrial and Commercial Machinery and Computer Equipment"" and ""Measuring, Analysing and Controlling Instruments, Photographic, Medical and Optical Instruments"". The respondents worked for entities that were categorised in three groups: customers, suppliers, and entities that were both customers and suppliers. The groups that were self-identified as ""customers"" or ""suppliers"" answered 20 survey items each and the group that was identified as both ""customers"" and ""suppliers"" answered 40 survey items. Findings - The results revealed that AM was considered a suitable vehicle for the fulfilment of SP demand. However, AM appeared to make no material difference to CS; the scenario used improved delivery time of SP but increased price. Also, AM was thought to improve IP through less reliance on buffer stock to manage SR and spikes in demand and less carrying of SP at risk of obsolescence. Research limitations/implications - The respondents worked for entities within two manufacturing industry segments within the UK and the insights garnered may not be indicative of similar organisations competing in other manufacturing industry segments within the UK or in other countries. In addition, approximately 82 per cent of the surveyed respondents worked for small organisations with fewer than 100 employees and the results may differ for larger organisations. Further limitations were the relatively small sample size and lack of open-ended questions used in the survey. Larger sample size and the usage of open-ended survey questions may lead to more reliable and valuable responses and feedback. Practical implications - The findings from this research are considered to be of interest to practitioners contemplating adoption of AM and to developers of AM wishing to increase market share due to the positive reaction of entities within the industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment, and measuring, analysing and controlling instrumentation industrial segments. This research raises awareness to the possible risks and rewards - from a range of perspectives, of AM to practitioners considering its adoption in the spare parts supply chain (SPSC). Originality/value - The paper takes a novel perspective on AM in SPSCs by illuminating the supplier and buyer perspective based on empirical data. This research provides new insights about the appreciation of the use of AM in SPSCs of mostly small sized manufacturing companies located in the UK. This paper also gives new insights about the willingness/conditions of manufacturing companies in the UK to adopt AM for the provision of SP. The originality of this research is twofold: it broached the applicability of AM in the supply chains of the two targeted industrial segments, and as far as the authors are aware, the influence of CSy (e.g. To price or lead time) and SR on SPSC players' attitude to AM is yet to be considered. Finally, this research adopted a systems theory lens and considered system-wide impact of AM introduction. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Business performance; Customer satisfaction; Inventory management; Supply chains","3D printers; Additives; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Inventory control; Machinery; Obsolescence; Sales; Supply chains; Surveys; Business performance; Design/methodology/approach; Inventory management; Inventory performance; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing organisations; Open-ended questions; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039172177

Discovering effective features or representations from check-in data is the key to POI recommendation. Deep learning is a representation-learning method with multiple levels for discovering intrinsic features to better represent user preferences. We analyzed users’ check-in behavior in detail and developed a deep learning model to integrate geographical and social influences for POI recommendation tasks. We used a semi-restricted Boltzmann machine to model the geographical similarity and a conditional layer to model the social influence. Experiments with real-world LBSNs showed that our method performed better than other state-of-the-art methods.

Many brownfields have been regenerated for various uses, addressing a range of extant problems in urban areas. However, re-use plans for current brownfields are driven by market demand and public sector prioritization and do not always meet the requirements of local residents and visitors. In this paper, we investigate how a range of brownfields re-use options are perceived by residents and visitors to the Landek area in the city of Ostrava (Czech Republic). By analysing the results of the questionnaire survey (n = 180) we found that future brownfields uses such as culture/sport and children's park are the most popular options. We found that gender was a statistically significant predictor of preferred reuse options. Women are strong supporters of the above-mentioned re-use options, while men tend to favour re-use options which promote industry. Remarkably, respondents, in general, lacked concrete ideas concerning alternative re-use options of brownfields, suggesting that professional urban planners can be of assistance in the planning of the future use of brownfield sites. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Czech Republic; Perception; Re-use options; Regeneration of brownfields; Urban renewal","Sensory perception; Surveys; Brownfield sites; Brownfields; Czech Republic; Industrial city; Local residents; Questionnaire surveys; Urban planners; Urban renewal; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047300986

The opportunity to move emergency patients who have been selected for admission out of the emergency department (ED) is linked to the ability of the hospital network to actually admit them. The latter is, in turn, correlated to the availability of inpatient beds in the hospital wards, which are shared resources between elective and emergency patients. Due to the overcrowding of EDs and the growing concern regarding reducing the number of inpatient ward beds, it is thus becoming crucial to improve the bed capacity planning and the management of emergency and elective patient admissions. In this direction, greater coordination and communication among the different healthcare providers involved in the pathway flows is required, and the so-called “bed management” function plays a key role. This study starts with collaboration with the local health government (LHG) of the Liguria region aimed at studying the hospital bed management function. A large quantity of data records have been collected during one year of activity to obtain information related to the flow of emergency and elective patient pathways. A medium-sized hospital located in the city of Genova has been chosen as a case study, and a discrete event simulation model has been developed to reproduce the multiple patient flows involved in the system. Multiobjective optimization analysis has been performed to choose the best bed allocations considering both operational and tactical decisions characterized by various trade-offs among alternative conflicting objectives. The model can be used to help decision makers find a representative set of Pareto-optimal solutions and quantify trade-offs when satisfying different objectives. © 2016 The Authors.

However, consumers are likely to overstate the effect that these labels have on their purchasing behavior. Moreover, existing consumer segmentation frameworks do not distinguish among product labels based on whether they offer public benefits (e.g., environmental benefits, animal welfare, social equity) vs. private benefits (e.g., cost savings, health benefits) vs. both. This article addresses these gap by 1) developing a consumer segmentation based on consumers' actual purchases of sustainability and health-related products and 2) differentiating product labels based on the benefits they offer – public, private or both. Using cluster analysis, it assesses the actual daily consumption of 132 Italian consumers over 30 months and more than 370,000 transactions. The results indicate three segments of consumers: collectivists, individualists and indifferents. Moreover, the findings show that consumer segments are affected differently depending on whether a product label promises either public benefits, private benefits or both. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer purchases; Consumers; Health-related labels; Market segmentation; Private benefits; Product labels; Public benefits; Self-report bias; Sustainability labels","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Health; Purchasing; Sales; Sustainable development; Consumer purchase; Consumers; Market segmentation; Private benefits; Product labels; Public benefits; Self reports; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046662829

This study uses the Shanghai PT in China as the case study to apply the theoretical model. The results reveal that PT service quality is the most important factor that influences a passenger's willingness to remain loyal.

This paper investigates how the feedback information on a crowdsourcing platform and systematic bias of crowdsourcing workers can affect crowdsourcing outcomes. Specifically, using archival data from the online crowdsourcing platform Kaggle, combined with survey data from actual Kaggle contest participants, we examine the role of a systematic bias, namely, the salience bias, in influencing the performance of the crowdsourcing workers and how the number of crowdsourcing workers moderates the impact of the salience bias on the outcomes of contests. Our results suggest that the salience bias influences the performance of contestants, including the winners of the contests. Furthermore, the number of participating contestants may attenuate or amplify the impact of the salience bias on the outcomes of contests, depending on the effort required to complete the tasks. Our results have critical implications for crowdsourcing firms and platform designers. © 2018 INFORMS.","Behavioral economics; Competition effect; Crowdsourcing; Open innovation; Parallel path effect; Salience bias","Economics; Surveys; Behavioral economics; Competition effects; Open innovation; Parallel path; Salience bias; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048536100

Objectives: This study examines how satisfied the Saudi people are with their public sector healthcare services and assesses their willingness to contribute to financing the system through a national health insurance scheme. The study also examines public preferences and expectations of a future national health insurance system. Methods: A total of 36 heads of households participated in face-to-face audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. The participants were purposefully selected based on different socio-economic and socio-demographic factors from urban and rural areas to represent the geographical diversity that would presumably influence individual views, expectations, preferences and healthcare experiences. Results: The evidence showed some dissatisfaction with the provision and quality of current public sector healthcare services, including the availability of appointments, waiting times and the availability of drugs. The households indicated a willingness to contribute to a national insurance scheme, conditional upon improvements in the quality of public sector healthcare services. The results also revealed a variety of preferences and expectations regarding the proposed national health insurance scheme. Conclusions: Quality improvement is a key factor that could motivate the Saudi people to contribute to financing the healthcare system.

This paper evaluated the performance of an integrated two-stage system using a proposed type-2 fuzzy bi-objective two-stage slacks-based measurement Data Envelopment Analysis model with super efficiency. A Step Method was applied to solve for the Pareto optimal solution to ensure no implicit priority was given to one stage over the other, and a CV-based reduction method and generalized credibility based chance constrained programming were used to cope with the type-2 fuzzy variables. A case study in China was then developed from a time-perspective and a region-perspective, the results from which indicated that the overall performance of China's integrated system improved from 2005 to 2014, and the efficiency gap between the industrial production system and the environmental management system reduced, however, there was significant disparity shown across the different economic regions. Three comparative analyses were then conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed model. The developed model was able to: measure efficiency scores and find proportionate ratios and disproportionate slacks for each DMU to decrease inputs for performance improvement, distinguish the DMU from DMUs with same efficiency value and indicate the maximum change scope for the inputs and outputs to maintain the DMU efficiency. In addition, type-2 fuzzy sets were incorporated to describe the fuzziness with greater flexibility, which can assist decision makers and produce more accurate, robust results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","DEA; Economic efficiency and environmental efficiency; Industrial production and environmental management system; Overall efficiency","Computer programming; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental management; Environmental management systems; Industrial economics; Pareto principle; Sustainable development; Chance-constrained programming; Comparative analysis; Data envelopment analysis models; Environmental efficiency; Industrial production; Overall efficiency; Pareto optimal solutions; Type-2 fuzzy variables; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032870008

As a new kind of Information Technology (IT) commercial model, understanding the economics of cloud computing becomes critically important. From the cloud service providers' perspective, profit maximization is the top issue for them. Because a multi-server system is devoted to serving one type of service requests and application, service providers should build multiple multi-server systems to satisfy the market requirements of different application domains. Because available funding for a service provider is generally limited, it cannot afford to invest in all application domains. Hence, how to select appropriate application domains for investment and allocate funding such that the total profit is maximized are important issues for service providers. To address this problem, a fund-constrained profit maximization model is proposed. However, the exact solution of this optimization model is very difficult to formulate due to its complexity. Hence, this paper presents a heuristic strategy to search for a high quality solution. In our strategy, the optimization problem is solved in four stages, and the solution is optimized gradually. Through the proposed heuristic investment strategy, an appropriate investment scheme can be developed that synthesizes the market requirement, the fund constraint, the service level agreement, and so forth. A series of numerical calculations is executed to assess the performance of the proposed strategy. Then, six other investment strategies are compared to our strategy. Our results show that the investment scheme designed using our strategy can produce much more profit than these six other strategies. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; deadline; fund allocation; multi-server system; profit maximization; queuing model; service-level agreement; waiting time","Cloud computing; Commerce; Optimization; Profitability; Queueing theory; Strategic planning; deadline; Fund allocation; Multi-server; Profit maximization; Queuing models; Service Level Agreements; Waiting-time; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048433221

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, to test the premise of self-selection theory whether the association between productivity and export is maintained in high-corruption environments, and second to identify other variables explaining export activity in high-corruption contexts, including cluster networks and firms’ competences. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on the World Bank Enterprise survey to undertake a cross-section analysis including 1,233 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) located in nine African countries. The advantage of this database is that it contains information about the level of perceived corruption at firm level. Logistic regressions are performed for the full sample and for subsamples of firms in high- and low-corruption environments. Findings: The findings demonstrate that the self-selection theory only applies to low-corruption environments, whereas in high-corruption environments, alternative factors such as cluster networks and outward-looking competences (OLC) exert a stronger influence on the exporting activity of African SMEs. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to the theory as it provides evidence that contradicts the validity of self-selection theory in high-corruption environments. The findings would benefit from further longitudinal investigation. Practical implications: African SMEs need to consider cluster networks and OLC as important strategic factors that might enhance their international competitiveness. Originality/value: The criticism of the self-selection theory is distinctive in the literature and has important implications for future research.

Different from the previous studies, the PSO-ELM models require no statistical inference nor distribution assumption of the model parameters, but rather focus on generating the prediction intervals (PIs) that can minimize a multi-objective function which considers two criteria, reliability and interval sharpness. The improved PSO-ELM models are developed for an hourly border crossing traffic dataset and compared to: (1) the original PSO-ELMs; (2) two state of the art models proposed by Zhang et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2014) separately; and (3) the traditional ARMA and Kalman filter models. The results show that the improved PSO-ELM can always keep the mean PI length the lowest, and guarantee that the PI coverage probability is higher than the corresponding PI nominal confidence, regardless of the confidence level assumed. The study also probes the reasons that led to a few points being not covered by the PIs of PSO-ELMs. Finally, the study proposes a comprehensive optimization framework to make staffing plans for border crossing authority based on bounds of PIs and point predictions. The results show that for holidays, the staffing plans based on PI upper bounds generated much lower total system costs, and that those plans derived from PI upper bounds of the improved PSO-ELM models, are capable of producing the lowest average waiting times at the border. For a weekday or a typical Monday, the workforce plans based on point predictions from Zhang et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2014) models generated the smallest system costs with low border crossing delays. Moreover, for both holiday and normal Monday scenarios, if the border crossing authority lacked the required staff to implement the plans based on PI upper bounds or point predictions, the staffing plans based on PI lower bounds from the improved PSO-ELMs performed the best, with an acceptable level of service and total system costs close to the point prediction plans. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","GARCH; Kalman filter; Prediction interval; PSO-ELM; Reliability; Sharpness; Staffing plan; Uncertainty; Waiting time","Forecasting; Kalman filters; Machine learning; Passive filters; Personnel selection; Reliability; Traffic control; Uncertainty analysis; GARCH; Prediction interval; PSO-ELM; Sharpness; Staffing plan; Uncertainty; Waiting-time; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); artificial neural network; Kalman filter; machine learning; planning method; planning process; prediction; quantitative analysis; traffic management; transportation planning; uncertainty analysis; Ulmus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047176727

In this case, DMUs are partitioned into different groups, each operating in the same technology. In contrast, the metatechnology includes all DMUs and represents all production possibilities that can in principle be achieved in different production environments. Often, the metatechnology cannot be assumed to be a convex set. In such cases, benchmarking a DMU against the common metafrontier requires implementing either an enumeration algorithm and solving a linear program at each of its steps, or solving an equivalent mixed integer linear program. In this paper we show that the same task can be accomplished by solving a single linear program.

Newly integrated constructs significantly improved the prediction power of the theory. In addition, results of the structural equation modeling generally supported the proposed relationships. Moreover, a salient role of moral norm was identified. As expected, new environmental paradigm, awareness of consequences, ascribed responsibility, and moral norm played an important mediating role.

Classic real options models fail to account for the value of proactive uncertainty-reducing mitigations, since they assume that uncertainty is fixed or follows a continuous, time-dependent dynamics. We present adaptations of these models that address this shortcoming. In our models, zero or more mitigations can be applied in varying sequences, mitigations have impulse-type effects on uncertainty reduction, and mitigations' effects can be complementary, substitutive, or synergetic. These traits make the value of mitigations path dependent and conditional on the uncertainty-reduction ability of earlier deployed mitigations. We operationalize the effects of mitigations in the IT and cybersecurity investment contexts. We also apply the adapted models to a real-world cybersecurity investment case from a Japanese company. Investments in multiple cybersecurity mitigations are typically treated as having a multiplicative effect that leads to overinvestment in mitigations. Our models avoid this problem, permitting to lower cybersecurity costs without compromising on loss prevention. More generally, our models allow implementing the real options logic more fully by supporting both passive and proactive IT investment risk management. © 2018 INFORMS.","Active risk management; Cybersecurity investments; IT investment risk management; Real options models; Uncertainty-reducing mitigations","Decision making; Risk management; Cyber security; Information technology investments; Investment decision making; IT investments; Managerial flexibility; Real Options; Time-dependent dynamics; Uncertainty-reducing mitigations; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048677870

Statistical evidence, based on OECD data, reveals that (very) high rates of R&D intensity and tax on corporate profits do not maximize the labour productivity of nations. In particular, the models here suggest that the R&D intensity equal to about 2.5% and tax on corporate profits equal to 3.1% of the GDP seem to maximize the labour productivity of countries. Beyond these optimal thresholds, the labor productivity begins to decrease. These results can be explained by the curvilinear relationship between labour productivity and R&D intensity, and between labour productivity and tax on corporate profits. Some factors and environmental determinants of these results are discussed. These findings can clarify whenever possible, some sources of labor productivity and suggest a research and industrial policy of optimal rates of R&D intensity and tax on corporate profits (as percentage of GDP) directed to support competitive advantage, technological innovation and wealth creation of nations over time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Curvilinear relation; Innovation; Labour; OECD countries; Optimization; Productivity; R&D intensity; R&D investment; Tax on corporate profits; Technology transfer","Competition; Industrial research; Optimization; Profitability; Taxation; Technology transfer; Competitive advantage; Corporate profits; Curvilinear relation; Environmental determinants; Labour; Labour productivities; OECD countries; Technological innovation; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016113265

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which constitute a driving force of economic growth, employment and total value added, remain highly vulnerable to and ill prepared for such environmental perturbations. This study investigates barriers to SMEs’ resilience to EWEs in an attempt to shed light on enabling factors that can define effective organizational responses to non-linear environmental stimuli. Relying on structural equation modeling and data gathered from 109 SMEs that recently experienced EWE impacts, we link the general concept of SMEs’ resilience barriers to EWEs with a series of elements to determine specific internal and external factors that contribute the most to EWE resilience. In particular, external barriers of institutional conditions and mechanisms of support and guidance as well as internal barriers of resources and managerial perceptions are found to be the most critical ones in determining resilience. The assessment offers essential research evidence for practitioners on SME management and sets forth linkages with current mechanisms for policy interventions towards an appropriate resilience agenda for SMEs.

The results showed that government pressure, economic pressure and internal pressure played significant positive roles in environmental behavior of papermaking companies in China. Economic pressure was the most important factor on environmental behaviors (including defensive, accommodative and proactive behaviors) of papermaking companies. Furthermore, the role of internal pressure on CEB (defensive and proactive) was second only to economic pressure, while the role of government pressure on CEB was much weaker than our expectation. However, the role of social pressure, which was imposed by general public and environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), was not significant. Thus, policy makers should emphasize on the interactions of economic mechanism, government regulation and internal incentive mechanism to stimulate firms to adopt active environmental behavior. More concerns from the general public shall be addressed to enhance their driving effect on CEB in Chinese papermaking industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Corporate environmental behavior; External and internal pressures; Papermaking enterprises","Decision making; Environmental impact; Papermaking; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Surveys; China; Environmental behavior; Environmental non-governmental organizations; Environmental pollutions; Environmental problems; Internal pressures; Questionnaire surveys; Structural equation modeling; Environmental regulations; Paper Making; Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038874294

However, in a lot of developing countries, the application of OSC still lags behind. Although a number of research efforts have focused on identifying the OSC barriers, they are limited to qualitative descriptions, which lacks the understanding of the interrelationships among the barriers. To address this gap, this paper proposed a methodology for identifying the OSC barriers and their cause-effect relationships. The proposed methodology is composed of three phases: (1) a comprehensive literature review and in-depth interview with the OSC industry experts, (2) questionnaire survey and focus group discussion, and (3) grey DEMATEL analysis. The proposed methodology was applied in the context of China’s construction industry. The results of the grey DEMATEL analysis provided the cause-effect relationships of the 35 identified OSC barriers, which indicated six important aspects be taken into deeper consideration, such as governmental regulations and incentives, OSC practices and experiences, as well as traditional construction method transformation. The outcomes of this study will support policymakers and OSC participants to identify the influencing OSC barriers and their interrelationships, as well as propose appropriate strategies for overcoming the barriers and broadening the OSC application. © 2018 The Author(s).","Barriers; Case of China; Developing countries; Grey DEMATEL analysis; Off-site construction (OSC); Relationship identification","Construction industry; Developing countries; Barriers; Cause-effect relationships; DEMATEL; Governmental regulations; In-depth interviews; Off-site construction; Questionnaire surveys; Traditional constructions; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053470830

In this survey, we examine the contributions of queueing theory (QT) in modeling EDs and assess the strengths and limitations of this application. We include a direct comparison to discrete-event simulation when applied to similar problems, and discuss data acquisition and challenges associated with each method. Specifically, we review applications of QT from the perspective of demand- and supply-side problems, as well as various methodological innovations developed to address the complexities of ED operations. In reviewing relevant articles published since 1970, we found that queueing models tend to oversimplify operations and underestimate congestion levels (especially for smaller systems), and obtain less realistic results than comparable simulation models. The combination of queueing and simulation is shown to be a powerful approach. Future efforts should exploit this and more widely available real-world data. © 2017 The Authors.

The effects of uncertainty vary significantly by firm size. When faced with high price uncertainty, large firms increase their hedging intensity but do not lower capital investment or debt issuance. In contrast, small firms do not adjust their hedging intensity but significantly lower capital expenditure and debt issuance even after controlling for investment demand. Moreover, the negative effect of uncertainty on capital investment is significantly weaker for firms that hedge their output price risk. Our analysis highlights that, in the presence of financial frictions, high price uncertainty has significant dampening effects on capital investment of small firms by exacerbating their financial constraints, and that this negative effect is amplified by firm-level constraints on ability to hedge risk exposures. © 2017 INFORMS.","Capital investment; Financial frictions; Hedging; Real options; Uncertainty","Friction; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Wooden fences; Capital expenditures; Capital investment; Dampening effects; Financial constraints; Hedging; Price uncertainty; Real Options; Uncertainty; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060544168

The salient role of moral obligation in building the towel reuse intention was also uncovered. Moreover, towel reuse behaviour in everyday life had a significant moderating role in the proposed theoretical framework. Overall, towel reuse intentions in guests were sufficiently accounted for by research variables.

However, it is problematic due to the difficulty in quantification of certain risks, existence of interactions, and multiattribute structure of the project risk assessment task. This paper reports research in which relevant risks were identified for power and transport infrastructure public-private partnership (PPP) projects, which are globally the most active infrastructure sectors for private investment. It further proposes, demonstrates, and validates a novel multiattribute risk assessment model that supports both sectoral and project risk analysis to assist stakeholders in risk management decision making. A 45-factor risk register, established based on literature review and PPP experts' interviews, was administered to solicit industry-wide perceptions for risk assessment. Application of fuzzy set theory to risk analysis revealed 22 critical risk factors (CRFs) that were categorized into seven critical risk groups (CRGs) of correlated factors using factor analysis. Risk factors that achieved a linguistic assessment of high impact reflect issues related to institutional capacity and the local economy. Further analysis based on fuzzy measure and nonadditive fuzzy integral combined with arithmetic mean helped to obtain an overall risk index (ORI) which indicated a moderate risk outlook for both power and transport infrastructure sectors. Whereas public sector maturity was assessed as a high impact CRG in the power sector, project planning and implementation, project finance, and project revenue were additionally rated as high impact CRGs in the transport infrastructure sector. Demonstration of the developed methodology for a build-operate-transfer (BOT) motorway case study project showed that the private sector stakeholders viewed the project at high risk with all the CRGs evaluated as high impact except the political stability CRG, which was assessed as moderately risky. Test results show that the methodology performed satisfactorily in approximating experts holistic project risk assessments. The developed framework can be used to assess a country's condition or overall project risk at the initial project stage with little input of time and resources, thus facilitating an efficient and robust risk assessment. Application of fuzzy measure based nonadditive fuzzy integral combined with arithmetic mean for sectoral and project risk assessment, and comparison of sectoral risk analysis from a developing country perspective are some of the key features of this study. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Decision making; Fuzzy integral; Fuzzy set theory; Infrastructure public-private partnerships; Risk analysis","Decision making; Decision theory; Developing countries; Economics; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Integral equations; Investments; Mergers and acquisitions; Project management; Public risks; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Technology transfer; Build operate transfers; Fuzzy integral; Institutional capacities; Management decision-making; Multi-attribute risk assessments; Non-additive fuzzy integral; Public private partnerships; Transport infrastructure; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054824312

We do this through a review of the rich literature on forest governance in Ghana and the results of 160 semi-structured interviews with relevant actors in the country. While we agree that the VPA has helped establish new fora for dialogue in the forest sector in Ghana, we argue that it has not fundamentally changed the existing forest governance regime. Specifically, the VPA implementation has not changed tree tenure and benefit sharing practices, and by extension, the forestry concession system that for over 8 decades has failed to secure forest sustainability and social equity. The changes introduced through the VPA implementation – the Timber Legality Assurance System, updated forest management plans, and an artisanal milling strategy, largely represent technical fixes to deeply political processes that have long upheld unsustainable practices. Other changes such as enhanced enforcement of Social Responsibility Agreements and more transparent allocations of timber rights are improvements, but they do not fundamentally change the tenure and benefit sharing arrangement, which by any standard is inequitable. Our evidence particularly contradicts Overdevest and Zeitlin's (2016, 2018) depiction of the country's VPA experience as an emerging ‘experimentalist’ forest governance entailing substantive dialogue, recursive problem-solving, and policy learning. At the contrary, and paradoxically, we argue that the VPA implementation in Ghana serves to stabilize and reproduce the very forest governance regime that it set out to reform– a process that is much less ‘experimental’ and much more business as usual. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Contracts; Economic and social effects; International trade; Law enforcement; Problem solving; Timber; Business-as-usual; Forest management plans; Forest sustainability; Milling strategies; Partnership agreements; Political process; Semi structured interviews; Social responsibilities; Forestry; Commerce; Contracts; Foreign Trade; Forest Management; Forestry; Ghana; Problem Solving; Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052224716

In doing so, this initiates a process of rework, which is a problem that the industry has incessantly aimed to redress for decades with limited success. Rework is a ‘known-unknown’, but there remains a high degree of uncertainty about its costs. Such uncertainty occurs as there is a proclivity for the costs associated with rework to be largely ignored, concealed or considered to be normal function of operations. This paper presents the results from the first longitudinal and in-depth study of rework costs in construction. Based on a sample of 19,605 rework events derived from 346 construction projects delivered by a contractor between the years 2009 and 2015, it was revealed that their mean yearly profit over the period of analysis was reduced by a staggering 28%. In addition, 88 (0.45%) of the total 19,605 rework events accounted for 34% of the total costs that were incurred. The complete cost data for 98 of the 346 projects was made available, which enabled a mean rework cost of 0.39% of contract value to be determined. The research provides construction organizations with an improved understanding of the nature and likelihood of rework costs enabling them to move from a position of being a ‘known-unknown’ to becoming a ‘known-known’. Being able to ‘anticipate what might go wrong’ and ensure that risk management and controls are put in place throughout the construction process will contribute to their dynamic capability. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Construction; costs; information; learning; profit; quality; rework","Construction; Costs; Image quality; Risk management; Construction organizations; Construction projects; Contractual requirements; Degree of uncertainty; information; learning; Management and controls; rework; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055970637

The core of available methods on ITS analysis is based on various applications of conventional linear modeling. However, few works have considered possible nonlinearities in ITS data. In this paper, we propose a new class of threshold autoregressive interval (TARI) models for ITS data. By matching the interval model with interval observations, we develop a minimum-distance estimation method for TARI models, and establish the asymptotic theory for the proposed estimators. We show that the threshold parameter estimator is T-consistent and follows an asymptotic compound Poisson process as the sample size T→∞. And the estimators for other TARI model parameters are root-T consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulation studies show that the proposed TARI model provides more accurate out-of-sample forecasts than the existing center–radius self-exciting threshold (CR-SETAR) model for ITS data in the literature. Empirical applications to the S&P 500 Price Index document significant asymmetric reactions of the stock markets in Japan, U.K. and France to shocks from the U.S. stock market and that incorporating this asymmetric effect yield better out-of-sample forecasts than a variety of popular models available in the literature. © 2018","Asymmetric reaction; Interval-valued data; Minimum distance estimation; Nonlinearity; Symbolic data; Threshold autoregressive interval models","Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Time series; Asymmetric reaction; Interval models; Interval-valued data; Minimum distance estimations; Nonlinearity; Symbolic data; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052105097

However, hybrid car adoption remains low, which impedes the move towards a lower carbon economy. In this paper, we examine the risks and drivers of hybrid car purchases, drawing on consumer behaviour and cultural dimensions theory to account for the heterogeneous, segmented nature of the market. As risk perceptions differ across cultures, and in order to address the lack of cross cultural research on eco-friendly cars, we focus on Australian, South Korean, and Japanese consumers. Based on a survey of 817 respondents we examine how five types of risk (social, psychological, time, financial, and network externalities) and three factors that drive purchasing behaviour (product advantages, product attractiveness, and product superiority) influence consumers perceptions of hybrid cars. Four segments of consumers are identified (pessimists, realists, optimists, and casualists) that also vary according to their environmental self-image, and underlying cultural values.

We extend the literature on financial literacy by examining its role in the purchase of energy consumer durables; a setting purported to suffer from sub-optimal levels of investment due to consumer mistakes. We augment a standard choice experiment for purchasing a hot water system with data on financial literacy. Financial literacy is an economically important and statistically significant determinant of investment in energy efficiency. This result is robust to incorporating individual discount rates and risk aversion, as well as standard controls such as income and education, indicating that financial literacy is not merely a proxy for standard demographic characteristics. Financial literacy also makes choices more consistent with standard consumer preferences and increases the probability that respondents select investments with the lowest lifetime discounted costs. The results establish low financial literacy as a mechanism driving low investment in energy efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Consumer durables; Energy efficiency; Energy efficiency gap; Financial literacy","Investments; Purchasing; Choice experiments; Consumer durables; Consumer preferences; Demographic characteristics; Discounted costs; Energy-efficiency gaps; Financial decisions; Financial literacy; Energy efficiency; consumption behavior; demography; discrete choice analysis; energy efficiency; financial system; investment; risk assessment; standard (regulation); statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047933992

These administrative controls can take the form of board-like joint committees having explicitly delineated authority over certain alliance activities. We illuminate governing committees as an important, albeit neglected, instrument for administrative control in the governance of non-equity alliances, and we demonstrate that these organizational mechanisms facilitate knowledge flows within the scope of an alliance. We also show that governing committees safeguard against misappropriation hazards, particularly when a partner possesses the incentive and ability to engage in such behavior. This study extends alliance governance research beyond the implications of the equity-nonequity dichotomy to consider a wider and richer gamut of governance instruments available to address the challenges associated with knowledge transfers in alliances. Managerial Summary: Non-equity alliances are important vehicles to collaborate with external partners, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry and other high-tech sectors. To guide these collaborations effectively, partners can use the contract to custom-build jointly-staffed managerial units with clearly demarcated decision-making responsibilities. We demonstrate that these organizational mechanisms facilitate knowledge flows within the scope of an alliance. We also show that governing committees also safeguard against misappropriation hazards, particularly when a partner values a firm's knowledge highly, or it possesses the required ability to absorb and assimilate a firm's knowledge. Our results imply that contractually-defined managerial interfaces provide a channel to regulate knowledge-sharing in collaborative alliances.

Many firms host multiple, successive open innovation contests in response to different, creative challenges they face. To encourage customers to participate and make an effort in such contests, they offer monetary rewards of varying sizes. Although prior research has investigated the optimal reward design for one-time contests, little is known about how the rewards offered in a contest can influence individuals’ ongoing level of participation and their creative effort in subsequent contests. Receiving a reward is a form of positive competence feedback that influences individuals’ feelings of competence and intrinsic motivation. Based on cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that these feelings can persist after a contest ends, influencing positively participation and creative efforts in later contests. Our online experiment and also our analysis of the data from an actual open innovation platform show that individuals tend to cease participating in subsequent contests, significantly reducing the size of the crowd over time. Receiving a reward and positive competence feedback alleviates this tendency. Therefore, offering more prizes motivates more high-performing individuals to participate again and to put in more creative effort, which in turn raise the average quality as well as the best quality in subsequent contests. These findings suggest that in successive open innovation contests, multiple rewards not only encourage greater participation, but also promote better quality outcomes. Thus, firms are well advised to expand the positive reward feedback in contests, as doing so will help them to maintain a sizable and motivated crowd of contestants. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Intrinsic motivation; Monetary rewards; Multiple rewards; On-line experiments; One-time; Open innovation; Optimal reward; Winner take alls",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031396188

Peer influence can arise from immediate neighbors in the network (formally defined as cohesion or direct ties with one-hop neighbors) and from indirect peers who share common neighbors (formally defined as structural equivalence or indirect ties with two-hop neighbors). While the literature examined the role of each peer influence (direct or indirect) separately, the study of both peer network effects acting simultaneously was ignored, largely because of methodological constraints. This paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the simultaneous effect of both direct and indirect peer influences in technology adoption in the context of caller ringback tone (CRBT) in a cellular telephone network, using data from 200 million calls by 1.4 million users. Given that such a large-scale network makes traditional social network analysis intractable, we extract many densely connected and self-contained subpopulations from the network. We find a regularity in these subpopulations in that they consist either of about 200 nodes or about 500 nodes. Using these subpopulations and panel data, we analyze direct and indirect peer influences using a novel autoprobit model with multiple network terms (direct and indirect peer influence, with homophily as a control variable). Our identification strategy relies on a newly designed spatial autoregressive model, allowing us to identify the direct and indirect peer influences on each of the extracted subpopulations. We use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations. The results show CRBT adoption to be simultaneously determined by both direct and indirect peer influence (while controlling for homophily and centrality). Robustness checks show model fit to improve when both peer influences are included. The size and direction of the two peer influences, however, differ by group size. Interestingly, indirect peer influence (structural equivalence) plays a negative role in diffusion when group size is about 200, but a positive role when group size is about 500. The role of direct peer influence (cohesion), on the other hand, is always positive, irrespective of group size. Our findings imply that businesses must design different target strategies for large versus small groups: for large groups, businesses should focus on consumers with both multiple one-hop and two-hop neighbors; for small groups, businesses should only focus on consumers with multiple one-hop neighbors. © 2018 INFORMS.","Caller ringback tone (CRBT); Cohesion; Network effects; Peer influence; Structural equivalence","Cellular telephone systems; Cellular telephones; Caller ringback tone (CRBT); Cohesion; Network effects; Peer influence; Structural equivalence; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048683829

This method is routinely used in environmental economics to derive the economic valuation of environmental attributes such as air pollution and water quality. For example, the “Ricardian approach” is based on a hedonic regression of land values on historical climate variables. Forecasts of future climate can then be employed to estimate the future costs of climate change. We show that this approach is only valid if current land markets ignore climate forecasts. While this assumption was defensible decades ago (when this literature first emerged), it is reasonable to hypothesize that information on climate change is so pervasive today that markets may already price in expectations of future climate change. Indeed, we show empirically that agricultural land markets in the United States now capitalize expectations about future climate change. We derive a straightforward empirical correction to the standard Ricardian approach (called the “Forward-Looking Ricardian Approach”) that can be implemented with readily available data.

Consequently, consumers can strategically time their purchases, weighing the costs of monitoring and the risk of inventory depletion against prospectively lower prices. At the same time, firms can observe and exploit their customers' monitoring behavior. Using a data set tracking customers of a North American specialty retail brand, we present empirical evidence that monitoring products online is associated with successfully obtaining discounts. We develop a structural model of consumers' dynamic monitoring to find substantial heterogeneity, with consumers' opportunity costs for an online visit ranging from $2 to $25 in inverse relation to their price elasticities. Our estimation results have important implications for retail operations. The randomized markdown policy benefits retailers by combining price commitment with the exploitation of heterogeneity in consumers' monitoring costs. We estimate that the retailer's profit under randomized markdowns is 81% higher than from subgame-perfect, state-contingent pricing, because the retailer need not limit its inventory to credibly limit markdowns, which permits its jointly optimal inventory stock to expand by 133%. The welfare gain from these larger inventories splits nearly equally into retailer profit and consumer surplus. We also discuss targeting customers with price promotions using their online histories and the implications of reducing consumers' monitoring costs. © 2017 INFORMS.","Continuous-time stochastic game; Dynamic consumer behavior; Price commitment; Price discrimination; Revenue management; Structural estimation","Continuous time systems; Cost reduction; Monitoring; Profitability; Sales; Stochastic systems; Price commitment; Price discrimination; Revenue management; Stochastic game; Structural estimation; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045211386

This study formulates the top persuader prediction problem and develops a novel method to predict top persuaders. Our method development is rooted in eminent social network theories that reveal several forces central to social persuasion, including social influence, entity similarity, and structural equivalence. Our method innovatively integrates these forces to predict top persuaders in a social network, in contrast to existing methods that primarily focus on social influence. Specifically, we introduce persuasion probability that denotes the likelihood of persuasion conditioned on these forces. We then propose how to estimate persuasion probabilities, develop an algorithm to predict top persuaders using the estimated persuasion probabilities, and analyze the theoretical property of the algorithm. We conduct an extensive evaluation with real-world social network data and show that our method substantially outperforms prevalent methods from representative previous research and salient industry practices.","Data-driven method; Entity similarity; Influential user; Machine learning; Social influence; Social network; Social persuasion; Structural equivalence; Top persuader","Forecasting; Learning systems; Probability; Social networking (online); Data-driven methods; Entity similarities; Influential users; Social influence; Social persuasion; Structural equivalence; Top persuader; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041191357

Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a decision-making model by integrating ""soft computation"" using neighborhood rough set theory, fuzzy cluster means, and cumulative prospect theory. Literature is used to identify various factors for the decision environment. An illustrative problem provides insights into the methodology and application. Findings - The results indicate that green products can be evaluated from both their relative environmental burdens and benefits. Sustainable consumption and production factors that play a role in this multifactor decision are identified. The results show that a comprehensive evaluation can capture an effective overall picture on which green product(s) to delete. Research limitations/implications - The opaqueness of the proposed methodology may cause less acceptance by management. The methodology made a number of assumptions related to the data. An actual application of the tool rather than just an illustrative example is needed. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the novel integration of supply chain perspectives, both upstream (supply and production) and downstream (demand/usage), with green product deletion decision making. The hybrid multistage technique has advantages of being able to incorporate many factors that have a variety of quantitative and qualitative characteristics to help managers address green product deletion issues as well as its impact on greening of supply chains and organizational environmental sustainability.

We argue that the cohesion of exploratory or exploitative networks has an inverted U-shaped effect on the addition of new partners in the same activity-based network, and a positive effect on the addition of new partners in the other network. Results based on data from the biotechnology industry largely support our predictions with one exception. Our study contributes to both scholarly understanding of network embeddedness and alliance practice. Managerial Summary: The structure of firms’ ongoing alliance networks may have paradoxical implications for their efforts to search for and form alliance with new partners. That is, when a firm’s alliance partners are tightly connected with each other, the cohesive network tends to both encourage and impede the focal firm to add new partners. We resolve this dilemma by showing that when a firm is deeply entrenched in a cohesive alliance network conducting a certain type of activities (e.g., R&D activities), it may not easily add new R&D alliance partners. However, it may still be able to escape from the cohesive R&D alliance network by seeking new partners conducting other activities (e.g., manufacturing activities).

Likewise, Eurostat 2020 aims to increase investment in Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) to bypass the competitors, Japan and the U.S. As the result, investigating the determinants of robust knowledge economy is a continuing concern between city scholars, planners and leaders. To date, several locational and non-locational factors have been found to be influential. For instance, transit service, walkable street networks and dense neighborhoods that provide walkable access to urban amenities are the location preferences for the creative class. Creative class, in turn, attracts KIBS, and produces innovation which are all contributive to the knowldge-based economic vitality. While such trend is widely supported by the theoretical efforts, there is little empirical evidence on these complex multidimensional relationships and hence this study seeks to investigate both direct and indirect impacts of transit and walking amenities on the robust local knowledge economy. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we developed a comprehensive model that accounts for KIBS, creative economy and innovation productivity and investigates their locational and non-locational determinants with the particular focus on walking and transit amenities. Our results generally echo the findings of previous studies about the key role of industry clustering, place quality amenities, diversity and tolerance on the three drivers of robust local knowledge economy. We found that among all exogenous variables racial diversity and industry clustering have the most significant direct effect on innovation productivity. We also found that transit service quality and walkability contribute to a robust local knowledge economy through KIBS and creative class, but they have an adverse relationship to the innovation production of the STEM small firms. This might be due to the fact that walkability and transit access increase the property values and, therefore, make them unaffordable for small innovative firms. Our findings on the impacts of walkability and transit access on innovation productivity in vulnerable small firms call for attention to the equity aspects of innovation-supportive urban developments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Creative industries; Innovation; KIBS; Knowledge economy; Transit; Walkability","amenity; creative industry; innovation; knowledge economy; neighborhood; numerical model; traditional knowledge; urban development; walking; Japan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046723054

Information and communication technologies have advanced and given their important spillovers to other economic sectors. Sociocultural view of globalization posits that cultural values across the world are continuously changing. From the theoretical lens of technological determinism theory, technology of a society determines the development of its social structure and cultural values. Drawing on the sociocultural aspect of globalization and technological determinism theory, this study investigates the relationship between technology and national cultural values. Using secondary national-level data such as United Nations’ E-Government Survey and Global Innovation Index, we validate the proposed relationships. The results of the study indicate that technology is an important driver of cultural convergence pushing national cultures across the globe to converge toward two cultural values suggested by Hofstede: higher individualism and lower power distance. This study also finds that technology increases national confidence in financial markets through creation of increased transparency.

Using the notion of distinct business models and trade-offs as our theoretical lens, the purpose of this study was to: (1) Distinguish lean and agile firms based upon production methods; and (2) Compare lean and agile levels of external flexibility (EF) and supply chain flexibility (SCF). Data was obtained from 140 automotive firms in the Midlands (UK) via a survey which was sent by emails. Findings supported the theoretical notion of trade-offs, as firms implementing agile production methods were found to be more flexible in comparison with firms implementing lean production methods. More importantly, the agile firms that possessed high EF levels and SCF levels were predominantly positioned at the lower end of the automotive supply chain, whereas the lean firms were largely found to be operating at the top of the supply chain. First, we provide an innovative way in which lean and agile firms can be conceptualised. Second, as flexibility levels were assessed on actual numerical values, as opposed to using opinion based Likert Scale questions, a methodological contribution is made. Third, as flexibility is in its infancy stage of theoretical development we make an empirical contribution by developing a taxonomy that distinguishes each production concept. Finally, given the supply chain position to where lean and agile firms were found, we invoked a power perspective better understand this phenomenon. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agile; automotive; business models; flexibility; lean; power; trade-offs","Automotive industry; Binary alloys; Commerce; Supply chains; agile; automotive; Business models; flexibility; lean; power; Trade off; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046429897

In response, a nonfocal firm can adapt its marketing strategy in consideration of these two opposing effects. Because social media is a flexible medium through which firms can quickly adjust marketing strategies in response to such unexpected events, we study how nonfocal firms adjust their post-crisis social media efforts to induce purchases and to improve customer relationships-two strategies known in the literature as offensive and defensive marketing, respectively. In particular, we use the daily social media activities of 56 major airlines on Twitter around the time of the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash to study how nonfocal airlines ran offensive and defensive marketing on social media before and after the crisis. We find that, on average, nonfocal airlines increased their defensive marketing efforts but decreased their offensive marketing efforts after the crash, which we attribute to the negative spillover effect. However, the strategic adjustment of decreasing offensive marketing is attenuated by the competition between nonfocal airlines and the focal one, whichwe attribute to the moderating role of the competitive effect. These results are shown to be robust in various tests and reveal how the interplay of the two effects of a product-harm crisis on nonfocal firms shapes their postcrisis social media strategies. © 2018 INFORMS.","Defensive marketing; Offensive marketing; Product-harm crisis; Social media","Aircraft accidents; Commerce; Public relations; Sales; Strategic planning; Competitive effects; Customer relationships; Marketing IS; Marketing strategy; Product-harm crisis; Social media; Spillover effects; Unexpected events; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048670221

Specifically, we hypothesize that the positive relations between bottom-up initiative/employee diversity and opportunity formation are positively (negatively) moderated by such direct involvement by senior management. We examine these ideas using two matched data sources: a double-respondent survey of CEOs and HR managers and employer–employee register data. We find support for the view that senior management involvement positively moderates the relations between bottom-up processes/diversity and opportunity formation. Managerial Summary: What are the processes through which entrepreneurial opportunities emerge in established companies? Research has pointed to diversity and bottom-up initiative, but our understanding is limited with respect to what senior managers should do to optimally promote entrepreneurship in such companies. In one view, senior management should keep a distance and limit their involvement to picking the best opportunities out of those they are presented with in the bottom-up process. In contrast, we argue that given bottom-up initiative in the context of a diverse workforce, senior management should play a more direct role in the entrepreneurial process. The reason is that senior-management involvement at early stages of the opportunity formation process is required to handle the management challenges arising from diversity and bottom-up initiative. Overall, our study suggests that firms that wish to seize the potential benefits (in terms of entrepreneurial opportunities) of having a more diverse workforce and more bottom-up initiative need senior managers that directly engage in the entrepreneurial process.

We investigate how the composition of patenting teams relates to both the scope of their patent applications and the speed with which their patents are approved, by examining the main effects of team members’ intra-organizational diversity (based on affiliations with formal organizational units and informal organizational communities) and the moderating effects of team leader experience. We test our moderated mediation model in a sample of 121 teams that filed patents in a Fortune 50 company's India R&D center between 2005 and 2015, using proprietary employee data combined with newly released micro-data from the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Our findings illuminate the micro-foundations of innovation in firms by highlighting a trade-off between organizing patenting activity to maximize scope versus speed. Managerial Summary: Patenting is an important strategic tool that firms can use to protect and create value from their innovations. A firm can benefit from filing a patent application that gives it a wider possible set of claims related to an innovation. It can also benefit from faster approval of a patent application by the Patent Office. However, our study shows that there is a trade-off between patent application scope and patent approval speed, which creates tensions for the organization of patenting activities inside firms. In particular, we find that the diversity of a patenting team is positively related to patent scope but negatively related to patenting speed, and that these relationships vary with the experience of the team leader.

To address this gap in the literature, the case study empirically investigates a company that attempted to apply a pay-per-use model to sustainable transportation, based on its success in the telecommunications industry. Information collected from the interviews and from secondary external data is used to juxtapose between the industries. The Cambridge business model innovation process provides a framework to analyze the company's development stages. Results indicate that the company didn't succeed to bridge the design-implementation gap because it failed to acknowledge key marketing differences between industries. While cross-industry innovation offers entrepreneurial opportunities, organizations should consider the constraints imposed by the scale of investment required to build supportive infrastructure before emulating servitized business models. The study concludes with implications which may provide useful lessons to other sustainable transportation projects in-progress, such as Tesla and Riversimple, in terms of business model, technology, and prospects for commercialization.

We examine the electric bicycle (e-bike) sector in China to understand the future prospects for urban mobility and the interaction of e-bikes as a form of vernacular technology within the existing transport regime. For this purpose, we address the following questions: 1) What factors will influence the future adoption of e-bikes? 2) How are alternative travel modes evaluated against e-bikes? 3) Will e-bikes become a popular sustainable mobility mode in the future or only an intermediary mode to cars? To provide answers, we conducted a survey in Nanjing city in order to assess the attitude of e-bike users, and other mode users (e.g. pedestrians; bicycle users). We then analyse responses from this survey through the lens of sociotechnical transitions theory, notably the “Multi-Level Perspective” notions of niches, regimes, and landscape. The paper explores the influential factors underpinning future e-bike adoption and the decision-making calculus behind alternative mode choices. Generalised Linear Models are used to investigate the factors influencing future e-bike adoption and alternative mode choices based on the survey data. We conclude that e-bikes are an intermediary mode on Nanjing's motorisation pathway, and that they therefore may eventually reflect a dying regime. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Bicycles; China; Electrification; Modal choice; Sustainable mobility; Urban transport","Calculations; Decision making; Electric vehicles; Sporting goods; Surveys; Urban transportation; China; Electrification; Modal choice; Sustainable mobility; Urban transport; Bicycles; cycle transport; electric vehicle; future prospect; mobility; sustainable development; transportation mode; transportation planning; transportation system; urban transport; China; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044001002

We investigate what will happen when prospect theory (e.g., reference prices) meets consumer choice models from the perspectives of both the consumers and the firm. Academic/practical relevance: Consumers see multiple relevant products on a particular purchase occasion and often compare their prices to form the willingness to pay when considering whether to purchase a particular product. Reference prices, which are not included in many choice models, may impact consumer choice behavior, so we incorporate reference prices into consumer choice models and investigate the operations management problems. Methodology:We take the widely used multinomial logit model as a showcase to examine the effects of reference prices through analytical and empirical study.We consider the optimization problems on assortment planning and pricing under consumer choice models with a variety of reference prices, including the lowest price and the assortment variety. Results: Our empirical study on a real data set demonstrates that incorporating reference prices into choice models can significantly improve goodness of fit and prediction accuracy of consumer choice behavior. Moreover, we characterize the optimal policies for the assortment planning and pricing problems under the consumer choice models with various reference prices. In particular, for the pricing problems under the reference prices defined by either the lowest price or assortment variety, we show that the optimal pricing policy has the following structure: products can be divided into several groups based on their costs; the products in the same group charge either the same markup or the same price. Managerial implications: In practice, reference prices should be taken into account in model estimation and operations management. Ignoring reference prices may lead to substantial losses.

We find that for sectors other than the most cooperation-intensive outliers, the main determinants of university-industry collaboration are size, extramural R&D, and product innovativeness. Extramural R&D appears as the dominant determinant and seems to occur at the expense of intramural R&D, suggesting a substitution effect.

In an industry regulated by carbon tax policy, we consider two competing firms who sell ordinary products and green products respectively. In order to promote the firm who sells ordinary product to reduce carbon emissions, the government of China imposes carbon tax on the ordinary products. For the government, three objectives are considered when it makes carbon tax policy. They are increasing the government revenue, reducing the government expenditure and decreasing the carbon emissions. For the firms, it is important to explore their pricing strategies taken into account of the government tax policy. To find an optimal carbon tax rate and to achieve the three objectives simultaneously, we consider this as a multiple criteria decision-making problem. Hence, we propose to use a centralized data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to solve it. We find that when one firm produces ordinary products and the other produces green products, the government may set a high tax rate. While when both firms sell ordinary products, the optimal tax policy for each firm is different and the government may impose a higher tax rate for one firm and a lower tax rate for the other firm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Carbon tax policy; Centralized DEA approach; Government expenditure; Government revenue","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; Centralized DEA approach; Competing firms; Economic development; Government expenditure; Multiple criteria decision-making problems; Pricing strategy; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038871478

Previous studies focus extensively on decision support systems (DSSs) to automate complaint handling, while few addresses the issue of classification imprecision when inaccurate or inconsistent information exists in customer complaint narratives. This research presents a novel DSS for handling customer complaints and develops an evidential reasoning (ER) rule-based classifier as the core component of the system to classify customer complaints with uncertain information. More specifically, textual and numeric features are firstly combined to generate evidence for formulating the relationship between customer complaint features and classification results. The ER rule is then applied to combine multiple pieces of evidence and classify customer complaints into different categories with probabilities. An empirical study is conducted in a telecommunication company. Results show that the proposed ER rule-based classification model provides high performance in comparison with other machine learning algorithms.

Public sector organisations are also following this occurrence but with slower signs. Despite a relevant amount of research work on sustainability practices implemented by private organisations and by some public agencies, central public sectors have been left out of the scope of these studies. The main goal of this research is to identify the sustainability profile (including adopted policies and practices) of the public organisations, using the Portuguese Central Public Administration as a case study. A questionnaire survey was developed and submitted to Portuguese public sector organisations that fulfilled the following criteria: (i) to belong to the Portuguese Central Public Administration and (ii) to have the major area of activity at the national level. The statistical population was also defined on the basis of these criteria. Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis were used to explore the results in the organisations surveyed. The overall results demonstrate a low adoption level of integrated sustainability policies and practices, despite the expected positive trends related with the mandatory social and economic practices.

This study explores disaggregate relationships among socio-economic/demographic (SED) traits, the built environment (BE), and VO. Many previous studies have assumed that the importance of SED and BE variables to VO is homogeneous across the population, and have focused on the direct and mediated effects of those variables on VO. Here, we aim to account for heterogeneity in the effects of BE and SED, allowing those effects on VO to be moderated as a function of attitudes. Specifically, we use Latent Class Modeling (LCM), which probabilistically segments the sample so as to be homogeneous within and heterogeneous across segments, with respect to the choice process. Applied to a sample of 2385 commuters in Northern California, LCM outperforms an ordinary multinomial logit model and a deterministic segmentation model. The LCM identifies two classes: an “auto-oriented” segment, for which household size and income have stronger influences on vehicle ownership (compared to the other segment); and an “urbanite” segment, for which the BE generally has a stronger influence. This study contributes to better understanding the heterogeneity of an important travel-related choice process, and offers an alternative explanation to residential self-selection for an attitude-related endogeneity bias. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Endogeneity bias; Latent class model; Self-selection; Success table; Taste heterogeneity; Vehicle ownership","Logistic regression; Endogeneity bias; Latent class model; Self-selection; Success table; Taste heterogeneities; Vehicle ownership; Vehicles; car ownership; demography; heterogeneity; numerical model; transportation; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048587563

Over time, economic history became more like economics in its use of econometrics and in the likelihood of scholars publishing in economics, as opposed to, say, economic history journals. But the pace of change was slower in economic history than in labor economics, another subfield of economics that underwent profound intellectual change in the 1950s and 1960s, and there was also a structural break evident for post-2000 Ph.D. cohorts. To account for these features of the data, I sketch a simple, overlapping generations model of the academic labor market in which junior scholars have to convince senior scholars of the merits of their work in order to gain tenure. I argue that the early cliometricians—most notably, Robert Fogel and Douglass North—conceived of a scholarly identity for economic history that kept the field distinct from economics proper in various ways, until after 2000 when their influence had waned. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Econometrics; Economic history; Economics; Integration; Labor economics; Overlapping generations; Scholarly identity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040945556

The desire for a more efficient and effective PRH delivery by PPPs increases the importance of the research into improving operation performance (OP). Based on an extensive literature review, this study proposed a conceptual indicator system consisting of four OP indicator packages and 23 OP indicators from the perspective of stakeholders' satisfaction. Moreover, a structured questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate different stakeholders' perceptions of the relative significance of individual indicators and their relationships. The survey results showed that 21 indicators were important. Furthermore, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine the hypothetical relationships among indicators, indicator packages, and OP. The analysis results indicated that housing allocation and recycling efficiency, project spatial distribution, living environment, and financial status of the project significantly contributed to the OP of PRH projects in PPPs. According to the results of the CFA and structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis, this study proposed the pathways to improve the OP of PRH project delivery by PPPs. Last, this study identified seven key operation performance indicators (KOPIs) through the cross analysis of mean values in the survey and factor loadings in the CFA of all 21 indicators. The indicators, indicator packages, OP, and their relationships can be further used to measure the OP and establish a pathway to improvement in the OP of PRH delivery by PPPs in China or in other countries and achieve the sustainable development of PRH projects. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); Operation performance (OP); Public rental housing; Public-private partnerships (PPPs); Questionnaire survey; Structural equation modeling (SEM)","Apartment houses; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Surveys; Sustainable development; Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA); Operation performance; Public private partnerships; Public rental housings; Questionnaire surveys; Structural equation modeling; Factor analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044841728

From the archival data recordings of the decision-making meetings of Program N, a national water transfer program, the meeting-based collaboration relationships of the decision makers were identified. Cox regression was employed to explore the effects of collaboration network dynamics on the time needed to reach a decision. The results suggest that stronger previous collaboration relationships and more centralized social capital distribution in decisions groups contribute to more timely decision-making. These findings substantiate social network theories in a real-world collaborative decision-making setting and reveal the facilitators of timely project decisions. The practical implication for project decision management is that the recruitment of a decision-making group should be based on not only the decision makers' technical expertise but also their collaboration network dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association","Collaboration network dynamics; Project decision speed; Project decision-making","Dynamics; Collaboration network; Collaborative decision making; Decision makers; Decision-making groups; Project decision; Project environment; Technical expertise; Water transfers; Decision making; decision making; project management; social capital; social network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044323179

Furthermore, production capability is investigated as a conditional effect on the relationship between environmental practices and environmental performance. Specifically, using a sample of approximately 450 globally located manufacturing plants, the Resource Based View (RBV), Practice Based View (PBV) and Institutional theory were utilized to develop and test a set of hypotheses surrounding how economy influences the neoteric engagement of environmental practices. Data envelopment analysis was utilized to assign production capability scores to these manufacturing plants and then conditional process modeling was used to assess the relationships among type of economy, level of production capability, adoption of environmental practices and environmental performance. The study finds that there is a stronger positive relationship between developing economies and the neoteric adoption of environmental practices as compared to advanced economies. Results also show higher degrees of production capability had a mixed effect on the relationship between environmental practices and environmental performance. The results draw attention to how PBV and RBV may work together to inform how practices affect performance and how production capability reacts uniquely with environmental practices with different strategic foci.

Using a sample of 4953 digital start-ups the paper evaluates the impact of start-up founding teams’ higher education on the probability of securing equity investment and subsequent exit for investors. The main findings are: (1), teams with a founder that has a technical education are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and to exit, but the impact of technical education declines with higher level degrees, (2) teams with a founder that has doctoral level business education are less likely to remain self-financed and have a higher probability of securing equity investment, while undergraduate and postgraduate business education have no significant effect, and (3) teams with a founder that has an undergraduate general education (arts and humanities) are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and exit while postgraduate and doctoral general education have no significant effect on securing equity investment and exit. The findings enhance our understanding of factors that influence digital start-ups achieving equity milestones by showing the heterogeneous influence of different types of higher education, and therefore human capital, on new ventures achieving equity milestones.

However, in isolation, the indexes that these approaches generate fail to capture the multidimensional nature of bank branch efficiency. This paper develops a three-step procedure that enables combining the strengths of the existing approaches. We begin by taking the widest number of efficiency indexes proposed in literature (step 1), reduce the redundant information through a collinearity analysis (step 2), and categorize bank branches into efficiency classes through a clustering procedure (step 3). We test our approach on 23 branches of an Italian regional bank. The results show that this three-step approach is able to provide a multidimensional view of efficiency based on indexes employing a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches with different ways of conceiving (intermediation vs. production) and measuring (stock, vs. flow, or physical measures) bank outputs and inputs, different definitions of efficiency (technical and cost efficiency), and different measurement approaches (ratios, standard regression analysis and frontier functions). The resulting efficiency ranking is consistent with those that univariate indexes generate and provides a balanced evaluation of branch efficiency when such indexes produce contradictory indications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bank efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Multidimensional performance; OR in banking; Performance measurement systems","Data envelopment analysis; Regression analysis; Efficiency measurement; Methodological approach; Multi-dimensional approach; Multi-dimensional view; Multidimensional nature; Multidimensional performance; OR in banking; Performance measurement system; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032978743

In practice, a manufacturer commonly produces more than one product, or a portfolio of products, and provides warranty servicing for them. Many authors have attempted to optimise warranty policy to maximise the profit or minimise the cost of each individual product. Warranty claims of the products produced by the same manufacturer, however, may be due to common causes, since the products may be designed by the same engineer team or using the same type of components. This implies that the numbers of warranty claims of different products may be related, and optimisation of warranty policies for each individual product may therefore cause biased decisions. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper aims to collectively optimise a manufacturer's total profit for a portfolio of different products by using a mean-variance optimisation approach. A tool from the probability theory, copulas, is used to depict the dependence among the warranty claims of different products. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Mean-variance; Modern portfolio theory; Optimisation; Risk; Warranty","Manufacture; Numerical methods; Probability; Profitability; Risks; Mean variance; Modern portfolio theories; Optimisations; Probability theory; Total profits; Warranty; Warranty claims; Warranty policy; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034821592

We propose a novel modelling approach to support supply chain managers decide the optimal level of investment to improve quality performance under uncertainty. We develop a Poisson–Gamma model within a Bayesian framework, representing both the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in non-conformance rates. Estimates are obtained to value a supplier quality improvement activity and assess if it is worth gaining more information to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The theoretical properties of our model provide new insights about the relationship between the degree of epistemic uncertainty, the effectiveness of development programmes, and the levels of investment. We find that the optimal level of investment does not have a monotonic relationship with the rate of effectiveness. If investment is deferred until epistemic uncertainty is removed then the expected optimal investment monotonically decreases as prior variance increases but only if the prior mean is above a critical threshold. We develop methods to facilitate practical application of the model to industrial decisions by a) enabling use of the model with typical data available to major companies and b) developing computationally efficient approximations that can be implemented easily. Application to a real industry context illustrates the use of the model to support practical planning decisions to learn more about supplier quality and to invest in improving supplier capability. © 2017 The Authors","Decision analysis; Manufacturing; Risk analysis; Supply chain management; Uncertainty modelling","Decision making; Decision theory; Investments; Manufacture; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Supply chain management; Aleatory uncertainty; Computationally efficient; Development programmes; Epistemic uncertainties; Quality improvement; Supplier development; Uncertainty modelling; Value of information; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020627621

In addition to the complex intraday, intraweek and intrayear seasonal cycles, call arrival data typically contain a large number of anomalous days, driven by the occurrence of holidays, special events, promotional activities and system failures. This study evaluates the use of a variety of univariate time series forecasting methods for forecasting intraday call arrivals in the presence of such outliers. Apart from established, statistical methods, we consider artificial neural networks (ANNs). Based on the modelling flexibility of the latter, we introduce and evaluate different methods to encode the outlying periods. Using intraday arrival series from a call centre operated by one of Europe's leading entertainment companies, we provide new insights on the impact of outliers on the performance of established forecasting methods. Results show that ANNs forecast call centre data accurately, and are capable of modelling complex outliers using relatively simple outlier modelling approaches. We argue that the relative complexity of ANNs over standard statistical models is offset by the simplicity of coding multiple and unknown effects during outlying periods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Call centre arrivals; Functional data; Neural networks; Outliers; Time series forecasting","Complex networks; Neural networks; Statistics; Systems engineering; Time series; Call centres; Forecasting methods; Functional datas; Outliers; Promotional activities; Relative complexity; Time series forecasting; Univariate time series; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994274873

Balancing human and material resources during these situations is not a trivial issue, and that is further complicated by the participation of several actors at multiple periods. However, there is an absence of articles considering the importance of deploying only the required organisations for response activities depending on the conditions and the stage of the disaster. This research proposes a dynamic model to support disaster response which incorporates human and material resources from multiple organisations. The multi-modal, multi-commodity optimisation model supports resource allocation and relief distribution decisions through the maximisation of the level of service provided to disaster victims and the minimisation of cost. The model is the first dynamic formulation in the literature with the ability to optimise the number, type and stage of deployment of organisations required according to the circumstances of the emergency. The model has been applied to two major floods that have occurred in Mexico in recent years. Each case was tested using three different scenarios to investigate the ability of the model to handle different conditions. The results of both cases were compared to scenarios with independent participation from each organisation and an instance capturing the real decisions made by Mexican authorities. The results showed the inefficiency stemming from independent decision-making, an excess of actors involved in the real instances of both cases, the applicability of the model to different circumstances, and the value of the ability to modify the number of organisations involved per stage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Disaster response; Emergency logistics; Multiple objective programming; Resource allocation","Decision making; Resource allocation; Disaster response; Dynamic formulation; Emergency logistics; Level of Service; Material resources; Multiple objective programming; Optimisation models; Relief distribution; Emergency services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053104141

Therefore, SMEs need to start adopting more environmentally-friendly behaviors to ensure a better future for coming generations. SMEs have failed to do this until now – despite making a significant effort – in part because dealing with this issue is a quite subjective process and a variety of aspects need to be considered. The current study sought to address this problem through the integrated application of cognitive mapping and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Based on a constructivist approach, group sessions involving a panel of entrepreneurs and environmental experts created, tested, and validated a green index for SMEs that addresses two of the major limitations of current evaluation approaches. The first limitation is the manner in which evaluation criteria have been defined within the scope of SME environmental conduct assessments, while the second is the method with which these same criteria's weights – or trade-offs – are calculated. The proposed index produced promising results when used to identify the most environmentally-friendly SMEs in a sample of firms. These results can be used as benchmark data for environmental improvement initiatives, and the findings confirm that the methodologies underlying the proposed model-building process facilitate a clearer understanding of how to evaluate SMEs' pro-environmental behaviors. The advantages and limitations of the proposed index are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive map; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Green index; Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA); SME environmental conduct; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Cognitive systems; Economic and social effects; Operations research; Sustainable development; Cognitive maps; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Green indices; Multiple criteria decision analysis; SME environmental conduct; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048702282

Therefore, our research objective is to propose a new approach to conduct competitive environment analysis for a global operations strategy in retailing, by examining relationships between discretionary inputs of the supply chain, nondiscretionary inputs of the environment, and performance of retailing. We develop a nondiscretionary data envelopment analysis model to assess performance in retailing and integrate it with econometric analysis. Using multisource data of 124 organizations in the global retailing industry, it is interesting to find: while nondiscretionary factors significantly influence the operational performance of global retailers, firms in an environment with a higher market concentration, larger consumer spending per capita, and smaller inhabitants’ population are more likely to achieve a higher operational efficiency in retailing. Another interesting finding with practical implication is: inputs relevant to outside environment (e.g., suppliers in upstream and outlets in downstream supply chain) can influence operational efficiency more than inputs in internal supply chain (e.g., warehouses). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Competitive environment analysis; Data envelopment analysis; Global operations strategy; Multi-method approach; Operational performance","Efficiency; Industrial research; Population statistics; Supply chains; Competitive environment; Data envelopment analysis models; Global operations; Industrial environments; Multi-method approach; Operational efficiencies; Operational performance; Operations strategies; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048309118

To achieve this goal, the study develops a theoretical model based on the neoclassical theory of the firm that links energy efficiency to bank sector development, and a unique bank-based data by Andrianova et al. (2015) for 43 Sub-Saharan African countries from 1998 to 2012. The principal component analysis is used to derive a composite bank-based development index from different bank balance sheet performance indicators- return on asset, asset quality, bank capitalization, managerial inefficiency and financial stability. The two-stage system generalized method of moment (Sys-GMM) technique was used. The results reveal that, both in the short- and long-run, improved banking performance fosters energy efficiency improvements in sub-Saharan Africa, but this is compromised by democracy (institutional quality). Thus, to achieve energy efficiency improvements, specific initiatives should be implemented to boost the development of the banking sector while also ensuring that democratic governance in the sub-region weans itself off things that impede the progress of the real sector. More ambitiously, creating a Green Bank may be necessary to stimulate energy efficiency investments in the sub-region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Banking performance; Energy intensity; Political institution; Sub-Sahara Africa; System GMM","Efficiency; Energy conservation; Investments; Method of moments; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Banking performance; Energy intensity; Political institutions; Sub-Sahara Africa; System GMM; Energy efficiency; banking; energy efficiency; investment location; performance assessment; political participation; principal component analysis; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051129160

We distinguish between upstream and downstream relational capital and theorize that higher levels of specialization will buffer against decreases in upstream relational capital, because of deeper domain expertise and stronger downstream relational capital. Conversely, higher levels of generalization permit greater gains from increases in upstream relational capital, due to leverage across a more diversified downstream portfolio of activities. We test and find support for these hypotheses in the context of the US lobbying industry. Our study contributes to the strategic human capital literature by isolating the dimension of specialization and relational capital embodied within individuals and providing performance implications of the interactions. Managerial Summary: Both “what you know” and “whom you know” impacts performance. Generalists and specialists are different on the “what you know” dimension. On the “who you know” dimension, we distinguish between upstream (supplier) and downstream (client) relationships. We show that specialists are buffered by deeper downstream relations from performance declines when their powerful upstream connections lose power. Generalists benefit from broader networks when their upstream connections gain power. Thus, when the value of their relationships change, specialists and generalists should each assess when they can reap performance benefits, and when they need to bolster against adversities. For firms, our study suggests hiring the right mix of specialists and generalists is important to reduce risks from relational losses while enjoying the performance benefits from relational gains.

An increasingly popular policy is to require that foreign companies provide public goods near the communities where their commercial investments are sited. This approach seeks to crowd in additional investments, create clusters of interconnected firms, and set in motion economic agglomeration processes. Post-2006 Liberia represents an ideal empirical setting to test the effectiveness of this approach. We construct a new dataset that measures the precise locations of 557 natural resource concessions granted to investors. We then merge these data with a remotely sensed measure of nighttime light growth at the 1 km × 1 km grid cell level and analyze it using a matched difference-in-differences strategy. We find heterogeneous treatment effects across sectors and investor types: mining (specifically iron-ore) investments projects have positive growth effects, while agriculture and forestry investment projects do not; furthermore, concessions granted to Chinese investors have positive growth effects while those given to U.S. investors do not. These patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects across sectors and investor types are consistent with the theory of change underpinning the government's development corridor strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth; FDI; Geo-referenced data; Liberia; Public goods","agglomeration; economic growth; foreign direct investment; natural resource; policy approach; public goods; state role; Liberia [West Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044072738

The purpose of this paper is to examine the understanding of using safety climate and to make explicit some of the main elements that have a greater impact in the construction industry in Oman. Relevant safety climate factors from literature have been identified using specific search criteria, which resulted in 62 factors spanning over a period of 37 years from 1980 to 2017. The results of face-to-face interviews with construction professionals from chosen construction companies in Oman that show a high level of safety performance are also presented. The result shows that management commitment; alignment and integration of safety as a value; accountability across the board; supervisory management; empowerment and involvement of workers; improvement of communication; and training and education are some of the main elements that significantly affect safety climate in Oman. The common safety climate factors reported in this research are based on the views of selected interviewees working in the construction industry in Oman. It is suggested that these factors may be validated further considering views of other members of the construction team, before being used for safety climate assessment. © 2018 ICE Publishing.

This paper examines the differing productivity growth paths of some 85 British cities since the beginning of the 1970s, and explores how far these paths reflect differences across cities in the pace and nature of structural change. We find that while northern cities led productivity growth over 1971-91 southern cities then led after 1991. However, at the same time, the rate of productivity growth slowed across almost all cities between these two periods. We find evidence of considerable structural convergence across cities and a general tendency for the degree of specialisation to fall. This then leads to a decomposition analysis which identifies the relative contribution of between-sector (structural change) and within-sector effects to city productivity growth. The analysis reveals that structural change - and especially the shift from manufacturing to services - has had a negative impact on productivity growth across all cities, but that within-sector productivity developments while positive and outweighing structural change effects, have also declined over the past 45 years, as well as varying across cities. These findings point to the need for further research on the causes of this slowdown in 'within-sector 'productivity growth and why those causes appear to differ from city to city. They also point to the need for a 'place-based' dimension to policies aimed at improving national productivity performance. © The Author(s) (2018). Published by Oxford University Press.

The work presented here sought a remote, vulnerable island context (Fiji, South Pacific) to enable further insight into the innovation process related to resilience and sustainability. The innovation targeted by this work was off-grid solar renewable energy (RE) systems framed as a development instrument to promote local, community-based resilience to climate change through increased livelihood security and reduction of climate change effects. Applying a local-level resilience framework to solar technology use, we conclude that the RE system can improve resilience, however, unintended consequences included a rush for energy usage causing a “tragedy of commons” of finite stored energy and subsequently increased supplementary fossil fuel use. This suggests that there are still missed resilience opportunities in the way that the innovation is implemented in developing countries and remote areas in particular. Further analysis demonstrated that improved planning at the socio-technological interface has the potential to strengthen communities’ resilience. With significant RE investments required for a transition to a low-carbon future in many developing countries, there is a pressing need to effectively introduce innovative uses of technologies. Existential threats to many local communities, and some nations in the Pacific may mean that sub-optimal innovation will not be enough. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Innovation; Pacific island countries; Renewable energy; Resilience; Vulnerable communities","Developing countries; Fossil fuels; Investments; Sustainable development; Innovation process; Innovative technology; Low-carbon futures; Pacific islands; Renewable energies; Resilience; Unintended consequences; Vulnerable communities; Climate change; alternative energy; climate change; developing world; innovation; investment; solar power; sustainability; Fiji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044371275

We code the contents of the respondents’ self-reported reasons for driving (i.e. the instrumental rationalities attributed to driving with respect to varying purposes) to identify keywords representing motivation to drive; we then analyse the keyword data using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Study 2 examines how the dimensions discovered through study 1 relate to propensity to carpool, using structural equation modelling (SEM). Data for Study 2 are the survey responses of commuters (N = 1028) based in the United States. The MDS reveals four key dimensions of motivation to drive. These capture instrumental rationalities for driving within four situational domains which we term: (1) Family; (2) Public transport impractical changes; (3) Rigid schedule; and (4) Non-urban areas. The SEM results show that the regression coefficients on propensity to carpool of Public transport impractical changes and Rigid schedule are significant and negative; the Family domain has a positive but non-significant regression coefficient. Regarding demographics, men's mean values on all four domain variables are significantly higher than those for women, except for the Family domain where the mean value for women is higher; meanwhile, age predicts decreasing propensity to carpool. Additionally, the situational domains of Public transport impractical changes, Rigid schedule and Non-urban areas significantly positively correlate. Consequently, overall, the results imply that addressing commuters’ instrumental rationalities for driving, namely increasing schedule flexibility and providing more direct or quicker public transport, could indirectly encourage commuters to carpool. The study makes an original contribution by estimating the causal relationship between commuters’ motivation to drive and propensity to carpool. © 2018","Carpooling; Commuting; Motivations to drive; Multidimensional scaling; Propensity to carpool; Structural equation modelling","Motivation; Urban transportation; Carpooling; Commuting; Multi-dimensional scaling; Propensity to carpool; Structural equation modelling; Digital storage; commuting; equation; numerical model; public transport; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042654329

Design/methodology/approach: Using a convergent parallel (concurrent) mixed method approach, data were collected from 28 stakeholders involved with HPPP projects in Tanzania using a hand-delivered and e-mail survey and 13 semi-structured interviews with public and private sector respondents. The quantitative data included subjecting the 19 challenges as identified from the literature to parametric tests such as one-sample t-tests and descriptive statistics tests such as measures of central tendencies and frequency analysis through Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 22.0). Qualitative data employed content analysis. The research was further underpinned by a number of theoretical perspectives such as Gidden’s structuration theory, contingency theory, relational and equity theory. Findings: The top five ranked challenges influencing the delivery of HPPP were “inadequate PPP skills and knowledge”; “poor contracting and tendering documents”; “inadequate project management”; “inadequate legal framework”; and “misinformation on financial capacity of private partners”. The least six ranked and most significant challenges based on the one-sample (single) t-tests were as follows: “Poor risk allocation”; “inexperienced private partner”; “unequal qualification and contributions of expertise”; “poor enabling environment to attract competent partners”; “inadequate mechanisms for recovery of private investors’ capital”; and “high costs in procuring PPP projects”. The qualitative study further confirmed the challenges and cited the reason for the failure of joint venture projects as the lack of motivation for undertaking similar PPP projects. Despite the increased awareness of PPP projects and associated marginal benefits, the main impediment to the uptake and delivery of PPP housing projects remained the lack of skills and expertise. Research limitations/implications: The proposed framework model is not yet tested, but since this paper is part of the ongoing research, the next stage involves the testing and validation of the model. Future studies could test the applicability of the proposed framework in other HPPP projects in Tanzania, and in other similar developing countries. Second, the validated framework can contribute towards addressing similar challenges as well as providing guidance. The proposed framework model is not yet tested, but since this paper is part of the ongoing research, the next stage involves the testing and validation of the model. Furthermore, recommendation for future research is to test the alignment of the identified challenges to the proposed remedial solutions across the five phases within the proposed PPP framework with a number of case studies. Practical implications: The identified challenges were used to form the basis of the framework presented in this paper. Furthermore, these provide useful information, thus leading to increased awareness to enable successful delivery of HPPP in Tanzania. Similarly, both the government and policy makers could use the findings as the basis for re-examining the existing PPP policy and regulations, and reflecting on the existing situation with a view to improving the delivery of future HPPP projects. Originality/value: The empirical study is among the first that identifies and ranks the challenges of PPP for housing projects delivery within the Tanzanian context. The identification of the challenges enabled their ranking, resulting in the mapping out of the most critical challenges. Furthermore, using the Gidden’s structuration theory, the study illustrates how institution mechanisms (structures) address these delivery challenges, thus influencing the implementation of HPPP in Tanzania, and how individual stakeholders (human agents or agency) are able to make choices (advocated solutions) in dealing with the challenges. More so, these constraints (challenges) as identified and viewed through the contingency and equity theoretical lenses form the foundation for developing the PPP conceptual framework. The proposed framework would thus serve as a mechanism for providing practical solutions as well as reducing the level of severity of the identified challenges. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","International practice; Project management; Questionnaire survey","Developing countries; Housing; Laws and legislation; Privatization; Project management; Testing; Descriptive statistics; Design/methodology/approach; International practice; Joint venture projects; Public and private sector; Public private partnerships; Questionnaire surveys; Semi structured interviews; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047340402

Using data from scientific stock assessments and a statistical model for other fish stocks the past and present status, and the potential catch, abundance and profit for 4713 fish stocks constituting 78% of global fisheries are estimated. Three major scenarios of future trends are considered; business as usual (BAU) in which largely unmanaged fisheries move towards bioeconomic equilibrium but where well-managed fisheries maintain their management, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in which fisheries are managed to maximize yield, and fisheries reform (REF) where the competitive race to fish is eliminated and fisheries are managed to maximize profit. The future prospects differ greatly based on region of the world and product type. This analysis forecasts that yield in major tuna and forage fish species will remain roughly the same as current levels under all three scenarios, while there does appear to be potential for increased yield of whitefish. There is considerable room for increased profit in most of these fisheries from better management. Increased yield will come from rebuilding overexploited stocks, reducing fishing mortality on stocks that are still abundant but fished at high rates, and surprisingly from fishing some stocks harder.

In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, compressor modelling to predict the engine airflow and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy/exergy flows and the engine components exergy destruction. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports or automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closer monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy and exergy analyses; Energy management; Quantification of measurements quality; Ship propulsion engine; Statistical analysis; Systematic methodology","Benchmarking; Cooling water; Data acquisition; Decision making; Energy conservation; Energy management; Environmental impact; Exergy; Gases; Marine engines; Monitoring; Quality control; Ships; Statistical methods; Automated monitoring systems; Automatic data acquisition; Energy and exergy analysis; Key performance indicators; Monitoring techniques; Propulsion engine; Systematic methodology; Very large crude carriers; Ship propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053446026

They provided a good platform to quantify the merger efficiency and related it to relevant organisational changes ex-ante. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach to decompose the potential overall gains from mergers into to technical effect, size effect, and harmony effect. The proposed approach uses strongly efficient projections, and consistently calculates radial input-based measures for these three effects based on the pre-merger aggregated inputs. In addition, the proposed approach is of vital significance in two special cases where the aggregated projected inputs are not proportional to the pre-merger aggregated inputs and where the production sizes are very different for the original decision-making units. Finally, an application to the City Commercial Banks (CCBs) in China is provided to illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the proposed approach. The application shows that there exist significant merger efficiency gains for these top 20 CCBs. Further, both the technical effect and harmony effect favour mergers, whereas the size effect would work against most mergers. Thus, in most cases the full-size merger with “organisational sense” is not proper. © 2018, © Operational Research Society 2018.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); decomposition; merger efficiency","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Decomposition; Efficiency; City commercial banks; Decision making unit; Efficiency gain; Ex antes; Organisational; Organisational change; Production economics; Size effects; Merging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042480423

The prevailing practice of fulfilling product families is to postpone certain customization modules in the downstream supply chain. Product platforming and postponement decisions are inherently coupled in terms of developing a modular product architecture to leverage product variety and the supply chain. This paper is motivated towards integrated decision making underlying modular product platforming (MPP) with supply chain postponement (SCP). The paper formulates integrated MPP and SCP decisions as a Stackelberg game that entails joint optimization for interactive evaluation of product modularity and supply chain fulfillment costs. A bilevel mixed 0–1 programming model is developed to characterize the leader-follower decision making process. Virtual compound modules are introduced to justifying which modules should be postponed. An upper level optimization problem is established for identification of basic modules and compound modules by maximizing customer-perceived utilities and postponement utilities of product families, whereas a lower level optimization problem deals with the selection of most appropriate postponement service providers for a minimal total supply chain cost. A nested genetic algorithm is developed to solve the bilevel joint optimization model. A case study of laser printer product platforming and supply chain postponement is reported to illustrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed decision model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bilevel programming.; Postponement; Product architect; Product platform; Supply chain configuration","Costs; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Bi-level programming; Postponement; Product architect; Product platforms; Supply chain configuration; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054847860

While managing prominent strategic suppliers in the top tier is well understood, we have only just begun to recognize a different type of critical suppliers called nexus suppliers. Nexus suppliers are critical because of their structural positions in the supply network. They can be several tiers removed in the extended supply network and hence may not have direct contact with, and not be visible to, the focal buying firm. In this study, we explore the identification and categorization of nexus suppliers. Based on the theory of nexus supplier and data envelopment analysis (DEA), we propose a data-analytics approach to compute what we call Nexus Supplier Index (NSI). It is a measure that combines various network centrality measures to capture and reflect different aspects of a supplier's structural importance. The contribution of our study is to take the concept of nexus suppliers that exists only in theory to practice and demonstrate how to look for nexus suppliers in the real world. To achieve this aim, we develop a mathematical model for NSI, compile a large data set using Bloomberg Terminal, and engage in computations to identify and categorize nexus suppliers. The target company is Honda, and we review the results with the top supply management team at Honda of America.

Based on Me, the expected value of fuzzy return and the lower absolute deviation are used to quantify the return and risk levels of a portfolio respectively.

Hence, this research integrates the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), institutional theory along with Human Organization Technology (HOT) fit model as the organization theories to explain the adoption of Hospital Information System (HIS). To examine the effects of inter and intra-organizational potential factors on HIS adoption, within the context of Malaysian public hospitals, a survey method using web-based questionnaire is employed. The role of hospital size in this study is investigated to determine its distinct moderating influence among the relationships of the HIS adoption and significant dimensional factors. The results indicated that system affiliation (p < 0.05), mimetic pressure-competitors (p < 0.1), normative pressure (p < 0.05), and employees’ IS knowledge (p < 0.05) were the most significant drivers for adopting HIS in the public hospitals of Malaysia. The results also showed that hospital size as the only moderator of this study has no significant effect on the other relationships in our developed theoretical model. In other words, the effects of the significant factors on HIS adoption are the same in three small, medium, and large Malaysian public hospitals.

The profusion of data generated through social media has proved to have the potential for improving the efficiency of existing traffic management systems and transportation analytics. This study complements existing literature by proposing a framework to evaluate transit riders’ opinion about quality of transit service using Twitter data. Although previous studies used keyword search to extract transit-related tweets, the extracted tweets can still be noisy and might not be relevant to transit quality of service at all. In this study, we leverage topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to sift tweets that are relevant to the actual user experience of the transit system. Sentiment analysis is further performed based on the tweet-per-topic index we developed, to gauge transit riders’ feedback and explore the underlying reasons causing their dissatisfaction on the service.

We hypothesize that queue configuration may affect servers' service rate through several mechanisms: Pooling may affect service rate directly as a result of social loafing effect and competition effect and indirectly via its impact on queue length. To investigate these impacts, we take advantage of the supermarket's checkout layout and use a data set containing both checkout transaction details and queue information collected from video recordings in the supermarket. After we control for the queue length, we find that servers in dedicated queues are about 10.7% faster than those in shared queues, mainly because of the social loafing effect. We also demonstrate that pooling has an indirect negative effect on service time through its impact on queue length. In addition, the queue configuration's direct effect and its indirect queue length effect function independently of each other. In aggregation, the social loafing effect dominates, and servers slow down (a 6.86% increase in service time) in shared queues. © 2017 INFORMS.","Empirical operations management; Pooling; Queueing; Server behavior; Social loafing in queues","Queueing theory; Retail stores; Video recording; Empirical operations managements; Pooling; Queueing; Server behavior; Social loafing; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049413595

For the first time, an experimental procedure is adopted to conduct a direct comparison between participatory and non-participatory decision-making in the context of heritage tourism planning. Contrary to previous work, this is the first ex-ante assessment of community participation at a destination with no such prior experience. The analysis relies on behavioural data on choices, deliberation and conflict studied in the context of a controlled collaborative environment. The findings suggest that choices and deliberation between participatory and non-participatory groups exhibit no statistically significant differences although participatory groups were more susceptible to conflict. However, interestingly, conflict was constructive as it increased provisions for heritage goods. Furthermore, intra-group heterogeneity did not always affect collective decisions negatively whereas trust and institutional credibility played a major role in influencing both individual and collective preferences. These findings have important implications for research and policy, opening a novel avenue for the systematic study of participation dynamics to inform the instigation of participatory endeavours. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community participation; experimental economics; Heritage tourism; voluntary contributions to public goods","decision making; experimental study; heritage tourism; local participation; tourism management; tourist destination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038008868

However, the construction industry is stressful, which may significantly affect CWs' performance and safety at work. It is possible to prevent CWs experiencing unmanageable stress and the associated negative consequences if the critical factors for managing their stress were known. Yet, very few studies have been conducted to explore these critical stress management factors for them. With consideration of their unique work characteristics and environment, the current study set out to fill this research gap through exploration of CWs' coping behaviors, stress symptoms, and performance. Focus group studies were conducted to collect qualitative data from skilled CWs, general CWs, and supervisors of CWs. The study explored 15 coping behaviors (categorized as either problem based or emotion based), 5 emotional and 11 physical stress symptoms, and 5 indicators of CWs' performance and safety. The principal findings include the following: CWs often not only experience physical stress symptoms, but also suffer from emotional stress symptoms; and unlike the managerial staffs, CWs usually adopt more emotion-based than problem-based coping behaviors (10 types and 5 types, respectively). A propositional model was proposed and validated by a short questionnaire survey study. Practical recommendations are made for promoting effective stress management and improving project management on CWs. The research limitations are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made. This paper is the first attempt to explore CWs' coping behaviors, specific stress symptoms, and performance, which forms a basis for a future large-scale study. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction workers; Focus group; Health; Performance; Safety; Stress","Accident prevention; Construction industry; Health; Human resource management; Project management; Stresses; Surveys; Construction projects; Construction workers; Focus group studies; Focus groups; Large-scale studies; Performance; Practical recommendation; Questionnaire surveys; Occupational risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043535925

The first effect can be understood as the re-assignment of offshore tasks to immigrant workers. The second can be seen as a cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as a trade-cost reducing effect. To test the empirical significance and size of these effects, we exploit differences in immigrant inflows across U.K. labor markets and a new firm-level dataset on U.K. service firms. We find that immigrants increase overall productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact on these firms. They also reduce the extent of country-specific offshoring, consistent with a reallocation of tasks, and they increase country-specific exports, consistent with a reduction in bilateral communication and trade costs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Immigration; Services trade","data set; export; immigration; import; labor migration; productivity; trade flow; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043476202

We use a two-sector Schumpeterian model of growth, in which a manufacturing sector produces the traditional consumption good and an agricultural sector produces food to sustain contemporaneous population. Agriculture demands land as an input, itself treated as a scarce form of capital. In our model both population and sectoral technological progress are endogenously determined, and key technological parameters of the model are structurally estimated using 1960-2010 data on world GDP, population, cropland and technological progress. Introducing random shocks to the evolution of total factor productivity in agriculture, we show that uncertainty optimally requires more land to be converted into agricultural use as a hedge against production shortages, and that it significantly affects both optimal consumption and population trajectories. © 2017 The Authors.","agricultural productivity; economic growth; endogenous innovations; environmental constraints; food security; global population; land conversion; stochastic control","agricultural development; agricultural land; agricultural production; economic growth; endogenous growth; food security; Gross Domestic Product; population growth; productivity; stochasticity; total factor productivity; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043242376

This study explores how changing levels of uncertainty and competition affect interfirm ties of entrepreneurial firms as markets transition from nascent to growth stage. Tracing six entrepreneurial game publishers during the growth stage of the U.S. wireless gaming market, the findings reveal that in a growth stage market, as uncertainty decreases, certain ties of entrepreneurial firms are terminated. First, existing partners may cut ties and become competitors after entering the market directly. This is a “winner's curse” as more successful firms are more likely to entice their partners to enter the market directly. Second, ties may be terminated as prominent firms that are “overwhelmed” with too many partners cut ties with low to mediocre performance, while their remaining partners enter a positive spiral of tie strength and performance. Finally, as uncertainty decreases, new firms may enter the market as competitors to prominent firms. While entrepreneurial firms with high- and low-performing ties to prominent partners may find ties with these new entrants attractive, those with mediocre ties to few prominent partners find this move too risky and wait for a first mover to legitimate it. Overall, the findings show that changing levels of uncertainty and competition in growth stage markets can have different consequences for firms due to heterogeneity in their ties and power relative to partners. The findings provide several contributions to literature regarding the relationship among interfirm ties, firm performance, and market evolution. Managerial Summary: Based on interviews at six entrepreneurial game publishers in the United States and their partners, this study shows how changing levels of uncertainty and competition in growing markets can have different consequences for firms based on the different types of alliances in their portfolio and their power relative to partners. The findings highlight the importance of managing partners differently based on alliance type and goal of the partner. They advocate remaining flexible in alliance management as information asymmetries, intentions and bargaining power of partners can change and lead to abrupt alliance dissolution. They show that alliance portfolio management goes beyond a firm's capability of managing individual alliances, and provide a tool for managers to evaluate their alliance portfolios and take the necessary precautions.

However, the majority of the nation's smallholders produce lentils on very small plots of land. The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil-producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per-hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs. The study finds that only very smallholder lentil farms (0.01-0.05 ha) benefit from CF. © 2018 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","contract farming; Lentil; low-value crop; Nepal; propensity score matching; treatment effect","contract farming; cost analysis; crop production; developing world; globalization; profitability; smallholder; yield response; Nepal; Lens culinaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050949752

The Palestinian Central Bureau of statistics (PCBS) performs periodic statistics regarding the average energy consumption of the households, but there is no up to date breakdown of the energy consumption in the residential sector. The Palestinian energy sector main challenges are the high fuel prices, lack of sustainable consumption and energy insecurity. Developing energy policies and studying the potential of shifting towards more independent and sustainable energy sources need a clear understanding of the current energy consumption. A survey was used to collect relevant quantitative and qualitative data. The total number of households in Hebron who responded to the survey was 322 households. The survey covered physical characteristics of the dwellings, socioeconomic features of the households in addition to the pattern of heating the spaces, quantity and type of fuel used for heating. On average the households heated only 9.2% of the total area of their houses during the winter days. The survey revealed that households spend 3.5%–21.6% of their monthly income on space heating during winter. The main contribution to knowledge of this paper is a regression model to estimate energy consumption based on the data collected from the survey. The regression model is developed with an R2 adjusted 0.606 indicating 60.6% accuracy of the predicted energy consumed for heating. The regression model depends on 14 parameters which include the type of settlement, physical characteristics of the dwelling that are housing typology, level of thermal insulation of the walls, the main building materials and the housing age. It also depends on socioeconomic parameters which are the family monthly income and the occupancy period. Moreover, the type of the heating system used, the number of heated months and the nominal heated area were influential parameters in this model.

In particular, it is widely believed that under adverse economic conditions, electorates and governments prioritize economic growth and jobs over costly ecological restraint. The empirical evidence for this received wisdom, however, remains surprisingly contradictory. We contribute to this debate by studying a case where the odds of the economy-environment trade-off claim holding true should be high: an emerging economy in severe recession, and environmental policy with high short-term costs and long-term benefits. Based on a representative survey (N = 2449) in Brazil, implemented in late 2015/early 2016, we examine how ego- and socio-tropic economic conditions, both perceived and real, affect citizens’ preferences concerning the mitigation of deforestation and climate change. We find no robust evidence for an economy-environment trade-off. The main policy implication is that, from a public opinion perspective, there is considerable room for ambitious environmental policy even under adverse economic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Climate mitigation; Deforestation; Economic recession; Representative survey","Climate change; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Public policy; Social aspects; Surveys; Brazil; Climate mitigations; Economic condition; Economic Recession; Emerging economies; Environmental policy; Mitigation of deforestations; Policy implications; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047525084

However, because a safety inspection for scaffolds is primarily visual and labor intensive, the OSHA standards related to scaffolds are frequently violated. Improper management of scaffolds has caused scaffolding collapses that have a potentially detrimental effect and liability on workers' lives. This paper discusses the significance of scaffolding collapses and explores a method to perform scaffolding monitoring. To establish an integrated method, this research cross-connects various components (e.g., strain data, finite element model (FEM)-based structural analysis, machine learning, and an actual scaffold) in the presented framework. More specifically, this framework for a smart monitoring system is involved with: (1) developing a wireless strain sensing module for data collection, (2) modeling an FEM and learning data for failure mechanisms through FEM to characterize scaffold behaviors under certain loading conditions, and (3) investigating a machine-learning algorithm (i.e., support vector machine) for decision making. The FEM simulation analyzes a scaffolding to calculate strain values for each scaffolding column from randomly generated 1,200 load cases. Load-related strain data form training and testing sets for the machine-learning algorithm that enables the distinguishing of scaffolding conditions such as safe, over-turning, uneven-settlement, and over-loading conditions. In the experimental validation, the developed wireless strain sensing modules perform the real-time strain measurement and the machine-learning algorithm to successfully estimate the status of the scaffolding structure with 97.66% accuracy on average. The proposed method could escalate a monitoring paradigm for temporary structures from a labor-intensive manual inspection to a systematic real-time approach. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Finite element model (FEM); Machine learning; Scaffold; Smart monitoring; Temporary structures","Artificial intelligence; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Decision making; Finite element method; Human resource management; Learning systems; Load testing; Machine components; Monitoring; Scaffolds; Construction activities; Experimental validations; Manual inspection; Safety inspections; Smart monitoring; Smart monitoring systems; Temporary structures; Training and testing; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048383850

However, this system is unlikely to be sustainable in the medium to long term. This study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of healthcare financing reform by examining households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a contributory national health insurance scheme. Methods: Using the contingent valuation method, a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1187 heads of household in Jeddah province over a 5-month period. Multi-stage sampling was employed to select the study sample. Using a double-bounded dichotomous choice with the follow-up elicitation method, respondents were asked to state their WTP for a hypothetical contributory national health insurance scheme. Tobit regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with WTP and assess the construct validity of elicited WTP. Results: Over two-thirds (69.6%) indicated that they were willing to participate in and pay for a contributory national health insurance scheme. The mean WTP was 50 Saudi Riyal (US$13.33) per household member per month. Tobit regression analysis showed that household size, satisfaction with the quality of public healthcare services, perceptions about financing healthcare, education and income were the main determinants of WTP. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a theoretically valid WTP for a contributory national health insurance scheme by Saudi people. The research shows that willingness to participate in and pay for a contributory national health insurance scheme depends on participant characteristics. Identifying and understanding the main influencing factors associated with WTP are important to help facilitate establishing and implementing the national health insurance scheme. The results could assist policy-makers to develop and set insurance premiums, thus providing an additional source of healthcare financing. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"adult; construct validity; contingent valuation; education; feasibility study; female; follow up; head; health care financing; household; human; human experiment; male; national health insurance; perception; questionnaire; regression analysis; sampling; satisfaction; Saudi Arabia; aged; consumer attitude; cross-sectional study; economics; financial management; middle aged; public health; Saudi Arabia; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Aged; Consumer Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Financing, Personal; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Saudi Arabia; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040088902

We compare two organizations from two different industries to understand how different types of data resources can provide a competitive advantage. We also examine the role of strategic partnerships in capturing value created through the exploitation of data resources. We conclude that while data often serve as a required resource for entry into new markets, strategic partnerships play a critical role in capturing value created through the exploitation of data resources. The emergent partnership structures are remarkably similar across the two organizations. They target rapid market expansion through encapsulation of data resources within highly scalable web services and the use of standardized legal contracts. We also find that temporal decoupling between value creation and value capture can expose firms to the erosion of the competitive advantage gained through investment in data resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Competitive advantage; Data resource; Partnerships; Relational view; Resource-based view; Value capture; Value creation","Big data; Commerce; Competition; Investments; Web services; Competitive advantage; Data resources; Partnerships; Relational views; Resource-based view; Value captures; Value creation; Data encapsulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038877244

A number of scholars have sought to combine data mining with traditional econometric analyses. Typically, data mining methods are first used to generate new variables (e.g., text sentiment), which are added into subsequent econometric models as independent regressors. However, because prediction is almost always imperfect, variables generated from the first-stage data mining models inevitably contain measurement error or misclassification. These errors, if ignored, can introduce systematic biases into the second-stage econometric estimations and threaten the validity of statistical inference. In this commentary, we examine the nature of this bias, both analytically and empirically, and show that it can be severe even when data mining models exhibit relatively high performance. We then show that this bias becomes increasingly difficult to anticipate as the functional form of the measurement error or the specification of the econometric model grows more complex. We review several methods for error correction and focus on two simulation-based methods, SIMEX and MC-SIMEX, which can be easily parameterized using standard performance metrics from data mining models, such as error variance or the confusion matrix, and can be applied under a wide range of econometric specifications. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SIMEX and MC-SIMEX by simulations and subsequent application of the methods to econometric estimations employing variables mined from three real-world data sets related to travel, social networking, and crowdfunding campaign websites. © 2017 INFORMS.","Data mining; Econometrics; Measurement error; Misclassification; Statistical inference","Economics; Error correction; Errors; Information systems; Measurement errors; Specifications; Statistical methods; Statistics; Systematic errors; Econometrics; Extracting information; Large amounts of data; Misclassifications; Predictive data mining; Simulation-based method; Standard performance; Statistical inference; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043991353

There have been many studies, including some replications, done in various parts of the world to further the debate on whether competitive priorities are mutually supportive or if they present potential trade-offs, but hardly any from a rapidly growing economy, such as India. This study is a significant attempt in that direction. After a thorough review of the literature, a set of hypotheses is introduced to test whether Indian manufacturers view competitive priorities as mutually supportive or trade-offs. The data from over 150 high-ranking individuals from over 75 manufacturers in India is used to test the hypotheses by way of cluster analysis and ANOVA. The resultant taxonomy reveals patterns that uniquely represent Indian manufacturers' view of the competitive priorities, namely quality, flexibility, delivery and price. The study findings have significant managerial implications, both for India and other developing as well as developed economies. The taxonomy will serve to gauge India's manufacturers' role in the world. From a researcher's perspective, this study makes a significant contribution to theory development, furthers our understanding of the strategic role of operations, moves forward the ongoing debate on the topic of trade-offs or complementarity, and paves the way for future studies in this topical area. © 2018 The Authors","Competitive priorities; Cumulative competencies; India; Operations strategy; Sandcone model; Taxonomy; Trade-offs","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Manufacture; Taxonomies; Competitive priorities; Cumulative competencies; India; Operations strategies; Trade off; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054452296

Although existing models partially predict such variations, so far, they have been unable to predict oil prices accurately in this highly volatile market. The development of an effective, predictive model has therefore become a prime objective of research in this field. Our approach, albeit based in part on previous research, develops an original methodology, in that we have created a risk forecasting model with the ability to predict oil price fluctuations caused by changes in both fundamental and transient risk factors. We achieve this by disintegrating the multi-scale risk-structure of the crude oil market using Variational Mode Decomposition. Normal and transient risk factors are then extracted from the crude oil price using Variational Mode Decomposition and modelled separately using the Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model. Both risk factors are integrated and ensembled to produce the risk estimates. We then apply our proposed risk forecasting model to predicting future downside risk level in three major crude oil markets, namely the West Taxes Intermediate (WTI), the Brent Market, and the OPEC market. The results demonstrate that our model has the ability to capture downside risk estimates with significantly improved precision, thus reducing estimation errors and increasing forecasting reliability. © 2018","Crude oil risk forecasting; Multiscale analysis; Normal Risk; Quantile Regression Neural Network model; Transient Risk; Value at Risk; Variational Mode Decomposition","Commerce; Crude oil; Forecasting; Neural networks; Petroleum analysis; Risk perception; Value engineering; Mode decomposition; Multi scale analysis; Quantile regression; Risk forecasting; Value at Risk; Risk assessment; artificial neural network; crude oil; energy market; estimation method; prediction; price dynamics; regression analysis; risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057808832

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model was empirically tested using survey data from 381 teenagers. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: Parent–child communication, peers, media and self-construal have varying influence on technology readiness of teenagers. The effects of parent–child interactions are mediated by self-construal, which reaffirms the importance of identity during adolescence. Research limitations/implications: The culture-specific characteristics are critical antecedents to teenagers’ TRI. Moreover, the TRI 2.0 scale needs minor refinement to address culturally diverse marketplace where people are less familiar with the technical terms used in developed countries and display low levels of technology awareness. Practical implications: Marketers need to tailor their communication strategies to have a strong presence on digital media to engage with teenagers. Firms should utilize media for providing information and develop content that should resonate with teens and potentially enhances their online impression to increase the adoption of technology.

A mismatch is observed between the rapidly changing devices entering the market and the slowly evolving voluntary design policies, regulations, and e-waste processing business strategies. Conventional electronic waste (e-waste) management systems were historically optimized to extract high-value components from large products that were relatively easy to disassemble, but the products now entering the waste stream are more often light-weight mobile devices that are typically not covered by regulations or do not contain as high a concentration of valuable metals. This article proposes that transformations in the e-waste processing system aimed at closing the material loop should look to the circular processes found in natural ecosystems, which have evolved to optimize closed loop nutrient cycling. Like species in nature, e-waste processors make decisions about where and what to “eat,” balancing a food's quality and abundance with the energy expended in obtaining it. Adapting the concept of optimal foraging theory, we demonstrate here a conceptual framework that draws parallels between foraging behavior in the ecological and industrial world, evaluates four potential mathematical models that case be applied to the e-waste case, and demonstrate how optimal foraging decisions can guide business, design, and end of life management toward circular economy goals in the consumer electronic system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Consumer electronics; E-waste; Nutrient cycling; Optimal foraging theory; Recycling","Consumer behavior; Consumer electronics; Electronic Waste; Linear systems; Nutrients; Recycling; Wastes; Circular economy; Conceptual frameworks; Electronic waste (e waste); End of life managements; Management systems; Nutrient cycling; Optimal foraging theory; Optimized recycling; Electronic equipment; conceptual framework; electronic waste; numerical model; optimization; pollution policy; recycling; regulatory framework; strategic approach; Article; circular economy; conceptual framework; controlled study; ecological foraging model; economic aspect; ecosystem; electronic waste; energy expenditure; environmental parameters; food availability; food quality; life cycle assessment; mathematical model; nutrient cycling; optimal foraging; process optimization; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047043161

However, existing literature does not capture the effect of slot allocation decisions on the acceptability of slot schedules. The objective of this paper is to investigate the trade-off between scheduling efficiency and the airlines’ dis-utility of slot schedules expressed by various metrics of schedule displacement. We develop and solve two bi-objective scheduling models considering different combinations of total and maximum acceptable slot displacement objectives. The proposed models are applied to real-world scheduling data. Substantial improvements in schedule acceptability metrics are achieved without sacrificing a lot in terms of scheduling efficiency. Sacrifices in scheduling efficiency increase the capability of the airport coordinator to allocate slots that are eventually acceptable and hence more intensively used. © 2017 The Authors","Airport scheduling; Bi-objective optimisation; Demand management; Slot allocation","Air traffic control; Airports; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Electric load management; Traffic congestion; Airport capacity; Bi objectives; Bi-objective scheduling; Congestion problem; Real-world scheduling; Scheduling efficiencies; Scheduling models; Slot allocation; Scheduling; airport; decision making; demand-side management; optimization; resource allocation; trade-off; traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032948448

With the development of social network services, consumers are exposed to reviews coming from friends and the crowd. However, the impact of friend and crowd reviews on consumer posting behaviour has not been well differentiated. Using online review information as well as underlying social network information from Yelp, this research develops a multilevel mixed effect probit model to study the impact of consumer characteristics and reviews of different sources. This involves friends or the crowd, and the likelihood of the consumer further engaging in posting behaviour. Despite the common perception that the volume, valence and variance of reviews significantly impact the likelihood of following posting behaviour, we found that such influence comes from friend reviews. The volume of friend reviews had much stronger impact on the target user's posting behaviour than that of the crowd. The valence and variance of the crowd reviews showed no influence when ignoring the friend reviews, but negative influence when considering it. The friend reviews and crowd reviews were further divided for positive and negative valences, and only the positive friend reviews and negative crowd review were found to enhance posting. © 2018","Crowd's reviews; Friends’ reviews; Online reviews; Posting behaviour; Review valence; Review variance; Review volume; Social influence; Social networks; Word-of-mouth","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Online reviews; Posting behaviour; Review valences; Social influence; Word of mouth; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045637387

Considering the consumer market demand and downstream investment conditions as input, we model a game in a two-tier supply chain where downstream firms choose to adopt different levels of an upstream technology and an upstream technology leader determines its pricing policy. We identify two necessary but distinct elements for the successful development, adoption, and diffusion of upstream technologies that are sold to lower tiers as components within final products. (1) The level of technology demanded by the market: We develop a measure, Technological Potential, which describes the highest level of an upstream technology demanded by consumer markets. (2) A sufficiently rich return to an upstream innovator, as a function of different levels of technology. From these two elements, we show that the relative magnitudes of two competing sets of consumer market factors determine the Technological Potential whereas the overall magnitude of the factors in both sets determines the return to the upstream developer. We discuss how this difference in consumer market factors’ influence on these two elements may determine how different technologies fare in the supply chain. Our results have managerial implications for: investors in research and development project selection in identifying profitable technologies that are also demanded at higher capability levels; and for governments in defining more targeted public policies – for example in choosing the right tier of a supply chain to provide subsidies – to encourage market support for certain technologies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Innovation; OR in research and development; Supply chains; Technology","Commerce; Competition; Consumer products; Economics; Innovation; Supply chains; Technology; Competitive supply chains; Distinct elements; Innovation and technology; Managerial implications; Research and development; Research and development projects; Technological advances; Upstream technology; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029563684

This paper proposes an enhanced collaborative filtering approach based on sentiment assessment to discover the potential preferences of customers, and to predict customers’ future requirements for business services or products (collectively referred to as “entities”). Specifically, this approach involves three major steps: aspect-level sentiment assessment, customer preference mining and personalized recommendation. First, the aspect-level sentiment assessment transforms OCRs to a structured aspect-level review vector. Second, customer preference mining uses the vector to extract aspect-level feature words from sentiments and assigns polarity score to each sentiment. Finally, the feature words and sentiment polarity score are used to calculate customer preference and customers’ similarities. Personalized recommendation for services and products are generated according to customer similarity. Experiments are conducted based on the data from one of the most popular electronic commerce websites in China (www.JD.com). The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional collaborative filtering approaches in effectively recommending entities to target customers especially in the long term. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Collaborative filtering; Online customer reviews (OCRs); Personalized recommendation; Sentiment assessment","Electronic commerce; Sales; Websites; Business decisions; Customer preferences; E-commerce websites; Feature words; Information sources; Online customer review; Online customer reviews; Personalized recommendation; Preference mining; Sentiment assessment; Collaborative filtering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033495479

Using two unique panel data sets of entry and expansion of U.S. wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiaries overseas, we found that industrial disasters are associated with reduced foreign entry of wholly-owned subsidiaries in the disaster industry, but not for all firms in the host country experiencing the disaster. We also found that MNCs' technological, safety management, and philanthropic capabilities can, in some cases, positively moderate the negative relationships between industrial disasters and the foreign entry and expansion of wholly-owned subsidiaries. Additionally, three-way interactions with government stability suggest that technological and safety management capabilities substitute government stability in managing industrial disasters, while philanthropic capability complements government stability. Managerial Summary: How can MNCs' technological, safety management, and philanthropic capabilities overcome the effects of industrial disasters such as chemical spills and explosions in host countries? Our results show that industrial disasters are associated with reduced foreign entry of wholly-owned subsidiaries in the industry in which the industrial disaster occurs, but not for other firms operating in the country experiencing the disaster. However, an MNC's technological capability can, in general, lower the negative consequences of industrial disasters in both the entry and expansion of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Regarding the institutional quality of a host country, the results imply that MNCs should develop philanthropic capability when the government stability of the host country is strong, and develop technological and safety management capabilities when the government stability is weak.

Eco-city development has also raised similar concerns. This research was conducted in order to address such problems. Specifically, this paper develops a new sustainability index that emphasizes environmental justice for the purpose of better classifying and assessing eco-cities. The proposed index measures equity among places as a result of eco-city development. Specifically, this index indicates instances in which a certain location achieves sustainability through means detrimental to another location. Thus, the index, comprised of environmental, economic, and social indicators of sustainability, may also be used to foster justice among diverse locations (urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, and neighboring cities) by highlighting the genuine motives behind eco-city development. One preliminary finding from the application of this classification is that oftentimes, eco-city development is not completed in the environmental, economic, or social interests of the people. Official eco-cities tend to serve government officials’ interest in upper mobility. Developer eco-cities tend to be commercial expansions or developments focused on growth, profit, and model demonstration. Both official and developer eco-cities degrade the environment. They are also likely to develop urban centers at the environmental expense of other places. The economic growth of official and developer eco-cities is accompanied by worsening income inequality and social injustice. As a result, these types of eco-cities fail the sustainability performance assessment. Conversely, eco-cities founded by the citizens or by donors tend to focus on social and economic equity. This study was completed using qualitative research methods, including field work in 29 eco-cities throughout China and various countries. This field work was conducted from 2006 to 2014.

First, the identification of the marginal effect requires a measure of at least one component of risk that cannot be diversified or avoided. Moreover, measures of uninsurable wage risk must vary over time to eliminate unobserved heterogeneity. Secondly, evaluating the economic significance of risk requires knowledge of the size of all the wage risk actually faced. Existing estimates are problematic because measures of wage risk fail to satisfy the ""non-avoidability"" requirement. This creates a downward bias, which is at the root of the small estimated effect of wage risk on portfolio choices. To tackle this problem we match panel data of workers and firms and use the variability in the profitability of the firm that is passed over to workers to obtain a measure of uninsurable risk. Using this measure to instrument total variability in individual earnings, we find that the marginal effect of uninsurable wage risk is much larger than estimates that ignore endogeneity. We bound the economic impact of risk and find that its overall effect is contained, not because its marginal effect is small but because its size is small. And the size of uninsurable wage risk is small because firms provide substantial wage insurance. © The Author 2017.","Background risk; Firm shocks; Portfolio choice; Uninsurable wage risk","economic impact; finance; heterogeneity; panel data; profitability; risk factor; wage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040785976

This is the first empirical study to examine the effects of PFL on long-term care patterns. Multivariate difference-in-difference estimates across alternative comparison groups provide consistent evidence that the implementation of PFL reduced the proportion of the elderly population in nursing homes by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points. Our preferred estimate, employing an empirically-matched group of control states, finds that PFL reduced nursing home usage by about 0.65 percentage points.

We utilise a model of the Intel supply chain to analytically explore the underlying mechanisms of bullwhip generation and compare its dynamic performance to the well-known Inventory and Order-Based Production Control System (IOBPCS) archetype. Adopting a control engineering approach, we find that the feedforward forecasting compensation in the MTO element plays a major role in the degree of bullwhip and the Customer Order Decoupling Point (CODP) profoundly impacts both the bullwhip effect and the inventory variance in the MTS part.

We selected two simulation tools as research instruments to investigate a broader question on the usefulness of LIWC to guide choice of DSS tool. The tools selected were System Dynamics (SD) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES). First, we tested LIWC to analyze practitioners’ language use when developing models. LIWC pointed out significant linguistic differences consistent with prior theoretical work, based on model development approach in a number of dimensions. These differences provided a basis for developing a custom dictionary for use on the second part of our study. The second part of the study focused on language used by decision makers in problem statements and used the linguistic clues identified in the first part of the study to ensure problem/model fit. Results indicated problem statements contained linguistic clues related to the type of information desired by problem solvers.

Decisions about where to send the patients are typically made in an ad hoc manner by responders on the scene. Using a Markov decision process formulation, we develop two heuristic policies that use limited information such as mean travel times and congestion levels to determine (a) how to allocate ambulances to patient locations and (b) which medical facility should be the destination for those ambulances. In a simulation study, we incorporate patient survival rates and service times for different types of traumatic injuries, and show that the proposed heuristics can provide substantial improvement in the expected number of survivors compared to the common practice of transporting to the nearest facility, even when the decision maker has only limited up-to-date information about the system state. In particular, a myopic approach that considers only what is best for the next patient to be transported increases the expected number of survivors in almost all scenarios considered. Using a more sophisticated one-step policy improvement approach provides further improvement when the event involves patients who do not deteriorate rapidly, especially when the transportation is not the bottleneck and the casualties are spread over many locations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics on a case study of a hypothetical earthquake, where casualty data is generated using computer software developed by the U.S. government. © 2018 INFORMS.","Disaster response; Mass-casualty incident; Queueing network; Routing; Transportation","Ambulances; Decision making; Markov processes; Mass transportation; Queueing networks; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Disaster response; Dynamic distribution; Emergency responders; Limited information; Markov Decision Processes; Mass casualty incidents; Routing; Transportation resources; Emergency services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049384275

One example is the Volkswagen Emission Gate Scandal. Using firm-level panel data of major automobile manufacturers from 2000 to 2015, this study empirically identifies the motives behind the corporate deception scandal. We develop a conceptual model summarising the factors affecting decision-making, and the firms' environmentally responsible investments (ERIs) including the truthfulness of related public communications. Our findings identify legal and regulatory pressures, the firm's existing level of ERIs competency and expertise, pressures from emission regulation, market competitors, consumers, owners, or shareholders as the key factors inducing the scandal. The empirical findings show that firms are more likely to experience corporate fraud if their senior managers are paid with substantial variable components that may lead them to engage in riskier business behaviour and to be more short-term focused, thereby supporting the well-established contract theory. To avoid corporate fraud and engage in legitimate business competitiveness, we suggest that firms should focus on technological innovation as well as improving corporate governance and leverage ratios to effectively control and monitor management. In addition, policy makers should be more realistic about practical and commercial limitations in the policy-setting process, and take on a more supporting role in achieving technological innovations and effective corporate governance. In summary, we argue that cleaner production is not only the result of technologically progress and research, but importantly it also involves issues associated with corporate governance and business ethics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business ethics; Climate policy; Cooperategovernance; Corporate fraud; Environmental responsible investments Model (ERIs); Volkswagen Emissions Scandal","Automobile manufacture; Climate models; Crime; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Industrial management; Philosophical aspects; Pollution control; Public policy; Business ethics; Climate policy; Cooperategovernance; Corporate frauds; Environmental responsible investments Model (ERIs); Volkswagen; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038812367

Findings – The results show that operations capability, as an important dynamic capability, has a significant positive effect on productivity, which in turn leads to improved business performance. The results also suggest that productivity fully mediates the relationship between operations capability and business performance, and that environmental dynamism significantly moderates the relationship between operations capability and productivity. Practical implications – The research findings provide practical insights that will help managers develop operations capability to gain greater productivity and business performance in a dynamic environment.

Three studies demonstrate that the use of bundling in combination with dynamic pricing (dynamic bundling) can reduce consumer unfairness perceptions. The negative effects of dynamic pricing are mitigated by bundling.

Using the survey data collected from owners of passive solar panels in rural areas, this study examines the importance of selected reasons in household decision to participate in the EU-funded solar panel subsidy program augmented by contributions from local governments and each household. Associations between nine reasons to invest in a solar panel and characteristics of respondents, their households, and solar panel features were examined using correlation coefficients. An ordered logit technique was also applied and calculations based on estimation results yielded probability changes in the relative importance attached to a selected reason for investing in a panel in response to a change in a respondent, household, or solar panel characteristic. The desire to save on energy used to heat space or water, and lower the energy bill as well as being unemployed or having part-time employment increased the probability of viewing the total cost, installation cost, subsidy, and the energy costs prior to having a solar panel as important. Those viewing the solar energy favorably were, overall, less likely to consider lowering the energy bill prior to putting a solar panel as important, while those perceiving solar panel features as troublesome were also less likely to view the listed reasons as important. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coal use reduction; Energy cost saving; Solar panel; Solar panel feature; Subsidy","Air quality; Costs; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heating; Rural areas; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Correlation coefficient; Energy cost savings; Estimation results; Household decisions; Installation costs; Renewable energy use; Solar panels; Subsidy; Investments; fossil fuel; coal; energy conservation; European Union; household energy; investment; rural area; solar power; subsidy system; air pollutant; air quality; Article; consumer attitude; cost control; employment status; energy balance; energy conservation; energy cost; environmental change; government; household income; particulate matter; parttime employment; Poland; renewable energy; rural area; rural population; solar energy; total quality management; unemployment; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053079711

This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the routes and the speeds of ATs making deliveries under uncertain traffic conditions. The aim is to reduce the cost of emissions, fuel consumption and travel times. The traffic conditions are represented by a discrete set of scenarios, using which the problem is modeled in the form of two-stage stochastic programming formulations using two different recourse strategies. The strategies differ in the amount of information available during the decision making process. Computational results show the added value of stochastic modeling over a deterministic approach and the quantified benefits of optimizing speed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous trucks; Green VRP; Speed optimization; Stochastic programming","Automobiles; Behavioral research; Decision making; Stochastic programming; Travel time; Trucks; Amount of information; Computational results; Decision making process; Deterministic approach; Emerging technologies; Green VRP; Speed optimization; Two-stage stochastic programming; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050762518

The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape. © 2017, Association for Information Technology Trust.","accountability; compliance systems; ethics; financial crisis; financial technology; fintech; regtech; regulatory technology; surveillance","Financial markets; Information management; Investments; Monitoring; Privatization; Space surveillance; Transparency; accountability; ethics; Financial crisis; fintech; regtech; Regulatory compliance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038390447

To this end, we use the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and the causality-in-quantiles methods to measure the impact of these variables on non-oil GDP. The results show that past non-oil GDP shocks affect current non-oil GDP strongly in the short term. Moreover, a surge in public investment increases non-oil GDP in both the short- and long-run, while a negative private investment shock reduces non-oil GDP in both the short- and long-run. Furthermore, positive (negative) oil production shocks increase the non-oil GDP also in the short- and long-run. In addition, we find a positive relationship between negative and positive inflation shocks and non-oil GDP in the long run, while negative inflation shocks decrease non-oil GDP. Using the nonparametric causality-in- quantile approach, we find that causality-in-the mean and causality-in-the variance emanating from the four explanatory variables vary across the quantiles. Finally, non-oil GDP does not Granger cause these macroeconomic variables. Those non-standard macroeconomic results for this major oil exporter are different from those for well-diversified developed countries. Regardless, they have important implications for Saudi policy makers involved in the Vision 2030 initiative, international organizations and institutional investors. © 2017 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy","Causality-in-quantiles; Investments; Macroeconomic variables; NARDL; Non-oil GDP; Saudi Arabia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034419937

Based on this, a novel bi-level data envelopment analysis model with multiple followers is developed, in order to evaluate the performance of overall bi-level system as well as each player in detail. Then the extended Kuhn–Tucker conditions are used to solve the proposed model.

For the empirical study, we use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that has been widely used for environmental assessment and performance measurement. The conventional use of DEA requests that all observations in the data set should be positive, prohibiting an occurrence of zero and/or negative values. The requirement of non-negative value is inconsistent with the reality of US petroleum industry, because many oil firms recently experience negative shocks in financial performance. To overcome the obstacle, this study discusses the property of “translation invariance” under undesirable congestion (e.g., capacity limit in the transportation pipeline network) and desirable congestion (e.g., green technology innovation) based on the non-radial models. The property implies that the unified efficiency measure should be not influenced even if production factors are shifted toward the same direction by adding or subtracting a specific real number. The property makes it possible that we can evaluate the performance of firms, whose production factors contain zero and/or negative values. This study is empirically concerned with practical implications of translation invariance from energy and environmental perspectives. In addition, this study examines the proposed environmental assessment in a time horizon. For the purpose, this study uses “window analysis” to examine an efficiency change along with a time shift. Our empirical investigation finds the following three implications. First, under the natural disposability, the oil firms' efficiency growth rates have become less than unity, implying the industry-wide difficulty or inability to cut back their drilling and production operations. Second, all firms have been under regulatory and stakeholder pressures on air pollution. Therefore, the efficiency growth rates under managerial disposability have not exhibited a major change during the observed annual periods. Finally, such implications are statistically reconfirmed by regression analysis that examines how the change of energy price influences unified efficiencies under natural and managerial disposability. An exception can be found in the natural disposability where energy prices influence their efficiency growths. Thus, an increase in energy prices is important in maintaining a high level of efficiency growths in the US petroleum industry. © 2018","DEA environmental assessment; Non-radial approach; Petroleum industry; Translation invariance","Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Managers; Petroleum analysis; Regression analysis; Empirical investigation; Environmental assessment; Financial performance; Non-radial approach; Performance measurements; Production operations; Translation invariance; Transportation pipelines; Petroleum industry; data envelopment analysis; empirical analysis; environmental assessment; growth rate; oil industry; petroleum; price determination; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046079105

Prior theory is incomplete, however, and prior studies have lacked comprehensive and reliable data on firm-level bribery decisions. We offer a new theoretical prediction and a novel data set on high-level corruption in South Korea, where the accounting records of two presidents in the 1987–1992 era were exposed to after-the-fact legal and public scrutiny. We find that, controlling for a range of alternative explanations, the threat of falling high status—that is, the combination of longstanding high social status with current-period mediocre economic performance relative to that of industry peers—is a statistically and economically meaningful predictor of increases in the amount of large-scale corporate bribery. Managerial Summary: What leads companies to engage in large-scale bribery of senior politicians? Our concept of “threat of falling high status” refers to a circumstance where companies that have historically enjoyed high status through their owner families’ elite marriage networks experience mediocre economic performance relative to their peers. We show that this threat of falling high status is a notable determinant of large-scale corporate bribery of senior politicians, using court data on corporate bribery of two South Korean presidents during 1987–1992. The implication of our study is twofold. Companies can strengthen internal control systems to avoid any large-scale illegal activities at a higher level. Law enforcement agencies can also implement targeted monitoring programs to preempt illegal activities among companies facing the threat of falling high status.

In this paper, we consider the assumption of weak input disposability. It states that any activity remains feasible if its inputs are simultaneously scaled up in the same proportion. As suggested in the literature, the Shephard technology incorporating weak input disposability could be used to evaluate the effect of input congestion. We show that the Shephard technology is not convex and therefore introduces bias in evaluation of congestion. To address this, we develop an alternative convex technology whose use in the evaluation of congestion removes the noted bias. We undertake a further axiomatic investigation and obtain a range of production technologies, all of which exhibit weak input disposability but are based on different, progressively relaxed, convexity assumptions. Apart from the evaluation of input congestion, such technologies should also be useful in applications in which some inputs are closely related or are overlapping, and therefore satisfy only the weak input disposability assumption incorporated in the new models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Congestion; Data envelopment analysis; Production technology; Weak input disposability","Mathematical models; Operations research; Congestion; Efficiency analysis; Input congestion; Non-parametric; Production technology; Production theory; Scaled-up; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031324897

Then, the congestion of any inefficient DMU is defined at its projection on the efficient frontier of this technology. It has, however, been argued that this definition is not precise under the occurrence of multiple projections. In this paper, therefore, we propose a single-stage linear programming (LP) model to recognize the evidence of congestion. Our model precisely distinguishes between the DMUs exhibiting weak—but not strong—congestion and those suffering from strong congestion, and identifies the full-efficient DMUs as well. To cope effectively with the occurrence of multiple projections, we first prove that all relative interior points of a face exhibit the same type of congestion. Based on this finding, we define the congestion of an inefficient DMU at its MAX-projection—a projection that lies in the relative interior of the corresponding minimum face. Then, by showing that the global reference set spans the minimum face, we propose an LP model for identifying the MAX-projection. We highlight a theoretically interesting and practically useful consequence of our results that the congestion status of an inefficient DMU can be determined based on those of its reference DMUs. Furthermore, our proposed method can deal with negative data, and is also computationally more efficient than the existing approaches. Finally, three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the use of our proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Congestion; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Global reference set (GRS); Multiple projections; Negative data","Data envelopment analysis; Linear programming; Numerical methods; Congestion; Congestion status; Decision making unit; Efficient frontier; Linear programming models; Multiple projections; Negative data; Reference set; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028058414

It is widely acknowledged that an evaluation of fire protection performance is critical for such efforts. In this paper, we propose a new data envelopment analysis-based approach for fire protection efficiency analysis in the United States at the state level. For this purpose, the fire protection system is generalised as an innovative two-stage network process, in which the fire hazard defence subsystem in the first stage is followed by a fire incident fighting subsystem in the second stage. Further, both intermediate outputs and final outputs are all undesirable measures. The fire protection expenditure, a kind of shared resources, is modelled under managerial disposability since it can be intentionally used to reduce fires and fire damages. Based on an empirical study of data from 2010 to 2014, we find that: (1) Texas, California, New York, Florida, and Illinois are the top five states prone to fire incidents. (2) The United States as a whole has an average fire protection efficiency of 0.590, implying relatively low fire protection performances at the state level. (3) Wyoming, Vermont, and Rhode Island are the top three most efficient states, whereas Iowa, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania are ranked the least efficient. Further, (4) the fire incident fighting efficiency is more likely to be higher than the fire hazard defence efficiency for most states. (5) Looking at larger scale by grouping all states into eight areas, the Far West has the highest fire protection efficiency, while Southeast and Plains areas have the lowest efficiency scores. Interestingly, (6) the results show also that a 1% increase in the fire protection expenditure by states per capita will result in a 2.6893% improvement in fire protection efficiency. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Data envelopment analysis; Fire protection efficiency; Managerial disposability; Two-stage network; Undesirable outputs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030172905

Nevertheless, the deterministic DEA model suffers from a possible lack of statistical power, especially in a small sample.

Contrary to common wisdom, this study posits that uncertainty prompts firms to invest in R&D. The value to invest under uncertainty is, however, bounded by a firm's learning conditions (i.e., human capital, relatedness of innovation activities, and industry maturity). An empirical test on a cross-industry panel of 551 business divisions of manufacturing firms reveals how organization-environment interactions determine the firm-specific value to invest in learning prior to full-scale commercialization. The insights help to bridge real options theory and the learning literature. Managerial Summary: Uncertainty about the market environment makes investment decisions in R&D and the commercialization of new products a challenge: should firms “wait and see” until uncertainty resolves to avoid the risk of betting on the wrong product or commit further resources regardless? Our analysis suggests that manufacturing firms often take a mixed approach (“act and see”). While deferring investments in the commercialization of new products, they undertake further R&D to inform decision making by insights that would otherwise be unavailable. However, we find that the benefit of such practice depends on the learning conditions of the individual firm. What is risky for firms with disadvantages in human capital and technology development is value enhancing for firms with good foundations for learning through R&D.

This is problematic as strong team attachments such as team identification may have mixed effects on team innovative behavior, and may even negatively impact cross-team innovative behavior. The present research explains these mixed effects through intra- and intergroup aspects of social identity theory and the concept of team reflexivity. Effects of team identification on team innovative behavior were expected to be contingent upon team reflexivity, such that team identification would be positively related to team innovative behavior only when team reflexivity was high. Where a team's innovative behavior involves working across team boundaries with other teams, i.e., cross-team innovative behavior, this interaction between team identification and reflexivity was further expected to be qualified by perceived interdependence with another team. In a sample of 61 Turkish research and development (R&D) teams comprising 305 employees and 61 team leaders, the association between team identity and team innovative behavior was moderated by team reflexivity as predicted. Further, team identity was positively associated with cross-team innovative behavior only when reflexivity and perceived interdependence between teams were both high, and negatively associated when reflexivity was low and perceived interdependence between teams was high. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Mixed effects; Research and development; Social identity theories; Team identification; Team leaders; Team reflexivities; Turkishs; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045941296

Based on evidence from the literature on philanthropic behaviour, we argue that funder behaviour is likely to be driven by a combination of intrinsic, extrinsic and image enhancement motivations. We undertake an empirical investigation into the relationships between these factors by analysing data from an online rewards-based crowdfunding platform. These data not only reveal the monetary values of individual contributions to fundraising campaigns but also indicate particular combinations of motivations based on the material reward selected (if any) and the decision as to whether or not to contribute anonymously. We find that extrinsically motivated funders generally make larger contributions than intrinsically motivated funders, which does not suggest the presence of a ‘crowding-out’ effect given the presence of material incentives. We further show that named funders with intrinsic motivations contribute more than anonymous funders with intrinsic motivations, whereas the same pattern of behaviour is not observed among extrinsically motivated funders. The evidence from our study therefore suggests that image concerns interact with intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in different ways. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"decision making; empirical analysis; Internet; literature review; social behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045934540

Simultaneous equations models are used to study social interactions, strategic interactions between firms, and market equilibrium. Random coefficient models allow for heterogeneous marginal effects. I show that random coefficient seemingly unrelated regression models with common regressors are not point identified, which implies random coefficient simultaneous equations models are not point identified. Important features of these models, however, can be identified. For two-equation systems, I give two sets of sufficient conditions for point identification of the coefficients' marginal distributions conditional on exogenous covariates. The first allows for small support continuous instruments under tail restrictions on the distributions of unobservables which are necessary for point identification. The second requires full support instruments, but allows for nearly arbitrary distributions of unobservables. I discuss how to generalize these results to many equation systems, where I focus on linear-in-means models with heterogeneous endogenous social interaction effects. I give sufficient conditions for point identification of the distributions of these endogenous social effects. I propose a consistent nonparametric kernel estimator for these distributions based on the identification arguments. I apply my results to the Add Health data to analyse peer effects in education. © The Author 2017.

Therefore this paper tests lean-based propositions pertaining to the relationships between inventory slack, capacity slack, market instability and firm market performance. Using retail firm data from a 35 year period, we find that lean thinking in its basic unadorned form helps explain retail performance remarkably well.

Mapping the five steps involved in the resource reframing process onto the different parts of the Bower-Burgelman process model of strategic change shows that innovators can shape the strategic context for their autonomous innovations before external market validation is available. These findings confirm the unique potential and importance of different forms of discourse in shaping the strategic innovation process. Managerial Summary: How do innovators from lower levels of an organization gain approval for their innovations especially when their ideas do not readily fit their organization's strategy? To explore this question, we conducted 138 interviews with innovators and their decision makers in 14 firms based in Silicon Valley. We find that successful innovators shape a story supporting their innovation by rethinking their firm's current and potential resources. They then use this story to convince decision makers that their innovation creates unique competitive advantage. Contrary to conventional wisdom, decision makers approved such innovations even without external validation, solely based on the innovators' success in depicting their reorganization of the firm's resources.

Specifically, our findings indicate that the volume of negative consumer reviews drive consumers' purchasing decisions, but the volume of positive consumers reviews only marginally affects purchasing decisions. Also, consumers generate more positive reviews than negative reviews after sales. Our results highlight the importance of negative consumer reviews; negative reviews not only lead to sales, but sales, in turn, lead to higher volume of negative reviews.

Machine performance depends primarily on frequency and downtime; therefore, ranking critical machines based on these two criteria is important to determine the appropriate maintenance strategy. The purpose of this paper is to compare two methods, using case studies, to allocate maintenance strategies while prioritising performance based on frequency and downtime or Mean Time to Repair: the Decision Making Grid (DMG) and Jack-Knife Diagram (JKD). Design/methodology/approach - The literature indicates the need for an approach able to integrate maintenance performance and strategy in order to adapt existing data on equipment failures and to routinely adjust preventive measures. Maintenance strategies are incomparable; one strategy should not be applied to all machines, nor all strategies to the same machine. Findings - Compared to the Pareto histogram, the DMG and JKD provide visual representations of the performance of the worst machines with respect to frequency and downtime, thus allowing maintenance technicians to apply the appropriate maintenance strategy. Each method has its own merits. Research limitations/implications - This work compares only two methods based on their original conceptualisation. This is due to their similarities in using same input data and their main features. However, there is a scope to compare to other methods or variations of these methods. Practical implications - This paper highlights how the DMG and JKD can be incorporated in industrial applications to allocate appropriate maintenance strategy and track machine performance over time. Originality/value - Neither DMG nor JKD have been compared in the literature. Currently, the JKD has been used to rank machines, and the DMG has been used to determine maintenance strategies. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making grid; Jack-Knife Diagram; Maintenance management","Maintenance; Preventive maintenance; Repair; Design/methodology/approach; Machine performance; Maintenance management; Maintenance performance; Maintenance strategies; Mean time to repairs; Preventive measures; Visual representations; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043274115

We formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the option value of CVC and the decision to exercise the RO using a dyadic dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. Our findings suggest that the option value of CVC is higher for investors with weaker scientific capabilities; engaging the markets for technology in distant technological fields; and, when their innovation pipeline is tilted toward the late-stage development process. Finally, the licensing of high-value technologies is the most likely form of option exercise when technological uncertainty is reduced post-CVC. Managerial Summary: Despite the fact that one of the main goals of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments in high-tech industries is to gain a window on future technologies, the relationship between CVC and other strategies used to acquire external technologies, such as licensing, has not been adequately explored. To address this gap, we formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the decision to make CVC investments as a wait-and-see strategy in the markets for technology (MFT) using a longitudinal dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. We find that investors' scientific capabilities, technological domains, and research pipelines impact investors' decisions to make CVC investments prior to other MFT transactions. In our research setting, investors typically acquire high-value technologies via licensing when technological uncertainty is reduced post-CVC. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","absorptive capacity; corporate venture capital; markets for technology; product pipeline; real options","Biotechnology; Commerce; Mergers and acquisitions; Pipelines; Absorptive capacity; Corporate venture capital; Development process; Future technologies; Markets for technology; Pharmaceutical firms; Real Options; Technological uncertainty; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054689363

Applying stochastic actor-oriented models on longitudinal relational data from a mature cluster in a medium-tech industry, we show that triadic closure and geographical proximity increase the probability of tie creation but does not influence tie persistence. Cognitive proximity is positively correlated to tie persistence but firms create ties to cognitively proximate firms only if they are loosely connected through common third partners. We propose a micro-perspective to understand how endogenous network effects, cognitive proximity of actors and their interplay influence the evolutionary process of network formation in clusters. © The Author (2017).

FIPs vary in design and aim, making their evaluation complex. Studies to date have highlighted successes but also raised concerns about the performance of FIPs in improving fisheries. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of attributes on all public FIPs, combined with sustainability performance data on the management of the target fisheries, their fishing levels, and stock status, this paper evaluates the performance of FIPs worldwide on improving fisheries, using exploratory data analysis methods and regression-based statistical approaches. The results showed that FIPs improved critical problems in target fisheries in the range between 60% and 82%, depending on the sustainability criteria considered. Performance did not vary between artisanal and industrial FIPs or according to the economic development status of the country. The probability of achieving improvements in management and overfishing domains is higher for fisheries with FIPs compared to those without. Variability in performance was related to the specific characteristics and history of each FIP, based on which further steps in research were suggested. © 2018 The Authors","FIP; Fishery improvement project; FishSource; Management; Supply chain; Sustainability","fishery management; performance assessment; policy making; project management; seafood; supply chain management; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049339551

An important question the provider faces under such circumstances is whether or not to perform triage and how to prioritize the patients. By choosing to triage a particular patient, the provider can determine the health condition and thus the urgency of the patient, but that will come at the expense of delaying the actual service (stabilization or initial treatment) for that patient as well as all the other patients. Motivated by this problem, which also arises in other service contexts, we consider a service system where finitely many patients, all available at time zero, belong to one of the two possible triage classes, where each class is characterized by its waiting cost and expected service time. Patients' class identities are initially unknown, but the service provider has the option to spend time on triage to determine the class of a patient. Our objective is to identify policies that balance the time spent on triage with the time spent on service by minimizing the total expected cost.We provide a complete characterization of the optimal dynamic policy and show that the optimal dynamic policy that specifies when to perform triage is determined by a switching curve, and we provide a mathematical expression for this curve. One insight that comes out of this characterization is that the server should start with performing triage when there are sufficiently many patients and never perform triage when there are few patients. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which we demonstrate how one can use our mathematical results to develop policies that can be used in mass-casualty triage and prioritization, and we find that there are substantial benefits to using one of these policies instead of the simpler benchmarks. © 2017 INFORMS.","Clearing system; Markov decision processes; Priority scheduling; Triage","Management; Operations research; Expected service time; Health condition; Initial treatment; Mathematical expressions; Optimal dynamics; Resource restrictions; Service provider; Service systems; Patient treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063412427

We argue that compared to CEOs with longer career horizons, CEOs with shorter career horizons will be less inclined to make real options investments because they may not fully reap the rewards during their tenure. In addition, we argue that long-term incentives and institutional ownership will mitigate the relationship between CEOs’ career horizons and real options investments. U.S. public firms as an empirical setting produced consistent evidence for our predictions. Our study is the first to theoretically explain and empirically show that a CEO's self-seeking behavior will impact real options investments. Managerial Summary: This article helps to explain how a CEO's self seeking-behavior may shape a firm's real option investment, which could result in different level of strategic flexibility. We argue that CEOs with short career horizons have less time to exercise their firms’ real options, which should lower the investments in the firms’ real options portfolios relative to CEOs with long career horizons. We study a sample of U.S. public firms and find strong evidence that a CEO's expected tenure in the firm is positively related to the real options investments at the firm level. We find that this agency issue can be mitigated by adopting appropriate corporate governance mechanisms such as long-term incentives and institutional investors. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agency theory; CEO career horizon; economic short-termism; real options; strategic flexibility","Investments; Agency theory; CEO career horizon; Corporate governance; Institutional investors; Institutional ownerships; Real Options; Self seeking behavior; Strategic flexibility; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052829332

Text communication has been put forth as one solution to addressing this duality of team diversity. Unfortunately, the empirical results have been far from conclusive. We believe that resolving such inconsistencies is crucial to developing a more complete understanding of the use of communication technologies. To accomplish this, we developed a research model based on media synchronicity theory. We empirically tested this model by conducting a laboratory experiment with 46 teams, consisting primarily of men and women self-identified as Caucasians and Asians, performing a decision-making task. The results showthat the type of diversity matters. Text communication improved knowledge sharing (i.e., conveyance) and knowledge integration (i.e., convergence) in racially diverse teams but impaired both in gender diverse teams. Knowledge integration was more important to decision quality when racial and gender diverse teams used text communication (but the importance of knowledge sharing was not affected by the communication medium). © 2018 INFORMS.","Computer mediated communications; Knowledge integration; Knowledge sharing; Media synchronicity theory; Team diversity; Virtual teams","Integration; Knowledge management; Computer mediated communication; Knowledge integration; Knowledge-sharing; Media synchronicities; Team diversity; Virtual team; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056301773

Building on the contingency view of corporate governance, we argue that the presence of significant new entry threats (NET), a unique feature that differentiates the IT industry from many other industries, is a critical contextual variable that moderates this relationship. Leveraging a novel NET measure based on text mining, we show that facing high NET, firms with boards that have a higher proportion of independent directors, who contribute to explorative organizational learning, carry out more effective monitoring, and offer independent opinions in strategic decision making, outperform firms with fewer independent board members. To address the endogeneity of board independence, we use the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related changes to the NYSE/NASDAQ listing rules as exogenous shocks; we show that our results are robust to the correction for endogeneity issues. Further, we show that our findings are generalizable to other high tech industries that face significant threats of new entry emerging from fast-moving industry dynamics. However, these results do not extend to slow-moving industries that have a stable market structure and thereby face lower and more homogenous levels of NET. We discuss the implications for future research, and provide managerial guidelines for practice as well. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Additionally, we tested mediation effects of review rating, depth and delay between membership tiers and review helpfulness, and found that membership tier negatively affected review helpfulness indirectly. Interestingly, reviews posted by high-status customers are perceived as more helpful than those of others when we controlled for review characteristics. This study contributes to research on online product reviews and customer relationship management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Membership tier; Online reviews; Status; User content generation","Behavioral research; Electronic commerce; Online systems; Public relations; Websites; Customer relationship management systems; Empirical analysis; Membership tier; Online data; Online reviews; Online shopping; Review systems; Shopping websites; Status; User content generation; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024486368

In these studies, the size of an average job seeker’s network was much smaller and limited by the available modes of communication and the costs associated with maintaining social connections. However, the recent growth of online social networks has enabled job seekers to stay connected with many connections, weak or strong. Thus, the number of online connections—especially weak—has increased significantly. In this paper, we first examine whether an individual’s social network plays a role in driving job search behavior, taking into account online social networking sites (e.g., LinkedIn) and other job search modes. Second, we examine how ties in online social networks (both weak and strong) a ect job search outcomes (modeled sequentially as job leads, interviews, and offers), and we compare the findings to job outcomes from traditional job search modes (e.g., career fairs, newspaper, Internet postings, and friends and family). To do so, we first construct an economic model of search behavior incorporating cost and benefit functions; we then estimate the model to recover structural parameters using the survey data of 424 users. Our findings show that users are spending more time searching for jobs on social networking sites. In addition, users’ strong ties play a significant role in job search and are especially helpful in generating job leads, interviews, and offers; the weak ties, on average, are ineffective in generating positive outcomes and marginally negative in some cases. © 2017 INFORMS.","Economics of IS; IT policy and management; Job search; LinkedIn; Online ties; Social network; Strong and weak ties","Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Surveys; Economics of is; It policy and managements; Job search; LinkedIn; Online ties; Weak ties; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051362026

This paper aims to explore the effect of personality trait variations (through the Big Five Inventory [BFI]) on users’ risk level of their intended security behaviors. In addition, age, gender, service usage and information technology (IT) proficiency are analyzed to identify what role and impact they have on behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a quantitative-oriented survey that was implemented online. The bi-variate Pearson two-tailed correlation was used to analyze survey responses. Findings: The results obtained by analyzing 538 survey responses suggest that personality traits do play a significant role in affecting users’ security behavior risk levels. Furthermore, the results suggest that BFI score of a trait has a significant effect as users’ online personality is linked to their offline personality, especially in the conscientiousness personality trait. Additionally, this effect was stronger when personality was correlated with the factors of IT proficiency, gender, age and online activity. Originality/value: The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, with the aid of a large population sample, end-users’ security practice is assessed from multiple domains, and relationships were found between end-users’ risk-taking behavior and nine user-centric factors. Second, based upon these findings, the predictive ability for these user-centric factors were evaluated to determine the level of risk a user is subject to from an individual behavior perspective. Of 28 behaviors, 11 were found to have a 60 per cent or greater predictive ability, with the highest classification of 92 per cent for several behaviors. This provides a basis for organizations to use behavioral intent alongside personality traits and demographics to understand and, therefore, manage the human aspects of risk. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Information security modelling; Risk analysis","Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Individual behavior; Large population; Online activities; Personality traits; Predictive abilities; Risk-taking behaviors; Security Practice; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051288068

Strategic value alignment is a proactive approach to manage value conflict in information security management. Applying a critical success factor (CSF) analysis approach, this paper aims to propose a CSF model based on a strategic alignment approach and test a model of the main factors that contributes to the success of information security management. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was proposed and empirically tested with data collected from a survey of managers who were involved in decision-making regarding their companies’ information security (N = 219). The research model was validated using partial least squares structural equation modeling approach. Findings: Overall, the model was successful in capturing the main antecedents of information security management performance. The results suggest that with business alignment, top management support and organizational awareness of security risks and controls, effective information security controls can be developed, resulting in successful information security management. Originality/value: Findings from this study provide several important contributions to both theory and practice.

Yet despite their substantial investments in services, firms fail to understand the performance ramifications of these offerings. With a longitudinal data set (2001–2016) of 227 B2B manufacturers listed in the S&P 1500 index, this study disentangles the simultaneous effects of financial-based mechanisms that link the service ratio (i.e., share of a firm's revenue generated from selling services) to firm value. The findings reveal significant trade-offs across these mechanisms. Although the service ratio monotonously boosts sales growth, it has U-shaped curvilinear relationships with profitability and earnings volatility. These effects also depend on industry- and firm-level factors. Industry maturity positively moderates the effects of the service ratio on sales growth and profitability. However, business scope has an adverse effect on the service ratio–profitability relationship. Finally, industry turbulence negatively moderates the effect of services on earnings volatility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","B2B services marketing; Earnings volatility; Profitability; Sales growth; Service ratio; Tobin's q",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041340903

Inconsistency within a set of pairwise comparisons has adverse effects upon the accuracy of the preferences derived from them. Inconsistency within pairwise comparisons is almost inevitable, hence consideration of its reduction is essential. This paper presents INSITE, an approach to inconsistency reduction within a set of pairwise comparisons via multi-objective optimisation. When seeking to reduce inconsistency within a set of pairwise comparisons there is a trade-off between alteration to the comparisons and the reduction of inconsistency within them. For such trade-offs no trade-off solution is superior per se to the others. Therefore, INSITE seeks to optimally reduce inconsistency within a set of comparisons by modelling inconsistency and alteration as separate objectives. In this way the nature of the trade-offs between inconsistency reduction and alteration are revealed, thus better informing a decision maker's awareness and knowledge of the problem and increasing validity of outcomes by providing a more evidential, transparent, auditable and traceable process. In this way a decision maker can look to make a more informed choice of the level of trade-off that is most suitable for them. INSITE is flexible regarding how inconsistency within judgments is measured; alteration to a decision maker's views is modelled via fine-grained measures of compromise that seek to be meaningful and relevant. Furthermore, the approach allows a decision maker to set constraints on both inconsistency and measures of compromise objectives. © 2017","Analytic hierarchy process; Inconsistency; Multi criteria analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Pairwise comparisons","Analytic hierarchy process; Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Decision maker's preferences; Inconsistency; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Pair-wise comparison; Separation of concerns; Set constraints; Tradeoff solution; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038879116

In our setting, a retailer offers a supplier contract terms for a product, where the product can be low or high quality. The supplier can choose to exert high effort, which is costly but guarantees high quality, or low effort, which does not assure high quality with certainty. We compare how monetary incentives, such as a bonus that is paid to the supplier when high quality is received by the retailer, and relational incentives, such as the two parties engaging in a long-term relationship where there is the threat of punishment, affect overall quality and supply chain efficiency. Two of our primary results suggest that (1) relational incentives improve both quality and supply chain efficiency, regardless of whether a monetary incentive is present, and (2) when relational incentives are present, the impact of adding monetary incentives is nonmonotonic: less efficient monetary incentives appear to crowd out the benefits of relational incentives leading even to a reduction in supply chain efficiency, whereas more efficient monetary incentives actually complement relational incentives and lead to significant increases in both quality and supply chain efficiency.

Both recurrent and vector forecasting algorithms of horizontal MSSA (HMSSA) are considered. The results from the proposed multivariate approach are compared with those obtained via the optimized univariate singular spectrum analysis (SSA) forecasting algorithm to determine the statistical significance of each outcome. The data are rigorously tested for normality, seasonal unit root hypothesis, and structural breaks. The results are presented such that users can not only identify the most appropriate model based on the aim of the analysis, but also easily identify the leading indicators for each IP variable in each country. Our findings show that, for all three countries, forecasts from the proposed MSSA algorithm outperform the optimized SSA algorithm in over 70% of cases. Accordingly, this new approach succeeds in identifying leading indicators and is a viable option for selecting the SSA choices L and r, which minimizes a loss function.

However, the theoretical foundations for secrecy have not been well explored. We extend knowledge protection literature and propose theoretical mechanisms explaining how information visibility influences the importance of secrecy as a knowledge protection instrument. Building on mechanisms from information economics and signaling theory, we postulate that secrecy is more important for protecting knowledge for firms that have legal requirements to reveal information to shareholders. Furthermore, we argue that this effect is contingent on the location in a technological cluster, on a firm's investment in fixed assets and on a firm's past innovation performance. We test our hypotheses using a representative sample of 683 firms in Germany between 2005 and 2013. Our results support the moderation effect of a technological cluster and a firm's investment in fixed assets.

Yet the lack of fast computational methods for frontier of cardinality constrained portfolio investments makes the performance evaluation of this problem a long-standing challenge. Classic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models have been justified valid in evaluating and ranking portfolio performance. Unfortunately, when it comes to the cardinality constrained portfolio selection problem, the DEA models fail to approximate the portfolio efficiency (PE) since the real frontier is discontinuous and not concave. To solve this problem, we propose a segmented DEA approach based on data segment points. A searching algorithm is introduced to approach the real segment points and proved to be valid. In each segment, the frontier is continuous and concave; hence, classic DEA models can be applied to evaluate the PE. The simulation results further indicate that the segmented DEA approach proposed in this paper is effective and practical in evaluating the cardinality constrained portfolio performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cardinality constrained portfolio selection; Data envelopment analysis; Performance evaluation","simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020096513

If retailer orders exceed supplier capacity, a proportional rationing rule applies to capacity allocation among retailers. We propose a behavior model based on cognitive hierarchy theory, in which retailers with different levels of strategic-reasoning capabilities form heterogeneous beliefs about other players' capabilities when choosing their orders. This behavioral model yields three interesting predictions. First, retailers' orders increase as the number of retailers decreases or the supplier's production capacity shrinks. Second, the orders tend to increase as the retailer population becomes more ""sophisticated."" Third, retailers' profits first increase in relation to their strategic-reasoning capabilities and then decrease, indicating an inverted U-shaped relationship between profits and strategic-reasoning capabilities. We experimentally examine the capacity allocation game with participants motivated by financial incentives.

In this study, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian learning model to examine the impact of social learning, through both targeted early adopter effects and general peer effects, and experiential learning on the information technology implementation process by physicians in a community health system. Our unique data allow us to disentangle the most common and challenging endogeneity issues associated with most social influence studies. We find that the experiential learning signal is more accurate than the social learning signals in the technology implementation process; and, between the two types of social learning signals studied here, targeted early adopter effects are much more informative than general peer effects. Furthermore, we experiment with several policy simulations to illustrate and quantify the two different types of social influence on this implementation process. The simulation results suggest that maintaining consistency in technology usage by targeted early adopters is more effective than increasing the frequency of their technology usage in reducing their colleagues' perceptions of uncertainty about the new technology. More specifically, we find that technology implementation probability would increase: (a) by 15%, on average, by adding a targeted early adopter to a group without early adopters; (b) by 25% by adding peer effects to solo users; and (c) by 47% by adding early adopter effects to solo users. The model can be adapted and generalized to other similar settings that examine social influence on the technology implementation process and also provide quantifiable measures of the improvements that the interventions may produce. © 2017 INFORMS.","Bayesian learning; Early adopter effects; Experiential learning; Information technology implementation; Peer effects; Social influence; Social learning","Engineering education; Bayesian learning; Early adopter effects; Experiential learning; Information technology implementations; Peer effects; Social influence; Social learning; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043975170

Whereas individual creativity thrives on novel combinations of diverse knowledge and perspectives, we argue that the characteristics of strategic decisions influence the extent to which employees’ combinatory activities enhance their creativity. Multilevel modeling results based on 638 employees from 34 organizations show that the positive relationship between tertius iungens (TI) orientation and creative performance is reinforced by strategic decision comprehensiveness, especially when coupled with low strategic decision speed. The results suggest that, paradoxically, when top managers consider a narrower range of options and act more quickly to respond to challenges in the external environment, they risk constraining creative processes within the organization. Managerial Summary: To innovate, managers are often advised to make strategic decisions based on changes in their external business environment. Our research suggests that managers should also consider how strategic decision-making enables the social processes through which employees generate creative ideas essential to organizational innovation. Our results show that employees who bring people in their network and their diverse ideas together (i.e., the tertius iungens [TI] orientation) tend to improve creative performance. However, for those employees is it easier to develop creative ideas when strategic decisions are comprehensive and slow? Paradoxically, when top managers consider a narrower range of options and act more quickly to respond to challenges in the external environment, they risk constraining the social processes that lead to creativity within the organization.

Using a model of an electronic marketplace in which two competing manufacturers sell their products through a common retail platform, we study the effect of recommender systems on the retail platform, manufacturers, consumer surplus, and social welfare. In our setting, consumers are differentiated with respect to their preference for the two products (locational differentiation) and awareness about the two products (informational differentiation). A recommender system selects the recommendation based on a recommendation score, which is a weighted sum of expected retailer profit and expected consumer value. We find that the recommender system may benefit or hurt the retailer and the manufacturers depending on the signs and magnitudes of the substitution effect and demand effect of the recommender system. The substitution effect of the recommender system either intensifies or softens the price competition between two manufacturers through two forces-its direct influence alters the informational differentiation of consumers (which affects the markup that manufacturers can charge), and its strategic influence motivates the manufacturers to use price as a lever to attract more recommendations in their favor. The demand effect of the recommender system increases overall consumer awareness, but, depending on the substitution effect, may increase or decrease the demand. The recommendation strategy, namely, the relative weight assigned to retailer profit vis-á-vis consumer value in computing the recommendation score, along with recommender system precision and the relative sizes of segments of consumers with different awareness levels, determines whether the retailer benefits from the recommender system and by how much. We find that the retailer's optimal recommendation strategy is mildly profit oriented in the sense that it assigns a larger, but not too large, weight to retailer profit compared to consumer value, and that under the optimal strategy, the price competition is less intense and the retailer profit is higher compared to when there is no recommender system. Furthermore, an increase in either the recommender system precision or the fraction of consumers that are aware of at least one product induces the retailer to adopt a more profit-oriented recommendation strategy. © 2018 INFORMS.","Analytical modeling; Economics of IS; Electronic commerce; Recommender system","Analytical models; Competition; Electronic commerce; Manufacture; Profitability; Sales; Consumer awareness; Consumer surplus; Economics of is; Electronic marketplaces; Optimal strategies; Price competition; Recommendation strategies; Substitution effect; Recommender systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062152132

Could an energy labeling requirement for residential real estate help? We propose that the salient color-letter grades on the English Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) served as targets, motivating vendors to invest in energy efficiency. To test our hypothesis we look to a random sample of over 16,000 homes in England. In the post-EPC data we find a cluster of homes with energy efficiency scores just above the D-grade threshold. This cluster was not present prior to the requirement, replicates in an independently-drawn random sample and is significantly larger amongst properties that can be identified as treated by the EPC requirement. We conclude that the EPC requirement induced investment, and hence that energy efficiency labels have potential to green the housing stock. We infer from our analysis how the design of the EPC could be altered to motivate greater investment in energy efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy efficiency gap; Energy labels; Notches; Residential energy use; Retrofitting; Selective attention","Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Labels; Retrofitting; Energy labels; Energy-efficiency gaps; Notches; Residential energy; Selective attention; Energy efficiency; energy efficiency; energy market; hypothesis testing; performance assessment; residential energy; technology adoption; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040780337

As a motivating application we price continuously monitored barrier options with the underlying asset modelled by an exponential Lévy process. We perform a detailed error analysis of the method and develop error bounds to show how the performance is limited by the truncation error of the sinc-based fast Hilbert transform used for the Wiener–Hopf factorisation. By comparing the results for our new technique with those for the discretely monitored case (which is in the Fourier-z domain) as the monitoring time step approaches zero, we show that the error convergence with continuous monitoring represents a limit for the discretely monitored scheme. © 2018","Finance; Hilbert transform; Laplace transform; Option pricing; Spectral filter; Wiener–Hopf factorisation","Costs; Economics; Error analysis; Factorization; Finance; Fourier transforms; Inverse problems; Inverse transforms; Monitoring; Numerical methods; Continuous monitoring; Error convergence; Hilbert transform; Numerical inverse transform; Numerical scheme; Option pricing; Spectral filters; Truncation errors; Laplace transforms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048161849

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the individual and macro-level factors influencing the allocation of time to volunteer at sport events. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from volunteers at 25 sport events (n=2,303). Multi-level modelling was used to identify common effects controlling for event differences. Findings: Male gender significantly influences time allocated to an event at the individual level. At the macro-level, the number of local inhabitants has a significant negative effect whereas the status of an international event and duration contribute positively to time allocation. Research limitations/implications: The results provide clear evidence that macro-level variables can stimulate interest in event volunteering opportunities.

Similarly, using commercial databases, I find that hedge funds with greater exposure to a liquidity provision factor earn significantly higher excess returns and Sharpe ratios. The superior performance of liquidity-supplying hedge funds arises from strategies that are more complex than mechanical short-term reversal strategies. For example, among stocks with similar past returns, liquidity-supplying funds are more likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by constrained mutual funds and less likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by unconstrained mutual funds. The outperformance of liquiditysupplying funds is also concentrated in periods of low funding liquidity, suggesting that less-binding financial constraints contribute to their superior returns. © 2017 INFORMS.","Fund performance; Hedge funds; Liquidity provision","Commerce; Investments; Wooden fences; Excess returns; Financial constraints; Fund performance; Hedge Funds; Liquidity provisions; Mutual funds; Sharpe ratios; Transaction data; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049384999

Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore existing patterns of Lean and Six Sigma implementation in U.S. hospitals and compare the performance of the different patterns. Methodology/Approach: We collected data from 215 U.S. hospitals via a survey that includes measurement items developed from related literature. Using the cross-sectional data, we conducted a cluster analysis, followed by t tests, chi-square tests, and regression analyses for cluster verification. Results: The cluster analysis identifies two clusters, a Moderate Six Sigma group and a Lean Six Sigma group. Results show that the Lean Six Sigma group outperforms the Moderate Six Sigma group across many performance dimensions: Responsiveness capability, patient safety, and possibly cost saving. In addition, the Lean Six Sigma group tends to be composed of larger, private teaching hospitals located in more urban areas, and they employ more resources for quality improvement. Conclusion: Our research contributes to the quality management literature by supporting the possible complementary relationship between Lean and Six Sigma in hospitals. Practice Implications: Our study encourages practitioners and managers to pay more attention to Lean implementation. Although Lean seems to be conducted in a limited fashion in many hospitals, it should be expanded and combined with Six Sigma for better results. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

First, portfolios of electricity generation technologies that comprise the energy supply systems in the US are evaluated using a mean-variance approach. Second, this research assesses the reliability of the portfolios with the aid of loss of load expectation and loss of energy expectation metrics. The methodology considers the least-cost technology mix coupled with the reduction of market and system risks. The variation in the portfolio cost is based on the prevailing policies in the geographic locations. Overall, the current mix of technologies evaluated along the cost-risk latitudes shows an inefficient electricity technology portfolio system. First, investments in renewable technologies may create a bifurcation. On the one hand, the portfolios with significant proportions of the high-cost intermittent technologies exhibit low market risks. On the other hand, these portfolios have less desirable system reliability measures. Second, policy makers will find it instructive that a more diverse electricity technology mix offers the potential to migrate to the efficient frontier in the near term. However, it is imperative to craft policies in support of the transition with the caveat that technology diversity is not always a panacea for improving system reliability even if the portfolio is on the efficient frontier.

In theory, a number of different contracts can solve this issue and induce first-best investment levels by the supplier. In this study, we investigate the performance of these contracts in a two-tier supply chain. We develop an experimental design where retailers and suppliers bargain over contract terms-and have the ability to make multiple back-and-forth offers-while also providing feedback on the offers they receive. One key result from our study is that an option contract and a service-level agreement are best at increasing first-best investment levels and overall supply chain profits. However, these same contracts also generate the largest inequity in expected profits between the two parties. We find that both of these results are driven by the bargaining tendencies of retailers and suppliers, which we refer to as ""superficial fairness."" In particular, retailers and suppliers place more emphasis on negotiating the wholesale price, while partially overlooking any secondary parameter, such that final wholesale prices end up roughly halfway between the retailer's selling price and the supplier's production cost. We show that this bargaining behavior contributes to higher investment levels observed in the option contract and service-level agreement, along with the inequitable payoffs.

We test our hypotheses in the U.S. credit union industry, in which credit unions offer a variety of loan and deposit products through a variety of online and offline channels, including physical branches, ATMs, telephone banking, online banking, and mobile banking. By analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 7577 credit unions in 2009–2016, the study provides empirical evidence that operating a full spectrum of online and offline channels leads to higher profitability and lower profit volatility for credit unions. The study also reveals differential moderating effects of loan product diversity and deposit product diversity, in that loan product diversity enhances the profit-enhancing effect of channel diversity while deposit product diversity enhances the volatility-suppressing effect of channel diversity.

Covering some 1.35 million hectares or about 25% of the country's arable area, agricultural estates are an important part of Malawi's rural economy. However, the analysis shows that 70% of these estates have expired leases, reducing government revenue from ground rent by up to US$35 million or 5% of the total public spending annually. The low quality of spatial records, as indicated by the fact that some 140,000 hectares under estates are subject to overlapping claims could preclude the land market participation, especially under longer-term contracts. Data from a 2006/07 survey suggest that estates’ yield, productivity, and intensity of land use are below those of small farms. While the recently passed land laws create a basis for low-cost systematic demarcation and registration of rights to customary land, our analysis suggests that, to maximize their likely contribution to increasing productivity and welfare rather than conflict, such efforts need to be preceded by a clarification of boundaries and lease status of existing estates and ideally a more detailed study of the reasons underpinning the low productivity. © 2017 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank","Africa; Computerized lease; Estate; Malawi; Productivity","investment; land market; land use; performance assessment; productivity; public spending; satellite imagery; Malawi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044645992

We evaluate the performance of inflation forecasts based on the single-equation forecasting specification implied by the model, exploiting the spatial pattern of international linkages underpinning global inflation. We find that incorporating cross-country interactions yields significantly more accurate forecasts of local inflation for a diverse group of 14 advanced countries (including the U.S.) than either a simple autoregressive model or a standard closed-economy Phillips curve-based forecasting model. We argue that modeling the temporal dimension—but not the cross-country spillovers—of inflation does limit a model's explanatory power in-sample and its (pseudo) out-of-sample forecasting performance. Moreover, we also show that global inflation (without domestic slack) often contributes the most to achieve the gains on forecasting accuracy observed during our sample period (1984:Q1-2015:Q1)—this observation, according to theory, is crucially related to the flattening of the Phillips curve during this time period of increased globalization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; Inflation dynamics; Open-economy Phillips curve",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040565836

Knowing, a priori, whether a tenant will pay the rent on time, be able to hold a good relationship with the neighbors or take care of the property (i.e. whether s/he will be a “good” tenant) is not a simple endeavor. It is crucial, however, as it can help save time, money and conflicts that can end up in court. This study aims to address this issue, through the integrated use of cognitive maps and the Decision EXpert (DEX) technique. Grounded on a constructivist logic, the study brought together a panel of experts with experience and knowledge in the residential rental market, in order to identify and articulate the criteria to be taken into account in the classification and selection of tenants. The results achieved show that the integration of these two methodologies (i.e. cognitive maps and DEX) can help increase our understanding of the decision problem at hand, and lead to more informed and potentially better tenant choices.

Based on a radical innovation project at Jaguar (UK), we contribute to a process and temporal perspective of open innovation by shedding light on two core project processes and their enabling mechanisms which influenced the ability of Jaguar to maximize profits from the innovation. The first core project process was the choice of timing of the shift from a closed to an open model of innovation: it was enabled by a pro-active change in the formal defense strategy (i.e. submission of a patent), and by an internal loose coupling project strategy that involved autonomy of the project champion and internal engineers’ weak membership in the project. The second core process was an external loose coupling project strategy that was enabled by the deployment of two complementary informal appropriation mechanisms namely, the reduction of the scope of tasks allocated to external partners combined with the development of guarded relationships with them. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Appropriation strategy; Open innovation; Radical innovation project; Timing of openness","Network security; Profitability; Timing circuits; Appropriation strategy; Defense mechanism; Defense strategy; Open innovation; Project champions; Project strategy; Radical innovation; Timing of openness; Patents and inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051367650

To bridge the knowledge gap about how firm size affects innovation in construction, the purpose of this paper is to explore firm-level innovation through an empirical investigation and compare innovation in construction firms of different sizes in terms of drivers and strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a combination of a literature review, a group of qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire survey. In this research, the questionnaire survey is the main instrument to collect empirical data. Main contractors, subcontractors and specialist contractors as well as suppliers of labor, material and equipment are used in this research to represent construction firms of different sizes. On the other hand, client organizations, design firms and management consultants are not included in this research. Findings: This research provides clear evidence for the embrace of innovation in construction. Many forces can drive construction firms to innovate and many strategies can be applied to construction innovation. Innovation drivers can be either internal or external. On the other hand, innovation strategies fall into four categories: technology, resource, marketing and management. For innovation drivers and strategies, both commonalities and differences can be found among construction firms of different sizes. Originality/value: The finding of commonalities describes the general trend of innovation development in construction. It also encourages all construction firms to innovate regardless of firm size. On the other hand, the finding of differences enables construction firms of different sizes to realize what forces better drive their innovation and what strategies are more appropriate for their innovation. A thorough understanding of innovation drivers and strategies offers an important framework for construction organizations and practitioners to pursue best practice. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Innovation; Strategic management","Construction; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Contractors; Digital storage; Surveys; Construction innovation; Construction organizations; Design/methodology/approach; Empirical investigation; Innovation in construction; Management consultants; Specialist contractors; Strategic management; Bridges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053045509

Vibration is perceived by cyclists as one of the most important indicators of cycling comfort, and it greatly influences people's choice of bicycles. However, a comprehensive correlation between cyclists’ perception of comfort and cycling vibration has not yet been established in the current knowledge. In this study, a total of 46 sections of 24 urban roads (approximately 11,500m in length of asphalt pavements) in the city of Xi'an, China, were selected for field test. An innovative Dynamic Cycling Comfort (DCC) measure system consisting of an accelerometer, GPS logger and smart phone, was installed on the hand bar of a shared bicycle typically used in Xi'an, to record the dynamic data of vibration, trail, speed and mileage. Reliability of the DCC was verified, and the effect of test conditions (speed, bicycle type) on vibration evaluated. The vibration data were processed in accordance with ISO 2631 to quantitatively characterize the vibration level on each tested section. Furthermore, a total of 17 volunteers participated in this test, and the cyclists’ perception of vibration in each section was obtained via a purpose-designed questionnaire. The volunteers’ perception of environmental factors such as scenery, weather, road geometry, congestion and traffic condition were summarized to evaluate the influencing factors for cycling comfort. The thresholds of acceptable rate, comfort level and vibration perceptible level were established, based on the correlation between cycling vibration awv and subjective perception described in the questionnaire. In addition, the cycling comfort on the asphalt pavements (3521 m) within Qujiangchi Park was mapped, to demonstrate the practical use of this study. Results showed that the DCC is able to capture the cycling data timely and accurately. K-means clustering analysis showed that the cycling vibration increases with the increase of cycling speed. Meantime, a heavier shared bicycle with solid tires results in higher cycling vibration compared with a lighter one with inflatable tires. In addition, the comfort level is proportional to acceptable rate, and inversely proportional to vibration perceptible level. The cycling comfort mapping for Qujiangchi Park proved that there is great potential to use the vibration (comfort) data to monitor pavement surface quality and for cyclists to determine their desirable cycling route. Results of this study should be interested by cyclists, bicycle manufacturers, transport planners and road authorities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cycling comfort; Perception of vibration; Shared bicycle; Urban roads","Air quality; Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Bicycles; Smartphones; Sporting goods; Surveys; Traffic congestion; Cycling comfort; Environmental factors; K-means clustering analysis; Social and environmental; Subjective perceptions; Traffic conditions; Transport planners; Urban road; Vibration analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048199344

Based on point and density forecast accuracy measures, as well as on equal predictive ability (EPA) and superior predictive ability (SPA) tests, we evaluate the relative forecasting performance of different model specifications over the quarterly period of 1919:Q2 until 2014:Q4.

We also find that the EPU exhibits similar forecasting ability to the term spread and outperforms other uncertainty measures such as the volatility index and geopolitical risk in predicting US recessions. While the Markov switching time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model yields the lowest values for the root mean squared error in most cases, we observe relatively low values for the log predictive density score, when using the Bayesian vector regression model with stochastic volatility. More importantly, our results highlight the importance of uncertainty in forecasting US GNP growth rates.

The Voronoi diagram has proven to be an important mathematical and geometric construct and has been widely applied in various fields because it is intuitive and efficient in the allocation and/or partitioning of space. However, existing Voronoi diagram approaches rely on the assumption that the attribute(s) of continuous space (non-generator points) is homogenous, which often is not the case for many application contexts. This paper introduces the concept of spatial heterogeneity in allocation. A new Voronoi diagram is defined—the heterogeneous Voronoi diagram. A geographic information system-based method is developed to derive the heterogeneous Voronoi diagram using discretized spatial allocation properties. Application of the heterogeneous Voronoi diagram is reported for a planning problem involving emergency drone delivery. Results show that response potential is over- and underestimated when heterogeneity and travel obstacles are disregarded. Further, feasibility, usefulness, and significance are demonstrated for incorporating geographic heterogeneity in the allocation process. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Allocation; Spatial heterogeneity; Voronoi diagram","GIS; heterogeneity; location-allocation model; mathematical analysis; numerical model; planning process; spatial analysis; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049869286

This article investigates a duality in the exploratory component of R &D activity with regard to innovation failure: while exploration is likely to increase firms' exposure to failure, it might also provide learning opportunities to reduce failure. Our study contributes to the innovation management and organizational learning literatures by demonstrating the value of exploratory R &D for enabling two types of learning mechanisms. The first, experience-based learning, is based on the learning opportunities derived from accumulated experience in exploratory R &D: it involves improvements to procedures associated with experimentation and provides guidance for current exploration and to navigate the search space. The second, inferential-based learning, is based on the learning opportunities derived from current exploratory R &D efforts, which are associated with improved interpretation of ill-defined problems and timely responses to unstructured information. We draw on a longitudinal data set of 2226 Spanish manufacturing companies and show that, when past experience is associated with current exploration, innovation failure in the conception phase is reduced. We also find an inverted Ushaped relation between current exploratory R &D and innovation failure, in both the conception and implementation phases of innovation activities, showing that increasing levels of investment in current exploration activities attenuate the initial positive association between exploratory R &D and failure. © The Author 2017.

Supply chains become vulnerable due to natural and man-made catastrophes and due to ineffectiveness in operations. Contracts form the basis for communication and relationship management between a buyer and a supplier. We provide an analytical framework that addresses supply chain effectiveness (costs, risks, transaction costs, stakeholder issues) and would help inform managers who grapple with such concerns. We propose three factors (costs, benefits, and risks) that capture the objective nature and one parameter that deals with the subjective nature of sustainable contracts. To illustrate the framework we collect representative cost (objective) data from suppliers, integrate behavioral (subjective) elements, and employ constrained optimization techniques to compare five supplier-engagement contract policies. We then refine this cost-based solution, for a given contract policy, to develop three cost-benefit-risk trade-off formulations and illustrate them using simulated data. The framework addresses supplier and network-based externalities, supplier and network level effectiveness, and transaction costs, and thus provides a mechanism to enable a coordinator-driven sustainable supply network. The analysis informs contract development and evaluation process and helps align buyer-supplier interest in the long-run. We believe the analysis will help build sustainable buyer-supplier relations. Network coordinators who would benefit from our framework include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers (say tier-1 suppliers in automotive industry), retailers (especially as retailers pursue private labels and become more involved in manufacturing and branding), etc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Automotive industry; Commerce; Constrained optimization; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chains; Buyer-supplier relations; Constrained optimization techniques; Distribution centers; Network coordinators; Original equipment manufacturers; Relationship management; Supply-chain effectiveness; Sustainable supply chains; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045105816

In this choice model, a customer arrives into the system to purchase a certain product. If this product is available for purchase, then the customer purchases it. Otherwise, the customer transitions between the products according to a transition probability matrix until she reaches an available one and purchases this product. The parameters of the Markov chain choice model are the probability that the customer arrives into the system to purchase each one of the products and the entries of the transition probability matrix. In our expectation-maximization algorithm, we treat the path that a customer follows in the Markov chain as the missing piece of the data. Conditional on the final purchase decision of a customer, we show how to compute the probability that the customer arrives into the system to purchase a certain product and the expected number of times that the customer transitions from a certain product to another one. These results allow us to execute the expectation step of our algorithm. Also, we show how to solve the optimization problem that appears in the maximization step of our algorithm.

Using theoretical arguments set forth by the Convergence and Divergence Hypotheses in industrial economics, this study develops a series of hypotheses about the effects of country, consumer pressure, community pressure, and resource availability on managers' environmental investment decisions. Using a random assignment factorial survey experiment (FSE) that combines vignettes and questionnaires, it compares responses from managers in developing countries (349 managers from Brazil, China, and India) and those from developed countries (377 managers from Germany and USA). Results suggest that, given the same situation, developing country managers raise their investments to a lesser extent in response to consumer pressures, when compared to developed country managers. When community pressure moderates consumer pressure, developing country managers make notably larger investments. Greater availability of resources does not affect developing country managers' investment level contrary to developed country managers. © 2017","Corporate environmental investments; Developing countries; Factorial survey experiment; Resource availability; Stakeholder pressure","Decision making; Developing countries; Industrial economics; Investments; Managers; Surveys; Cross-national; Developed countries; Environmental investments; Managerial decision making; Random assignment; Resource availability; Stakeholder pressures; Theoretical arguments; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042680832

We then analyze welfare aspects to provide insights on the impacts of industry regulations and policy on users, publisher websites, and third parties. We partially validate the model using an exploratory empirical analysis of publisher website third party sharing behavior and the structure of the industry.

However, their predictions are at times contradictory and there is relatively little empirical evidence with which to evaluate them. We therefore develop an integrated, multiperiod model of the optimal number of suppliers that combines search and coordination theory, transaction cost economics, and incomplete contracts theory, and we assess our theoretical predictions using a large new data set on the global IT sourcing decisions of 1,355 firms in 12 countries. Our empirical results support three key predictions about trust, IT, and supply base size. First, investments in coordination IT, which reduce search and coordination costs, are correlated with using more suppliers, while use of vendor-specific IT is associated with fewer suppliers. Second, repeated relationships and trust play a major role in supply chain governance. As firms work with fewer suppliers, they also engage in more repeated relationships. At the same time asset specificity and the need to induce relationship-specific investments are correlated not only with fewer suppliers, but also with a larger fraction of repeated relationships. Third, supply chain governance differs in human capital-intensive and physical capital-intensive industries.

The index’s empirical validity is examined by investigating the strength of its relationship with certain behavioral responses such as patient satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a stratified random sampling from eight hospital outpatient departments in Greece. Covariance-based structural equation modeling techniques were used to validate the proposed service quality index and further investigate its effect on patient satisfaction and behavioral intention. Findings: The data analysis indicated that the proposed formative index is fully functional with medical care being the factor and mostly contributes to service quality perception, followed by administrative service and staff performance, and facilities condition and nursing care. It, further, confirmed the partial mediating role of satisfaction, as it enhances the high impact of service quality on behavioral intentions. Research limitations/implications: The relationships among hospital outpatient departments service quality, patient satisfaction and behavioral intentions were validated with data from one country and a health-care system which is state driven and funded. Practical implications: An understanding of hospital primary health-care service quality formation is important to health-care decision makers because it offers them the opportunity to consider patients’ needs and wants, and takes the appropriate actions for improving the relevant underling procedures in a more efficient manner to achieve favorable behavioral responses. Originality/value: The paper manages to propose and empirically evaluate a formatively measured approach of service quality and investigate the effects of the proposed index on patient satisfaction and behavioral intention, especially in the hospital outpatient services context in Greece. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intentions; Efficiency; Facilities condition; Formative measurement; Hospital outpatient services; Medical care; Nursing care; Patient satisfaction; Satisfaction; Service quality; Services management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048069311

Given the important role that national defense has played in the development of the state, it seems as though this would imply some relationship between military expenditures and economic development. However, there is no consensus on the direction of the relationship between military expenditures and economic growth. In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle. We argue that military technology is a limiting factor for wealth (and therefore capital) accumulation. Since wealth must be protected from plunder and/or destruction, the amount of wealth that can be accumulated is constrained by a society's ability to adequately defend it. We present a theoretical model consistent with this idea and perform a Monte Carlo experiment to determine the implications of this hypothesis for empirical work. We find that the long-run relationship between military expenditures and private production is positive. However, in sample sizes consistent with existing data, the relationship is ambiguous. As a result, we provide support for this idea by relying on historical examples consistent with our hypothesis. Finally, we consider the implications of our hypothesis for the development of state capacity. © 2018","Economic growth; Military technology; National defense",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053192013

Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot-hand literature, which has generally found either no hot hand or a very weak hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this di erence is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents su cient opportunity for transferring defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players, whereas baseball does not. We then develop a method to test whether baseball teams do respond appropriately to hot opponents. Our results suggest teams respond in a manner consistent with drawing correct inference about the magnitude of the hot hand except for a tendency to overreact to very recent performance (i.e., the last five attempts). © 2017 INFORMS.","Behavioral economics; Hot-hand fallacy; Sports economics; Streakiness","Economics; Behavioral economics; Hot hand; Panel data; Recent performance; Shooting probabilities; Short term; Standard deviation; Streakiness; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056330205

However, knowledge development within BIM management is lagging behind its implementation. This study initiates a BIM management-based framework involving BIM climate, which is measured by individual BIM practitioners' perceptions. Subgroup comparison is highlighted in measuring perceptions. Regional variance in BIM climate is addressed in applying the framework by adopting an empirical case study within the context of China's AEC industry. The case study uses Shanghai and Wenzhou, which represent a BIM-leading metropolitan city and a BIM-developing counterpart, respectively, for the comparative analysis of BIM climate. Based on data collected from a questionnaire survey sent to BIM practitioners from these two cities, it is revealed that Shanghai, as the BIM-leading city in China, has somewhat significant differences in BIM climate compared with Wenzhou. For example, Shanghai BIM practitioners perceive fewer challenges in BIM training, but higher risk in adopting BIM technology. This study contributes to both academic work and practice in BIM based on its initiation of the concept of BIM climate and the case study of BIM-climate comparison. Academically, this holistic study proposes the BIM management-related knowledge framework aiming to fill the knowledge gap in BIM climate and culture, and it could be further applied in subclimates and subcultures within BIM. Practically, the case study provides insights to stakeholders regarding regional variations in BIM climate when promoting BIM practice or establishing BIM guidelines. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Analogical study; BIM climate; BIM culture; BIM management; Building information modelling (BIM); Digital technologies","Surveys; Analogical study; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; BIM climate; Building Information Modelling; Digital technologies; Empirical case studies; Knowledge development; Questionnaire surveys; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053311553

We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure bank efficiency and the Brockett and Golany (1996) test to identify group-based differences in efficiency. Our results indicate a gradual convergence process in efficiency between the banks of the core and periphery countries up to 2008. This process is reversed with the escalation of the financial crisis from 2009 to 2012 and the pattern of bank performance becomes asymmetric. Moreover, our findings suggest a more benign impact of the crisis on the core banks, which anyway outperform peripheral banks throughout the period considered. © 2018","Bank efficiency; Convergence; Core-periphery; Data envelopment analysis; Financial crisis; Mann-Whitney rank statistic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050295735

Four wastewater treatment scenarios were compared for produced water management in the Barnett region. For each scenario, the cradle-to-gate life cycle global warming potential and water scarcity footprint was estimated per mega joule of gas produced. The results show a trade-off between water and carbon impacts, because energy is required for treatment of water. A reduction of 49 percent in total water consumed or a 28 percent reduction in the water scarcity footprint in the shale gas production process can be achieved at a cost of a 38 percent increase in global warming potential, if the wastewater management shifted from business as usual to complete desalination and reuse of produced water.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey questionnaire was developed and administered to end-users working in major oil and gas projects. Data collection process was initiated on, around 275 end-users, and 213 responses were received, achieving a high response rate of 77 percent. Findings: The results indicate that both alignment of objectives and end-user’s engagement factors exhibit a positive influence on effectiveness of EPC, with the former having higher contribution than the latter. In this context, the product success triangle reveals higher preference of the end-user’s team toward quality than schedule and cost objectives.

The contention in this paper is that this model is in fact only half complete, for it deals exclusively with the uptake of new technologies rather than their retention or abandonment. Taking the Rogers model as a point of departure, this paper seeks to draw on the literature on nostalgia to characterize consumers who retain a specific technological artefact in the form of the car, then identify business models designed for those consumers. The paper therefore analyses the relatively neglected contribution of extended product lifetimes within circular economies and within the broader concept of socio-technical transitions for sustainability. The relevance of this contribution is that product longevity is one means by which lifestyles characterised by material affluence are reconciled with resource scarcity. Product longevity has the potential to contribute to slowing down the ‘velocity’ of material flows within the circular economy, and hence to the deferment of the investment of further energy (and materials) into the next cycle of consumption. Taking examples from the automotive industry and cars, the paper argues that the ‘post-peak’ (or post-production) retention of technologies may offer insights into both the viability and character of business opportunities, and a possible transition pathway into a post-consumer economy.

One reason for their popularity is the ability for customer service agents to multitask (i.e., interact with multiple customers at a time) thereby increasing the system ""throughput"" and agent productivity. Yet little is known about how multitasking impacts customer satisfaction - The ultimate goal of customer engagements. We address this question using a proprietary data set from an S&P 500 service firm that documents agent multitasking activities (unobservable to customers) in the form of server logs, customer service chat transcripts, and postservice customer surveys. We find that agent multitasking leads to longer in-service delays for customers and lower problem resolution rates. Both lead to lower customer satisfaction, although the impact varies for different customers. Our study is among the first to document the link between multitasking and customer satisfaction, and it has implications for the design of agent time allocation in contact centers and more broadly for howfirms can best manage customer relations in newservice channels enabled by information technology. © 2017 INFORMS.","Customer satisfaction; Information systems; IT policy and management; Multitasking; Service operations","Information management; Information systems; Multitasking; Public relations; Sales; Surveys; Customer relations; Customer services; Customer surveys; It policy and managements; Online customers; Problem resolution; Service operations; Unintended consequences; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047072305

Although it attracts customer traffic, an ill-conceived price promotion has serious repercussions because it disproportionately draws bargain hunters, results in profit erosion and causes operational chaos due to erratic demands. This research proposes a long-term optimization model to help dual channel (click-and-mortar) retailers understand the conditions necessary to promote products online across all markets. When partial markets are recommended, we investigate how to price and select the market portfolio for promotion in each time period. We develop a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve complex and large-scale problems. Both theoretical analysis and numerical study show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional strategy of promoting online across the board. Due to its dynamic nature, the multi-period recurring promotion problem is difficult to address optimally. Our model is capable of planning for multiple periods, multiple markets, and multiple objectives to maximize long term profitability and competitiveness. Click-and-mortar retailers will find our approach extremely effective for maximizing profit, enhancing brand awareness, and improving customer satisfaction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dual-channel retailer; Heuristic algorithm; Online promotion; OR in marketing; Segmented markets","Commerce; Customer satisfaction; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Mortar; Profitability; Sales; Dual channel; Large-scale problem; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiple markets; Multiple-objectives; Online promotion; Optimization modeling; Price promotions; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040104953

The academic researchers often lack motivation to seek entrepreneurial opportunities for their GCIs. They are often discouraged after considering the burden required to convince private investors to finance their GCIs beyond technology readiness level 4. Further, many academic institutions lack a structured framework to bridge the divide between a basic research and viable product. Here we propose a four-pronged approach for developing sustainability performance metrics that can be used by early investors to understand the commercialization prospects of the GCIs: (1) conduct a screening-level LCA of the GCI and simultaneously reduce uncertainties of underlying data and technological readiness; (2) compare the LCA performance of the GCI with similar commercial products in the target market; (3) factor the LCA results into investment evaluation methods; and (4) transform LCA results into indicators that reflect sustainability performance of the innovation. Finally, we present a case study that highlights the use of this approach for developing commercial opportunities for the emerging graphene-composites as corrosion resistant coatings for civil infrastructure applications.

We use a panel of S&P 500 companies from 2004 to 2011 to investigate the addition of foundation board ties by restating firms. CEOs of restating firms add more new foundation board ties than CEOs of non-restating firms, while existing corporate philanthropy and greater corporate reputation diminish this effect. We also find that new ties to foundations boards influences media tenor for restating firms more than it does for non-restating peers. Our study offers a nuanced analysis of the post-crisis actions of restating firms relative to non-restating peers and highlights the relevance of ties to nonprofit boards for corporate governance. Managerial Summary: Firms oftentimes fire their top executives in the aftermath of misconduct, but such response is itself disruptive for the firm's operations. Instead, we suggest that forging ties to independent foundations can help firms in such contexts without unsettling effects. Our results show that, after a restatement event, CEOs of misconduct firms are especially likely to join new foundation boards as trustees and thus seem to be aware of the benefits of these associations. CEOs from firms with existing in-house philanthropy or a high reputation do not join as many new foundations' boards of trustees. We also find that new firm-foundation links are promptly and positively evaluated by the media, thus helping misconduct firms regain social approval.

We found substantial reluctance to bet against the success of preferred U.S. Presidential candidates and Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball, andNCAA hockey teams. This reluctancewas not attributable to optimism or a general aversion to hedging. Reluctance to hedge desired outcomes stemmed from identity signaling, a desire to preserve an important aspect of the bettor's identity. Reluctance to hedge occurred when the diagnostic cost of the negative self-signal that hedging would produce outweighed the pecuniary rewards associated with hedging. Participants readily accepted hedges and pure gambles with no diagnostic costs. They also more readily accepted hedges with diagnostic costs when the pecuniary rewards associated with those hedges were greater.

Identifying transportation capacity (road and railways) is an important task that can identify whether the network is capable of sustaining the present volume of traffic and whether it can handle the future intended traffic flow. A new city, XiongAn, will be built in the coming years in order to relieve the pressure of population on Beijing and disperse the economic growth, business activity, and opportunities across the country. The focus of this research is to generate a transportation model between Beijing and XiongAn, in order to increase connection and connectivity, reduce travel time, and increase transfer capacity between the two hubs (Beijing-XiongAn). The existing transportation network between two cities is analyzed and a network which can handle future demand has been proposed. The first stage has been the investigation of a variety of options using geographic information system (GIS). Planning and implementing a mass transit system requires choosing among options such as an existing intercity railway line, a new high-speed railway line, and/or motorway options. In the second phase of our analysis, we assess these options relative to multiple criteria, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The options were evaluated using various criteria responsible for selection of alternative; it is found that travel time, cost of travel, safety, reliability, accessibility, and environment are key criteria for selecting the best alternative. The GIS and multicriteria analysis suggested that the best option is to build a new high speed railway line. © 2018 Asim Farooq et al.",,"Analytic hierarchy process; Economics; Geographic information systems; Information use; Light rail transit; Population statistics; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Traffic control; Travel time; Urban growth; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Mass transit systems; Multi Criteria Analysis; Transportation capacity; Transportation model; Transportation network; Transportation planning; Transportation requirements; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058979542

A specific contemporary challenge is to account for the prolonged slow growth and stagnant productivity that has followed the post-financial crisis recession, along with low inflation despite low unemployment (notably in the UK). We set out a simple three-equation model, which extends the core model in our two recent books (Carlin and Soskice, 2006, 2015) to one with two equilibria and two associated macroeconomic policy regimes. One is the standard inflation-targeting policy regime with equilibrium associated with central bank inflation targeting through monetary policy. It is joined by a second, Keynesian policy regime and equilibrium, with a zero lower bound (ZLB) in the nominal interest rate and a ZLB in inflation in which only fiscal policy is effective (Ragot, 2015). Our approach is related to the Benigno and Fornaro (2016) Keynesian- Wicksellian model of growth with business cycles. It diverges from New Keynesian models because although we attribute model-consistent expectations to the policy-maker, we do not assume that these are the basis for inflation and growth expectations of workers and firms. We compare our approach to Ravn and Sterk's related multiple equilibrium New Keynesian model (Ravn and Sterk, 2016). © The Author 2018.","Inflation-targeting; Liquidity trap; Multiple equilibria; Stagnation; Strategic complementarity; Zero lower bound","complementarity; economic policy; equilibrium; inflation; interest rate; Keynesian theory; macroeconomics; productivity; unemployment; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041462766

One of these phases is the evaluation of alternatives, in which the consumer compares the benefits that will be obtained from each product or service depending on a set of criteria. Recently, the rise of online ecosystems has fueled the development of new purchasing-decision prediction models (PDPM) based on the shared opinions, concerns, and expectations of customers. Commonly, these PDPMs are constructed as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, where experts ascertain the consumer's purchasing criteria, as well as the importance of them, by means of surveys and their own experience. Although relying on experts may be appropriate for identifying criteria, this approach is not suitable for assessing the importance of said criteria due to the large volume of information available on the Web. Furthermore, the preferences of consumers in online ecosystems evolve constantly. In this regard, we consider that the information about purchase-criteria importance should be derived exclusively from the opinions of consumers. However, the attitude and thought-process leading to purchases contain inherent relationships that consumers are not able to express explicitly; consequently, we explore the possibility to make use of the synergies between criteria along user preferences. This paper proposes a new PDPM that estimates the importance of the criteria and values the alternatives by only considering the opinions expressed by consumers in digital ecosystems, while using an expert-defined set of criteria. The proposed approach extracts the weights of both criteria and alternatives and determines the implicit synergies within them without the need of additional input. Lastly, it uses the Choquet integral for weight and valuation aggregation and determines a purchase ranking. This model has been tested in real examples, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2018","Aggregation operators; Choquet integral; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Synergy criteria","Decision theory; Ecosystems; Integral equations; Learning to rank; Marketing; Mathematical operators; Operations research; Predictive analytics; Purchasing; Sentiment analysis; Aggregation operator; Choquet integral; Digital ecosystem; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Prediction model; Purchase criteria; Purchasing decisions; Synergy criteria; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050870311

In the mode with manufacturer conducting service (Mode M), our analysis shows that if the service efficiency is high (low), the retailer should voluntarily (not) share its demand forecast. If the service efficiency is moderate, a side-payment contract or a bargaining mechanism can induce the retailer to share. In the mode with retailer conducting service (Mode R), no information sharing is the unique equilibrium. In both modes, supply chain members are generally better off when their forecasts become more accurate. Moreover, the positive impact of more accurate forecasts on both the manufacturer and the retailer is generally much stronger in Mode R than in Mode M.

Although researchers attempted to investigate the gaps in CSR communication from various perspectives, they tended to ignore how these communication patterns differ between various geographical regions from a collective perspective, i.e. they lacked the capacity to cover the entire population in an integrated geographical region, and thus could not identify the differences and directions for improvement accurately. Based on the agenda-building theory, this study analyzes international contractors’ CSR communication patterns with their stakeholders in three regions, i.e. the US, the EU, and China. Through this comparative analysis, this study identifies similarities and differences in the communication patterns between Chinese international contractors and those of developed countries in a collective manner. To perform these analyses, empirical data from international contractors’ CSR reports are firstly used to construct CSR semantic networks. The defining concepts of CSR in the US, the EU, and China are then identified, thereby allowing us to compare CSR communication patterns in China with those in developed countries. The results show that the stage of a country's CSR development is reflected by the areas on which its international contractors focus. For example, community involvement and development indicates that China is still in the initial stage of developing a CSR norm. Labor practices are important across all regions, but the reasons for their importance are different. These findings provide Chinese contractors with practical guidance for expanding their overseas markets and engaging in sound CSR practices while executing international projects. This study can also inform other international contractors about CSR communication patterns in China, thereby facilitating international cooperation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Communication patterns; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Developed countries; International contractors; Perceptions","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Geographical regions; International cooperation; Semantics; Sensory perception; China; Communication pattern; Community involvement; Comparative analysis; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Developed countries; International projects; Contractors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053203517

In this paper, we study the acquisition of supplemental irrigation water rights as an adaptation strategy undertaken by irrigation-dependent farmers in response to historical climate change. By exploiting the panel structure of a unique dataset of farm-level supplemental right adoption decisions in the state of Oregon, we establish a relationship between climate conditions, competition for local water resources, and the acquisition of supplemental rights. Our results indicate that a warmer, drier climate increases the likelihood that irrigated farms acquire supplemental rights, suggesting that farmers in Oregon have used supplemental rights to adapt to historical climate change. We also find evidence of heterogeneous effects suggesting that junior irrigators, groundwater-dependent irrigators, and farmers with access to a relatively lower volume of water have been most affected by historical climate change with respect to their supplemental water right acquisition decisions. © 2018","Adaptation; Climate change; Irrigation; Water rights","adaptive management; agricultural economics; climate change; decision making; future prospect; irrigation system; legislation; panel data; strategic approach; water resource; water storage; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051410643

However, nitrogen excretion from pasture-based dairy farming is also a large source of nitrogen leaching and emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Ryegrass bred to express elevated concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates (‘high-sugar’ grass; HSG) has been shown to decrease dietary nitrogen excretion in urine of cattle, and may increase milk yields per cow, but it is unclear how this translates to environmental footprints at the farm- and product-levels. This study evaluates, for the first time, the environmental footprint of HSG dairy systems with life cycle analysis, measured as land occupation in addition to global warming, eutrophication, acidification and resource depletion potentials (energy-based and economic allocation methods). Data from meta-analysis and simulation were combined to model a pasture-based dairy farm under a conventional perennial ryegrass-based scenario (Sc-CTR) and an HSG-based scenario (Sc-HSG). In addition, grass type interactions with six manure management permutations were considered, leading to 12 scenarios in total. It was found that eutrophication and acidification potentials per unit of energy-corrected milk could be reduced by 4–6% and 7–11% respectively when switching from Sc-CTR to Sc-HSG, and that these reductions could reach 22% and 40% respectively with more efficient manure management. It is concluded that a simple change in choice of grazing sward may deliver substantial environmental gains, especially when combined with improved farm technology. However, the high costs for improving manure management could drive expansion of HSG pastures as a more attractive short-term measure for farmers, while regulation and access to capital could drive investment in improved manure storage infrastructure and spreading equipment. © 2018 The Authors","Dairy farm scenario modelling; Dairy production; High-sugar grass; Life cycle analysis; Manure management; N excretion","Acidification; Dairies; Digital storage; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Eutrophication; Farms; Fertilizers; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Manures; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; High-sugar grass; Life cycle analysis; Manure management; N excretions; Scenario modelling; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053201030

The effects of visual attribute and alternative non-attendance (NA) on respondent choices are analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Two laboratory experiments that combined eye tracking and DCEs were conducted with 109 and 117 participants in the USA. The DCEs varied in task complexity by the number of product attributes and alternatives. Findings: Results suggest that participants ignore both single attributes and entire alternatives. Increasing the number of alternatives significantly increased attribute NA. Including NA in choice modeling influenced results more in more complex DCEs. Research limitations/implications: The current experiments did not test for choice overload. Future studies could investigate more complex designs. The choice environment affects decision-making. Future research could compare laboratory and field experiments. Practical implications: Private and public sectors often use DCEs to determine consumer preference. Results suggest that DCEs with two alternatives are superior to DCEs with four alternatives because NA was lower in the two-alternative design. Originality/value: This empirical research examined effects of attribute and alternative NA on choice modeling using eye tracking and DCEs with varying degrees of task complexity. Results suggest that accounting for NA reduces the risk of over- or understating the impact of attributes on choice, in that one avoids claiming significance for attributes that might not truly be preferred, and vice versa. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Marketing research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054533941

Findings revealed that energy flows and energy efficiency alone are not sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of hotels’ energy profiles. Thus, it is suggested that corresponding exergy flows and efficiency rates should also be estimated along with the energy ones. This study infers that location and hotel star rating classification do not seem to be key parameters in assessing lodgings’ energy quality profiles, which suggests the need for further research. The practical implications for hotel managers are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Efficiency; Energy; Environmental management; Exergy; Hospitality industry; Hotels","Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental management; Exergy; Hotels; Comprehensive assessment; Decision making process; Empirical studies; Energy; Environmental profile; Gross domestic products; Hospitality industry; International tourisms; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053073990

Although the literature suggests that firms are heterogeneous in their price responses, little empirical research has examined how competitors actually respond. This study investigates how hotels strategically respond to competitors’ room rate decisions through the lens of the firm dyad. Through an empirical analysis using a fixed effect spatial panel, we find 1) that smaller hotels reduce their room rates following price cuts of larger hotels, while the larger hotels are unaffected by discounts of smaller hotels, 2) that chain and independent hotels are interdependent in their price decisions, and 3) that older hotels discount room rates when their newer competitors cut prices while price cuts by older hotels are not associated with price-cutting by newer properties.

The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households’ income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agrarian settlement; Brazil; Deforestation; Dynamic panel; Welfare","Climate change; Conservation; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Deforestation; Economics; Ecosystems; Agrarian settlement; Agricultural expansion; Brazil; Dynamic panels; Environmental costs; Forest conservation; Generating capacity; Welfare; Economic and social effects; agrarian reform; agricultural intensification; climate change; cost analysis; deforestation; economic analysis; ecosystem service; government; household income; long-term change; panel data; policy making; resource allocation; settlement planning; tropical forest; welfare reform; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020734703

We study this question in the context of cloud infrastructure services. The provider offers two levels of support, basic and full. Under basic support, the provider handles simple service quality issues. Under full support, the provider also offers education, training, and personalized guidance through two-way interactions with buyers. Using unique data on public cloud infrastructure services use by 22,179 firms from March 2009 to August 2012, we find that buyers who receive full support use the service 34.85 percent more than other users. We further show that buyers who have full support deploy infrastructure services more efficiently, increasing the fraction of servers they run in parallel by 3.53 percentage points relative to those who do not. Furthermore, buyers who drop full support and switch back to basic support continue using 15.01 percent more of the service and have a proportion of servers running in parallel that is 2.82 percentage points higher compared to buyers who have never received full support. These findings provide suggestive evidence of buyer learning as a result of provider support. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN  47405, United States","Most models of technology adoption and use assume a rational decision maker engaged in thoughtful deliberate consideration of the new technology. However, recent research in psychology concludes that such deliberate, rational, conscious decision-making (termed System 2 cognition) has less influence on behavior than originally thought; nonconscious automatic cognition (termed System 1 cognition), which is often influenced by personality characteristics and pattern matching based on past experience, also plays a key role in most decisions. As users adopt and use new technologies time and time again, a set of general expectations about new technology adoption begins to emerge. A user's personality combined with this pattern of positive and negative experiences creates System 1 heuristics that are triggered when a user faces a similar decision in the future. The focus of this paper is to examine the extent to which the predispositions produced by System 1 automatic cognition – both enabling and inhibiting – versus the deliberate technology assessment produced by System 2 cognition influence technology adoption and use. We found that enabling predispositions influences the formation of intentions to use a new technology, and both enabling and inhibiting predispositions influence an individual's ultimate follow through in acting on his or her intentions and actually using new technologies. Our research suggests that concepts previously seen as “determinants” of technology adoption and use (e.g., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions) are not really determinants but rather are important partial mediators in a larger nomological network that includes both automatic System 1 cognition and deliberate System 2 cognition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic cognition; Deliberate cognition; Duality; Enabling beliefs; Inhibiting beliefs; Predisposition; System 1 cognition; System 2 cognition; Technology adoption; Technology readiness contributor; Technology readiness inhibitor; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology","Behavioral research; Decision making; Pattern matching; Automatic cognition; Deliberate cognition; Duality; Enabling beliefs; Inhibiting beliefs; Predisposition; System 1 cognition; System 2 cognition; Technology adoption; Technology readiness; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046106514

With regard to oral healthcare, more integrated services for older adults are needed to effectively serve their complex medical and dental needs. Using an agent-based simulation model, this paper examines the influence of social ties and transportation mode choices on opportunities for older adults to participate in community-based preventive screening events and access needed oral healthcare. This approach accounts for the heterogeneity of behavior that arises for a population exhibiting diversity in terms of social factors, including socioeconomic means and social support. In the context of older adults living in urban environments, the availability of different transportation modes ought to be taken into consideration. To explore alternative scenarios for the accessibility of preventive screening events offered at senior centers in northern Manhattan, an agent-based model (ABM) was created with a geographic information system (GIS) to simulate the influence of social ties and transportation choices on older adults seeking preventive screening services and oral healthcare. Results of simulation experiments indicate preferences for public transportation and inequities in accessibility that may be mitigated with social support. This simulation model offers a way to explore social support as an important factor in making transportation mode choices that mediate oral healthcare accessibility and thus oral health outcomes for older adults. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling; Geographic information science; Healthcare accessibility; Multi-modal transportation analysis; Social influence","accessibility; adult; elderly population; GIS; health care; numerical model; oral health; social impact; transportation mode",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047056197

The purpose of this study is to understand the risks that present most concern to family carers; explore attitudes and approaches of this group towards risk; and examine how information about risks is shared between familial carers, care recipients and professionals working in dementia care. Five focus groups were held across Northern Ireland between April and July 2015 involving 22 carers. Risks of most concern were driving, falls, financial risks, getting lost and using electrical appliances. Concepts of ‘risk’ related to terms such as danger, harm and vulnerability with emphasis on consequences rather than likelihoods. The psychosocial benefits of taking risk were recognised by some participants. Discussion of risks with family members with dementia primarily involved bringing risk matters to the attention of the individual. Family carers talked with a wide range of professionals about risks. Divergences in perspectives were noted, particularly in relation to matters of health and safety. A model of risk communication is developed illustrating how this can play a key role in informed, shared decision-making where a family member has dementia, serving an important role in risk management processes in informal community dementia care. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dementia; family carers; informed decision-making; risk; risk communication; risk management","Behavioral research; Neurodegenerative diseases; Risk management; Risks; dementia; Electrical appliances; family carers; Health and social care; Informed decision; Risk communication; Risk management process; Shared decision makings; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989245080

The main objective of this paper is to support the retailer to make optimal day-ahead dynamic pricing decisions in such a mixed customer pool. To this end, we propose a two-level decision-making framework where the retailer acting as upper-level agent firstly announces its electricity prices of next 24 h and customers acting as lower-level agents subsequently schedule their energy usages accordingly. For the lower level problem, we model the price responsiveness of different customers according to their unique characteristics.

Self-report measures of drug risk reading show mixed results. This exploratory study investigates this topic within the context of a branded prescription drug website for a fictional seasonal allergy drug. We use a mixed-methods approach involving eye-tracking, survey and qualitative data. While approximately 80% of participants (N = 29) claimed to have read half or more of the risk information, eye-tracking measures revealed limited to no risk reading when given the opportunity to freely view the site without explicit directions to read risk information. Survey results showed minimal unaided recall and modest aided recall of risks. To gain insight into why participants failed to seek drug risk information, we analyzed retro-active think aloud post-task interviews for potential explanations and looked for expressions of social desirability, information avoidance, optimism bias and familiarity. Perceived familiarity with the health condition, its risks and companion drug options surfaced as the primary explanation for failure to seek, and subsequently process, the risk information. This perceived familiarity prompted participants to ignore the risk information and discount the commercial information source. We offer practical recommendations to encourage risk reading in light of our findings. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","drug websites; eye-tracking; health risk information and processing; prescription drug risks","Health risks; Surveys; Websites; Commercial information; Exploratory studies; Eye-tracking; Practical recommendation; Prescription drugs; Qualitative data; Risk information; Social desirability; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983802060

In this data, consumer search behavior is observed prior to a transaction. I use data on consumers shopping for books online to link prices and consumer search patterns at different bookstores, estimating consumer search costs in the context of a fixed-sample search model. The search patterns indicate that consumers visit relatively few firms and exhibit a strong search preference for prominent retailers. I control for search intensities at different retailers during consumers’ search process and find that search cost estimates are lower than when assuming consumers sample equally among alternatives. Accounting for heterogeneity in consumer search intensities across retailers reduces search cost estimates from $2.30 to $1.24 per search. I examine search cost heterogeneity by using a rich set of consumer characteristics and relating them to search patterns and search costs estimates. I use a flexible random effects model in which the number and order of firms visited by the consumer are her optimal ordered choices, allowing search cost cutoffs to depend on regressors. The estimates indicate that consumer search costs are related to their observable characteristics, such as income, where individuals with income greater than $100,000 incur relatively higher search costs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer search; E-commerce; Fixed sample search; Online book industry; Search frictions","Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Electronic commerce; Friction; Random processes; Sales; Book industry; Consumer search; Fixed sample search; Purchasing behaviors; Random effects model; Search intensity; Search patterns; Search preference; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046688537

They are increasingly being developed and implemented worldwide. Although the importance of evaluating the success of integrated ocean management initiatives is widely recognized, so is its complexity, and there is still limited knowledge or empirical experience on how to actually carry out such an evaluation. This research aims to develop a framework to evaluate the performance of marine spatial planning (MSP) (focusing on the tangible outcomes of such initiatives). Portugal's maritime area totals c. 3,800,000 km2. As one of the world's largest maritime nations, and with its ocean governance framework finalised in 2015, Portugal emerges as a relevant case study for the development of a mechanism to evaluate performance of its MSP system. A step-by-step participatory approach was designed to develop a set of indicators that could constitute the core of an evaluation mechanism of the performance of the Portuguese MSP system. The resulting fifteen indicators cover all aspects of an IPOO framework (inputs, process, outputs, outcomes) relevant in an MSP context (data and information base, transparency, aspects related to conflict, and to economic activities such as levels of investment and jobs), while including contextual indicators related to the state of the marine environment. These indicators thus simultaneously allow an assessment of the economic, social, and environmental effects of MSP, including some integrative high-level indicators such as well-being. This research demonstrates the interest and usefulness of using a participatory approach to the development of a comprehensive performance evaluation mechanism of Portuguese MSP. It exemplifies a shift towards a new, participatory, approach to the monitoring and evaluation stages of the MSP cycle, which may constitute a useful tool in the emerging field of MSP evaluation in Europe and beyond. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Indicators; Monitoring; MSP performance evaluation; Portugal; Stakeholder engagement","Indicators (instruments); Industrial engineering; Monitoring; Production engineering; Comprehensive performance evaluation; Integrated ocean managements; Marine Spatial Planning; Monitoring and evaluations; MSP performance evaluation; Participatory approach; Portugal; Stakeholder engagement; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041279494

These problems are particularly important for low-priority patients who often remain in the queue for extended periods. We investigate two distinct approaches to address these challenges: fast track (FT) and dynamic priority queue (DPQ). Traditionally, EDs have prioritized patients using an Emergency Severity Index (ESI), in conjunction with FT, to strictly or partially dedicate resources to different ESI patient classes. With our proposed DPQ, patients are prioritized using ESI and additional real-time operational information about the patient, specifically the amount of accumulated wait time and flow time. Using an empirical simulation, we compare the impact of different resource allocation and prioritization approaches on patient length of stay (LOS), including the existing system at the ED, FT with strict and partial dedication and the possibility of shorter and less variable service times, and versions of the proposed DPQ using simple dynamic prioritization. Our main results are that: (i) the DPQ approach dominates the other approaches tested; (ii) for various ED sizes, FT with strict and partial dedication do not reduce average LOS of low-priority patients without significantly increasing average LOS of high-priority patients, unless service time mean and variance are reduced; (iii) DPQ using accumulated wait time or accumulated flow time improves performance. The results are robust to changes in the proportion of patients in each priority level. Overall, expanding decision making about patient prioritization from only considering the patient's clinical condition to also including operational data can improve performance dramatically, even without improved service times. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Customer prioritization; Focused and flexible resources; Service system design","Decision making; Queueing theory; Clinical conditions; Dynamic priority queue; Emergency departments; Empirical simulations; Flexible resources; Improve performance; Prioritization; Service system designs; Emergency rooms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047098185

We start with a distributionally robust Nash equilibrium model where each player uses partial information to construct a set of distributions and chooses an optimal decision on the basis of the worst distribution rather than the worst scenario to hedge the risk arising from ambiguity of the true probability distribution. We investigate the existence of equilibrium, develop a numerical scheme for its computation, and consider special cases where the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium model can be reformulated as an ordinary deterministic Nash equilibrium. We then extend our modeling scheme to two possible frameworks of distributionally robust Stackelberg setting: a distributionally robust follower model and a distributionally robust leader model. These two frameworks are employed to study an innovative problem of hierarchical competition in a supply chain where a buyer not only invests in its own capacity to supply an end-product market under demand uncertainty but also outsources a certain amount of market supplies to multiply competing suppliers who invest in capacity for obtaining the buyer's orders. In this application, we show that the buyer has more incentives to invest in capacity whereas the suppliers have less to do so when those suppliers are confronted with more demand uncertainty in the end-product market over the buyer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Distributionally robust Nash equilibrium; Distributionally robust Stackelberg models; Game theory; Hierarchical capacity investment; Risk-averse equilibrium models","Commerce; Competition; Computation theory; Decision theory; Investments; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Sales; Supply chains; Capacity investment; Competing suppliers; Complete information; Equilibrium models; Nash equilibria; Partial information; Robust game theories; Stackelberg model; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026755042

Local governments struggle to provide adequate public services under budgetary constraints and vast spatial and economic inequalities. After the demise of the centralized modernist planning paradigm, current approaches to urban development focus on public-private partnerships, resulting in networks of dependency that involve multiple stakeholders and complex relationships of accountability. This stakeholder complexity complicates decision making, but can also lead to new social practices and participatory models of infrastructure governance. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of social practices surrounding the provision and modernization of streetlight and electricity in Paco, Manila, enacted by formal and informal actors. Drawing from the case study, literature on organizational improvisation and improvisational governance (Martijn Hartog, 2015), we propose a model of infrastructure governance that is based on the concept of improvisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with city officials, planners, residents and local activists, we develop the notion of improstructure as a conceptual model for understanding infrastructure governance as an improvisational process of “call and response” among a diverse set of actors. We apply this perspective to ongoing modernization efforts by the city of Manila and its utility companies, involving smart city technologies including sensor networks, drone mapping, and data analytics. We argue that despite the placeless and generic rhetoric surrounding these technologies, they constitute improvisational responses to local conditions. We conclude by formulating design principles for improvisational infrastructure governance, which are not limited to the Global South, but also apply in developed countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"centralization; decision making; developing world; governance approach; infrastructure planning; modernization; public service; stakeholder; urban development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032992813

We develop a nuanced understanding of how justice dimensions reduce task and relationship conflict in buyer-supplier relationships. In addition, we hypothesize that task conflict mediates the relationship between justice dimensions and relationship conflict. We also hypothesize that the effect of justice dimensions on conflict is contingent on the buyer-supplier cultural distance and the degree of autonomy provided to the supplier. Based on primary data on buyer-supplier relationships, our results show that procedural and interactional justice dimensions are more important than distributive fairness. Furthermore, managers can reduce the relationship conflict by mitigating task conflict, which has not been asserted in the buyer-supplier relationship literature. Our results suggest that supplier autonomy and cultural distance, as contextual variables, influence the relationship between interactional justice and conflict dimensions, but they do not influence the relationship between procedural or distributive justice and conflict dimensions. We discuss the relative importance and role of the three justice dimensions in mitigating relational conflicts in buyer-supplier relationships, and implications of our results to theory as well as practice. © 2017 IEEE.","Cultural distance; distributive justice; interactional justice; procedural justice; relationship conflict; supplier autonomy; task conflict","Decision making; Friction; Instruments; Societies and institutions; Stresses; Cultural difference; Cultural distance; distributive justice; interactional justice; Procedural justice; Relationship conflicts; supplier autonomy; Task conflicts; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032437275

To answer this question, we study two important trade-offs. First, working with a team provides access to additional resources but also leads to increased coordination costs. Second, sharing the risks and costs of developing an idea necessitates sharing the potential rewards of a successful idea. We use unique data on idea generators and their submission of ideas to an innovation program in a large European company between 1996 and 2008 to show how the two different trade-offs affect the decision of idea generators to collaborate with a team. Managerial summary: Organizations usually form teams to develop and execute innovative ideas. When people have the choice, however, will they also form a team or will they develop ideas alone? By studying idea generators and their voluntary submissions of breakthrough ideas to an innovation program, we find that the success rate is much higher for team ideas. Although teamwork has important benefits, idea generators will often develop incremental ideas alone and only accept increased coordination costs for developing radical ideas—this is even more so when they have prior team experiences. Moreover, only when idea generators were successful before and—even more so—when they developed that idea alone, will they be more open to sharing the rewards and risks of developing another idea with a team. © 2017 The Authors.

In this study we investigated the impact of selected characteristics of financial threats on individuals’ decisions to avoid risk information in an incentivised online experiment. We found that threat severity, relative risk, and effectiveness of threat prevention alone do not influence decisions to avoid risk information. However, we did find an interaction effect between the first two treatments. Furthermore, our data suggest that coping style, locus of control, and anticipated emotional response are statistically significant predictors of financial risk information avoidance. © 2018 The Author(s).

How companies design a contract to motivate supplier participation is an important but under-examined empirical question. Analytical studies have started to examine the optimal contract that aligns buyer-supplier incentives in joint NPD projects, but empirical evidence is scarce about the actual contracts offered by buying companies. Bridging the analytical and empirical literature, this paper compares optimal contracting derived from a parsimonious analytical model with actual behaviors observed in an experiment. In particular, we focus on how project uncertainty, buying company effort share, and buyer risk aversion influence three contractual decisions: total investment level, revenue share and fixed fee. Our results indicate significant differences between the optimal and actual behaviors. We identify various types of non-optimal contractual behaviors, which we explain from a risk aversion as well as a bounded rationality perspective. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature by showing that (1) the actual contractual behaviors could differ significantly from the optimal ones, (2) the actual contract design is sensitive to changes in project uncertainty and buying company effort share, and (3) the significant roles of risk aversion and bounded rationality in explaining the non-optimal contractual behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral experiment; Contract design; New product development (NPD); Risk aversion; Supplier involvement","Economics; Investments; Product design; Sales; Behavioral experiment; Contract design; New product development; Risk aversion; Supplier involvement; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042113175

Rents could induce firms to lobby or bribe governments to preserve the status quo; on the other hand, rents may promote growth by giving firms the needed funds to make investments in fixed capital or research and development. To test this question empirically, we use a panel of manufacturing data at the industry-country-year level, and measure rents by the mark-up ratio. We find that the relationship between rents and growth is strongly negative, with the results being primarily driven by the poorer countries (or those with worse institutions) in the sample. This result holds when we instrument for mark-up using the average mark-up in other industries in the country. Even in industries with high external financing needs and countries with less developed financial sectors, precisely the places where excess profits could be used to drive growth, we find that rents are especially harmful. Consistent with the rent-seeking mechanism we highlight, we find that high rents are associated with a slower reduction in tariffs. We also test for the most likely alternative mechanism, that higher rents cause slower growth through the channel of allowing managerial slack. We find that controlling for management has little impact on our estimate of the impact of mark-up on productivity growth.. © 2018 The Authors","Competition; Developing countries; Firm performance; Global; Manufacturing; Rents","competition (economics); developing world; economic development; economic growth; economic impact; global economy; industrial performance; manufacturing; productivity; rent seeking; tariff structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051408245

It has raised the consciousness for the need for a unified decision-support model for Facilities Managers and Owners, which could be used for office buildings across countries in achieving cleaner building energy production and use. This paper aimed at examining the factors that affect office Building Energy Performance; their interdependencies; and identify the critical path for interventions. It filled this gap by presenting a combination of interrelated processes (operations, tactics, and strategies) needed to improve building energy performance, reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions in buildings for organizations. An online questionnaire survey was used in gathering data on current study model variables from participants of case study office buildings in Nigeria and the UK. Structural Equation Modelling technique was used to examine the factors that contribute to improving the energy performance of heterogeneous office buildings in both countries. The result established a strong correlation among observed variables and constructs and high covariance between constructs. This indicates that dependency and interdependence relationships exist amongst constructs, and in between construct and indicators. The finding reveals that an organization needs Sustainability Policy, Facilities Management and Energy Management as a sub-set of Strategic policy incorporated into its core management policy and operations energy management to achieve low carbon building. It also reveals the most critical pathway in the overall model with Strategic Facilities Management discovered to underpin the optimal performance for office buildings. © 2018","Building performance; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas emissions; Management policy; Strategic sustainability; Structural equation modelling","Carbon; Climate change; Decision support systems; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Surveys; Sustainable development; Building energy performance; Building performance; Decision support models; Facilities management; Global climate changes; Management policy; Structural equation modelling; Sustainability policy; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053076027

We show that intermediaries can reduce new firm growth rates due to institutional conflict. To analyze this idea, we examine the setting of junior stock exchanges, which are commonly formed to facilitate entrepreneurial growth. The introduction of these exchanges focused investment into new technology firms, reduced investment in other sectors, and led to diminishing new firm growth. Our findings demonstrate how institutional conflict causes unintended effects and reveals the complexity of influencing entrepreneurship with institutional intermediaries. Managerial Summary: Investors and entrepreneurs face uncertainty when deciding what firms to start and fund. We show that an intermediation effort to make entry easier for entrepreneurs increases the uncertainty that entrepreneurs and investors face. For investors, the enthusiasm for technology firms engendered by the new exchange can motivate investment in marginal firms to maintain as desired deal flow. However, lower firm growth and less liquidity in the future is likely. For entrepreneurs, our results indicate that it is more challenging to manage technology firm growth as well as there is potential opportunity to investigate other industries. Finally, for policy-makers and supporters of the new exchanges, our results imply that investment flows are altered as intended, but unless listing standards remain high, the virtuous cycle of investment upon which a healthy entrepreneurial climate rests may be disrupted, muting the intended effects of the new exchange. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","entrepreneurship; institutional change; institutional conflict; institutional theory; intermediaries","Financial markets; entrepreneurship; Institutional change; institutional conflict; Institutional theory; intermediaries; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052841068

Consequently, SWM has developed into a highly complex systemic planning problem and analytical tools are needed to assist in the development of more sustainable SWM strategies. Here, we present the Solid Waste Infrastructure Modelling System (SWIMS) software, which is the first non-linear dynamic, LCA-based optimisation tool for SWM that optimises for both economic and environmental performance. The environmental and economic costs of treating generated wastes at available treatment facilities are calculated through a series of life cycle process models, based on non-linear expressions defined for each waste material and each treatment process type. Possible treatment paths for waste streams are identified using a depth first search algorithm and a sequential evolutionary genetic algorithm is used to prioritise the order of these paths, in lieu of user defined optimisation criteria and constraints. SWIMS calculates waste arisings into the future and determines if it is possible to treat generated waste, while considering present and future constraints (e.g. capacity). If additional capacity is required, SWIMS will identify the optimum infrastructure solution to meet this capacity demand. A demonstrative case study of MSW management in GB from 2010 to 2050 is presented. Results suggest that sufficient capacity is available in existing and planned infrastructure to cope with future demand for SWM and meet national regulatory and legislative requirements with relatively little capital investment beyond 2020. SWIMS can be used to provide valuable information for SWM decision makers, particularly when used to analyse the effects of possible future national or regional policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Infrastructure planning; Life cycle assessment; Non-linear programming; Optimisation; Sustainability; Waste management","Cost effectiveness; Decision support systems; Environmental management; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Life cycle; Nonlinear programming; Solid wastes; Storm sewers; Sustainable development; Waste management; Waste treatment; Decision support tools; Depth first search algorithms; Economic and environmental performance; Infrastructure planning; Legislative requirements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Non-linear dynamics; Optimisations; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048386991

Estimation results were obtained from a conditional logit, conditional logit with interaction terms, random parameter logit, random parameter logit with correlation, and individual-level coefficient models. A novelty of our analysis was the consideration of monetary and non-monetary incentives as factors influencing consumer uptake in green pricing programs. The estimation results show that increased consumer participation in green pricing programs is positively linked with green energy sources that produce fewer externalities, more jobs, and monetary incentives such as tax credits or green mileage. However, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between participation rates and the share of green electricity in total electricity supply. Mean willingness to pay for fuel cells is highest, followed by solar and wind energy. Estimation from the random parameter logit with allowing for correlations among random coefficients of attributes reveals that consumers are divided into ‘green (pro-environment) consumers’ and ‘blue (growth-oriented) consumers’. Green consumers prefer a higher green electricity share, solar or fuel cell to wind, a greater proximity of green power plants to their homes, and green mileage or green parks to tax credits. In comparison, ‘blue consumers’ favor a lower green electricity share, green power plants that are far from their homes, and monetary incentives rather than non-monetary incentives. The results of this study suggest guidelines for the design of successful green pricing programs. Green pricing programs that are designed with information on types of green energy sources, consider the distance of power plants to consumers’ residences, focus on the share of green electricity, and incorporate monetary incentives are likely to have increased consumer participation rates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Choice experiment; Green energy; Green pricing program; Monetary incentives","Costs; Energy policy; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel cells; Parameter estimation; Taxation; Wind power; Choice experiments; Consumer participation; Green energy; Green energy sources; Green pricing programs; Monetary incentives; Random coefficients; Solar and wind energies; Economics; alternative energy; electricity supply; incentive; pricing policy; solar power; willingness to pay; wind power; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049959406

The principal contribution of this paper is therefore to analyse energy demand for European industries over the period 1995–2009 using a dynamic multilevel model that accounts for this hierarchical data structure. Among other things, we find, firstly, that our dynamic multilevel model suggests that if industry income and the industry energy price increase by 10%, long run energy demand will increase by 8.1% and fall by 6.8%, respectively. Secondly, we find that the corresponding long run income and price elasticities are substantially larger in a standard dynamic model of industry level energy demand which does not account for the hierarchical data structure. Our results therefore suggest that not accounting for the hierarchical data structure results in unreliable estimates of energy demand elasticities. From a policy perspective we argue that it is imperative that future industry level energy demand studies account for the hierarchical structure of the data. This is to prevent energy policy making being based on industry level evidence that substantially inflates the responsiveness of long run energy demand to income and price changes. © 2018","European countries; Industrial energy demand; Long-run elasticities; Multilevel modelling","Costs; Data structures; Elasticity; Regression analysis; Energy demands; European Countries; European industry; Hierarchical data structure; Hierarchical structures; Industrial energy; Multilevel model; Price elasticity; Energy management; demand analysis; demand elasticity; energy market; energy policy; hierarchical system; income; numerical model; price dynamics; regression analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048419772

When the firm has information about the state of the system, yet lacks information on customer types, delay announcements play a dual role: they inform customers about the state of the system, while they also have the potential to elicit information on customer types based on their response to the announcements. The tension between these two goals has implications for the type of information that can be shared credibly. To explore the value of the information on customer types, we also study a model where the firm can observe customer types.

Our focus is on models that include spatial lags of the dependent variable, e.g., the SAR specification. A major point is that practitioners rely on scalar summary measures of direct and indirect effects estimates to interpret the impact of changes in explanatory variables on the dependent variable of interest. We argue that these should be the focus of Monte Carlo experiments. Since effects estimates reflect a nonlinear function of both β and ρ, past studies’ focus exclusively on β and ρ parameter estimates may not provide useful information regarding statistical properties of effects estimates produced by alternative estimators. Since effects estimates have recently become the focus of inference regarding the significance of (scalar summary) direct and indirect impacts arising from changes in the explanatory variables, empirical measures of dispersion produced by simulating draws from the (estimated) variance–covariance matrix of the parameters β and ρ should be part of the Monte Carlo study. An implication is that differences in the quality of estimated variance–covariance matrices arising from alternative estimators also plays a role in determining the accuracy of inference. An applied illustration is used to demonstrate how these issues can impact conclusions regarding the performance of alternative estimators. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Estimated variance–covariance matrices; Simulation of scalar summary direct and indirect effects; Spatial autoregressive models","econometrics; estimation method; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028762433

As the search for a “magic bullet” is replaced by an appreciation for the interplay between evidence, interests, culture, and outcomes, progress in relation to these dimensions requires assessment of achievements to date and identification of areas where knowledge and practice require attention most urgently. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: An international survey was administered to experts in the area of priority setting. The survey consisted of open-ended questions focusing on notable achievements, policy and practice challenges, and areas for future research in the discipline of priority setting. It was administered online between February and March of 2015. Findings: “Decision-making frameworks” and “Engagement” were the two most frequently mentioned notable achievements. “Priority setting in practice” and “Awareness and education” were the two most frequently mentioned policy and practical challenges. “Priority setting in practice” and “Engagement” were the two most frequently mentioned areas in need of future research. Research limitations/implications: Sampling bias toward more developed countries. Future study could use findings to create a more concise version to distribute more broadly. Practical implications: Globally, these findings could be used as a platform for discussion and decision making related to policy, practice, and research in this area. Originality/value: Whilst this study reaffirmed the continued importance of many longstanding themes in the priority setting literature, it is possible to also discern clear shifts in emphasis as the discipline progresses in response to new challenges. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Health and medicine; Health authorities; Hospital management; Resource management; Strategic management","achievement; article; awareness; bullet; decision making; developed country; education; hospital management; human; human experiment; medicine; outcome assessment; resource management; sampling bias; cross-sectional study; decision making; health care planning; health care policy; hospital management; questionnaire; trends; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Health Policy; Health Priorities; Hospital Administration; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045619498

We develop a non-constraining, easily implementable behavioral debias technique to help mitigate this tendency in demand forecasting and inventory decision-making settings. The debiasing technique has individuals record estimates of demand outcomes (REDO): participants explicitly record a self-generated estimate of every demand realization, allowing them to record a different value than the number of sales in periods with stockouts. In doing so, they construct a more representative sample of demand realizations (that differs from the sales sample). In three laboratory experiments with MBA and undergraduate students, this remedy significantly reduces downward bias in demand beliefs under censorship and leads to higher inventory order decisions. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society","behavioral operations; censored demand; debias; forecasting; newsvendor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038227707

Forecasts may be either unaided or made with the help of statistical forecasts. In practice, the latter are often crude forecasts that do not take sporadic perturbations into account. Most research considers forecasts based on series that have been cleansed of perturbation effects. This paper considers an experiment in which people made forecasts from time series that were disturbed by promotions. In all conditions, under-forecasting occurred during promotional periods and over-forecasting during normal ones. The relative sizes of these effects depended on the proportions of periods in the data series that contained promotions. The statistical forecasts improved the forecasting accuracy, not because they reduced these biases, but because they decreased the random error (scatter). The performance improvement did not depend on whether the forecasts were based on cleansed series. Thus, the effort invested in producing cleansed time series from which to forecast may not be warranted: companies may benefit from giving their forecasters even crude statistical forecasts. In a second experiment, forecasters received optimal statistical forecasts that took the effects of promotions into account fully. This increased the accuracy because the biases were almost eliminated and the random error was reduced by 20%. Thus, the additional effort required to produce forecasts that take promotional effects into account is worthwhile. © 2017 International Institute of Forecasters","Forecasting support; Judgmental adjustment; Promotions; Sales; Time series",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037707803

In this choice model, there are multiple customer types, and a customer of a particular type is interested in purchasing only a particular subset of products. We use the term consideration set to refer to the subset of products that a customer of a particular type is interested in purchasing. The consideration sets of customers of different types are nested in the sense that the consideration set of one customer type is included in the consideration set of another. The choice process for customers of different types is governed by the same multinomial logit model except for the fact that customers of different types have different consideration sets. Each product, if offered to customers, occupies a certain amount of space. The sale of each product generates a certain amount of revenue. Given that customers choose from among the offered products according to the multinomial logit model with nested consideration sets, the goal of the assortment problem is to find a set of products to offer to maximize the expected revenue obtained from a customer, while making sure that the total space consumption of the offered products does not exceed a certain limit. We show that this assortment problem is NP-hard, even when there is no limit on the total space consumption of the offered products.

Overall, we find limited evidence of differences in attribute parameter estimates, scale factors, and attribute increment values across elicitation treatments. However, we find significant differences in status-quo effects across elicitation treatments, with repeated-choice resulting in greater proportions of “action” votes, and consequently, higher program-level welfare estimates. Also, we find that single-choice yields drastically less-precise welfare estimates. Finally, we find some differences in attribute non-attendance behavior across elicitation formats, although there appears to be little consistency in class shares even within a given elicitation treatment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Best-worst scaling; Choice experiment; Contingent valuation; Ecosystem-service valuation; Stated preference; Survey; Willingness to pay","Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Resource valuation; Surveying; Best-worst scaling; Choice experiments; Contingent valuations; Ecosystem services; Stated preferences; Willingness to pay; Parameter estimation; contingent valuation; data acquisition; decision analysis; discrete choice analysis; ecosystem service; environmental economics; parameter estimation; valuation; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994742162

Given the complexity of construction projects, such impacts could be linear, nonlinear, sudden, delayed, direct, or rippled. Despite that realization, the construction literature falls short in studying how OOS is interrelated to the different project complex processes; thus, it is not possible to quantify the impacts of OOS on construction projects. The goal of this research is to develop and test an advanced model for analyzing the dynamics of OOS work. To this end, the authors used a multistep interdependent research methodology that involved (1) forming a dynamic hypothesis that explains the dynamics of the feedback structure of the problem in hand; (2) developing an advanced simulation model that captures the quantitative aspects of OOS and its corresponding relationship with progress, productivity, rework, and staffing, respectively; (3) developing a multistage calibration heuristic that enables users to calibrate the model to their projects to perform tailored and accurate analysis; (4) running verification tests on the model to ensure structural and behavioral validity; and (5) validating the model and its industry application using data from a mega construction project of around $500 million. Among other findings, the model demonstrated that not only the total magnitude of OOS work, but also the timing of such OOS work, has impacts on the project performance. The research has substantial intellectual merits to the construction management body of knowledge as it acts as the first to analyze the dynamic of OOS and capture its complexity. The research also introduces concepts and heuristics that add to the dynamic modeling field. As such, this study helps to better understand the relationship between OOS work and the different project feedback systems, visualize the rippled impacts of disruptions caused by OOS work, and provide informative forensic analysis of the corresponding project overruns. As for its practical merits, the presented model will assist project participants in properly analyzing and forecasting the direct and indirect effects of OOS in their projects and gauge the effectiveness of their mitigation policies. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Disruption; Dynamics; Out of sequence; Productivity; Progress","Dynamics; Heuristic methods; Project management; Construction management; Construction projects; Disruption; Industry applications; Out of sequences; Progress; Research methodologies; System dynamics model; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049211136

Our model captures this interaction by developing two closely related models: an abandonment model and a queueing model. In the abandonment model, customers take the virtual waiting time distribution as given. Class k customers receive a reward rk from service and incur a cost ck per period of waiting. Customers are forward looking and make wait or abandon decisions dynamically to maximize their expected discounted utilities. The queueing model takes the customers' abandonment time distribution as an input and studies the resulting virtual waiting time distribution. Because the multiclass queueing system is not amenable to exact analysis, we resort to an approximate analysis in the conventional heavy traffic limit (under the hazard rate scaling). Leveraging the so-called state-space collapse property, we provide a characterization of the system performance. Combining the results for the two models, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium in which the customers' abandonment time and the virtual waiting time for the various classes are consistent in the two models. Finally, we provide a computational scheme to calculate the equilibrium numerically and apply that using data from an Israeli bank call center. © 2017 INFORMS.","Endogenous abandonments; Heavy traffic; Queueing systems","Queueing networks; Sales; Approximate analysis; Computational schemes; Endogenous abandonments; Heavy traffics; Multi-class queueing systems; Queueing system; State-space collapse; Waiting time distributions; Queueing theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042851861

Specifically, an autoregressive conditional Fréchet (AcF) model is proposed in which the maxima are modeled by a Fréchet distribution with time-varying scale parameter (volatility) and shape parameter (tail index) conditioned on past information. The AcF provides a direct and accurate modeling of the time-varying behavior of maxima and furthermore offers a new angle to study the tail risk dynamics in financial markets. Probabilistic properties of AcF are studied, and a maximum likelihood estimator is used for model estimation, with its statistical properties investigated. Simulations show the flexibility of AcF and confirm the reliability of its estimators. Two real data examples on cross-sectional stock returns and high-frequency foreign exchange returns are used to demonstrate the AcF modeling approach, where significant improvement over the static GEV has been observed for market tail risk monitoring and conditional VaR estimation. Empirical result of AcF is consistent with the findings of the dynamic peak-over-threshold (POT) literature that the tail index of financial markets varies through time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic modeling; Extreme value theory; Financial risk management; Generalized extreme value distribution; High-frequency data; Value at risk","Commerce; Dynamic models; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Frequency estimation; Investments; Maximum likelihood estimation; Risk management; Risk perception; Value engineering; Wind effects; Extreme value theory; Financial risk management; Generalized extreme value distribution; High frequency data; Value at Risk; Fluorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053384954

This paper recategorizes the well-identified sustainability initiatives based on a time dimension and empirically validates the categorization. Structural equation modeling analyses were performed using data collected from 284 Chinese automotive firms. The results suggest that various lean and reactive green practices can be categorized as “short-term sustainability initiatives” because the effects of implementing these practices can be seen in a short time. Specifically, the benefits of implementing short-term sustainability initiatives can be further strengthened and reinforced in the long run by implementing corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. In addition, our findings demonstrate that to fully realize the potential associated with CSR practices, firms need to be orientated to the long term and adopt a wait and watch approach.

However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics © 2018 The Authors","Africa; Forests; Geographic determinants; Household surveys; Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs); Wild foods","Food supply; Forestry; Population statistics; Surveys; Africa; Forests; Geographic determinants; Household surveys; Non-timber forest products; Wild food; Rural areas; Africa; Characteristics; Collection; Food; Forestry; Forests; Sites; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052144538

For many entrepreneurial ventures, data collection and analysis techniques and technologies are becoming an important source to manage uncertainty. This trend is often referred to as 'data-driven entrepreneurship.' We consider a dynamic approach using data to overcome market uncertainty for business opportunity-related evaluations. In particular, we examine the entrepreneur's investment portfolio in which each investment generates expected returns and some information about a specific aspect of the market for a single business opportunity. We develop a model that analyzes imperfect market data (e.g., financial, social, regulatory), while factoring in the entrepreneur's risk preference and operational shortages of resources, routines, reputation, and regulations. Our numerical findings show that, rather than pursuing the highest expected returns, an entrepreneur may choose perfect information, risk hedging, or market-controlling investments based on his/her cash level and risk preference. Hence, the entrepreneur, fueled by the availability of data analysis, could overcome uncertainties and obtain better insights for business opportunity decisions. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Business opportunity evaluation; data-driven entrepreneurship; decision making under uncertainty; entrepreneurship; operational entrepreneurship; operations management (OM); partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP)","Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision making; Financial markets; Markov processes; Uncertainty analysis; Business opportunities; Data driven; Decision making under uncertainty; entrepreneurship; operational entrepreneurship; Operations management; Partially observed markov decision process; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048006071

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a novel combination of triangulated methods comprising a systematic literature review (SLR), text mining and network analysis. These methods have not been jointly utilized in past studies, and the approach constitutes a rigorous methodology that cross-validates results and ensures the reliability and validity of qualitative data. Findings: The study reveals a number of key themes in the field of SCRM and security linked with terrorism. The authors identify relevant mitigation strategies and practices for effective strategic decision making. This subsequently leads us to develop a strategic framework of strategies and effective decision-making practices to address terrorism-related risk, affecting SCRM and security. The authors also identify key knowledge gaps in the literature and explore the main contributions by disciplines (e.g. business schools, engineering and maritime institutions) and countries. Practical implications: The authors provide a strategic framework of strategies and effective decision-making practices that managers can use to minimize terrorism-related risk in the context of SCRM and security. Originality/value: This paper introduces a novel methodological combination for improving the quality of SLRs. It uses the approach to systematically review the strategies and effective decision-making practices interlinked with terrorism risk, affecting SCRM and security.

However, which is better than another? To address this issue, an energy return on investment (EROI) analysis, which is a useful method to evaluate the physical performance of an energy process, is applied. Besides, the EROIs time series of offshore domestic oil and gas and onshore domestic oil and gas are calculated, and the causes of the change tendency of EROIs time series are studied. The EROIs of imported oil and gas from different import countries are also calculated, laying the foundation for optimization of the import structure from an EROI perspective. Moreover, environmental inputs, which cause the externality of an energy process, are also studied. The results show that the EROIs of the entire domestic oil and gas fluctuate between 8.5 and 12, and the EROIs of the imported oil and gas lie in the range between 2.9 and 9.5. We conclude that: 1) The EROIs of domestic oil and gas is higher than those of imported oil and gas, indicating that domestic oil and gas has a higher physical efficiency than imported oil and gas. 2) The change tendency of EROIs is influenced by the extractions of natural gas. Moreover, the EROIs of imported oil and gas are additionally related to oil and gas prices. 3) From an EROI perspective, LNG and pipeline gas are better than imported crude oil. Australia, Kazakhstan, and the USA should be prioritized for China to import LNG, pipeline gas, and crude oil respectively. 4) Environmental inputs reduce the EROIs. Therefore more caution should be paid on the reduction of environmental inputs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Domestic oil and gas; Energy return on investment; Environmental inputs; Imported oil and gas; Optimization of import structure","Crude oil; Investments; Pipelines; Profitability; Structural optimization; Time series; Change tendencies; Domestic oil; Economic growths; Energy return on investments; Environmental inputs; Oil and gas; Oil and gas prices; Physical performance; Gases; petroleum; crude oil; economic growth; import; investment; natural gas; optimization; price dynamics; Article; Australia; China; controlled study; economic aspect; energy return on investment; investment; Kazakhstan; offshore oil industry; oil industry; United States; Australia; China; Kazakhstan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045701546

To confront these challenges, hospitals are placing an increased emphasis on process excellence. We use process excellence to denote a hospital's ability to, on average, treat a patient in the most effective and efficient manner. We use actual improvements in cost per discharge (CPD), average length of stay (ALOS), and conformance quality (ConfQual), to assess changes in a hospital's level of process excellence. In this paper, we investigate empirically the association between process excellence and overall measures of hospital performance, including market share and profitability. To this end, we leverage secondary data sources and regression analysis to track over time the performance of 288 short-term acute care hospitals located in California. Our analysis leads to several important implications. First, we find that a hospital's focus on improving CPD and ALOS, is associated with higher inpatient market share, whereas improvements in ConfQual are negatively associated with market share. Second, improvements in CPD are associated with higher profitability while there is no direct relationship between improvements in both ALOS and ConfQual and profitability. Third, CPD is found to mediate the relationship between both ALOS and ConfQual and hospital performance.

Design/methodology/approach: Structured questionnaires were designed based on literature review and a pilot study, and administered to public and private clients in Nigeria’s construction industry. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to analyse the data. Findings: The result shows that while clients’ attitudes towards H&S are not encouraging, public clients commitment and attitudes are better than that of private clients. This is emphasised by the significant difference between the categories of clients and: accident investigation; clients auditing contractors H&S records at the preconstruction stage. The common client H&S practice includes conducting site visits and inspections and attending H&S meetings, while engaging in H&S awareness and H&S audit during construction are not common. However, when clients are involved in H&S, it has resulted in a reduction in accidents, compensation claims, rework and improved the relationship between clients and contractors. Practical implications: The findings form a basis for improving client involvement in H&S (factoring in the differences in clients) which policymakers, the construction industry and academics will find beneficial.

This paper presents a forecast combination model that adaptively identifies the best forecast and optimises various combinations of commonly used project cost forecasting models. To do so, a forecast error simulator is formulated to visualise and quantify likely error profiles of forecast models and their combinations. The adaptive cost combination (ACC) model was applied to a pilot project for numerical illustration as well as to real world projects for practical implementation. The results provide three valuable insights into more effective project control and forecasting. First, the best forecasting model may change in individual projects according to the project progress and the management priority (i.e. accuracy, outperformance or large errors). Second, adaptive combination of simple, index-based forecasts tends to improve forecast accuracy, while mitigating the risk of large errors. Third, a post-mortem analysis of seven real projects indicated that the simple average of two most commonly used cost forecasts can be 31.2% more accurate, on average, than the most accurate alternative forecasts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive combination; cost forecast; Project control; simulation","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Errors; Project management; Adaptive combinations; Forecast accuracy; Forecast combinations; Forecasting modeling; Post mortem analysis; Project control; Real world projects; simulation; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046420259

Firms’ strategies in three decision models (Nash Equilibrium decision, partially centralised decision and totally centralised decision) are analysed. We provide some quantitative analyses on how some parameters affect firms’ decisions in the three decision models. Our Nash Equilibrium analysis shows that when firms make decisions individually, they will share no information with each other. When information sharing is determined by a social planner, firms will share some information with each other, which increases the risk of information leakage. Thus, firms should increase their security investments to mitigate the higher information leakage risk. However, our analysis shows that instead of investing more in information security, firms will reduce their security investment, which will further aggravate the risk. Hence, a social planner is required to designate the security investments and information sharing levels for both firms. Our theoretical analysis shows that firms’ strategies can achieve global optimality in the totally centralised decision model. Furthermore, a numerical experiment is conducted and the result demonstrates that totally centralised decision model is more efficient than the other two decision models. At last, we propose two compensation mechanisms to help firms coordinate their strategies when making decisions individually. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","compensation mechanism; information security investment; information sharing; IoT; Nash equilibrium; optimal solution","Computation theory; Game theory; Information analysis; Investments; Risk assessment; Security of data; Compensation mechanism; Information security investment; Information sharing; Nash equilibria; Optimal solutions; Information dissemination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033712618

We conducted an empirical study in the manufacturing industry and found support for the study model, in which the indirect effect of corporate foresight on innovativeness through organisational learning was conditional on the level of integrative capabilities.

Each customer arrives with a preference list and will purchase the highest-ranking offered product in her preference list. We assume the set of customer classes is derived from paths in a tree, in which the order of nodes visited along each path gives the corresponding preference list. First, we study assortment problems, in which the goal is to find which products to offer to maximize expected revenue. We give a dynamic programming solution, which can be extended to versions of the assortment problem in which there are fixed costs for offering a product, shelf constraints, or substitution costs. Second, we study the joint assortment and pricing problem, in which the goal is to simultaneously select the set of offered products as well as their prices.We solve the pricing problem optimally when customers have some universal ranking of the products, and hence the tree takes the form of a single path. We also solve the problem optimally on the general tree when the prices are restricted to be quality consistent; higher-quality products must be priced above lower-quality products. Finally, we present computational experiments on both synthetic data and real hotel purchase data.

This paper investigates the wage differential between venture capital-backed startups and established firms, given that the two firm types compete for talent. Using data on MIT graduates, I find that non-founder employees at VC-backed startups earn roughly 10% higher wages than their counterparts at established firms. To account for unobserved heterogeneity across workers, I exploit the fact that many MIT graduates receive multiple job offers. I find that wage differentials are statistically insignificant from zero when individual fixed effects are included. This implies that much of the startup wage premium in the cross-section can be attributed to selection, and that VC-backed startups pay competitive wages for talent. To unpack the selection mechanism, I show that individual preferences for risk as well as challenging work strongly predict entry into VC-backed startups. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurship; Hiring; Selection bias; Startups; Venture capital; Wage differential","Investments; Wages; Entrepreneurship; Hiring; Selection bias; Startups; Venture Capital; Wage differentials; Compensation (personnel)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041620037

Moreover, the knowledge based view (KBV) has long suggested that due to stronger cognitive links within firms, internal compared to external service provision creates better conditions for knowledge sharing. Empirical evidence for this claim is however scarce, and the KBV does not explain the mechanisms for more knowledge sharing in internal sourcing in detail. Moreover, there is now some evidence to suggest that firms’ relationships with external sourcing partners are becoming more similar to those with captive centres, which represent a less traditional form of insourcing setting. To scrutinize the possible knowledge sharing advantages of internal sourcing in more depth, we turn to social capital (SC) research. There are some theoretical claims that SC and knowledge sharing are stronger within than between firms, and there is ample evidence that SC facilitates knowledge sharing. Our survey results suggest that the extent of knowledge sharing and SC are indeed stronger in a captive than in an external sourcing mode, and that structural (tie strength), cognitive (shared understanding), and relational (trust) aspects of SC mediate the effect of sourcing mode on the extent of knowledge sharing. By contrast, network stability (a structural aspect) mediated knowledge sharing only indirectly, by reinforcing the other SC aspects. We highlight important contributions to research and practice of IS outsourcing and social capital. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Surveys; Is outsourcings; Knowledge-based views; Knowledge-sharing; Network stability; Service provisions; Shared understanding; Social capitals; Structural aspects; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019390048

Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical underpinnings of this conceptual study include appraisal theory of emotions. Propositions are presented that suggest positive relationships between antecedent variables, EI and trust, contrasted with the dependent variable, organizational learning. Findings: Organizational learning is generally considered to be a benign activity, created by the acquisition and dissemination of new information. The outcome of organizational learning is the development of new knowledge that ultimately results in a shared interpretation among members of the organization. This paper suggests that a lack of EI, defined as “the ability to perceive and express emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, understand and reason with emotion, and regulate emotion in the self and others” (Mayer et al., 2000, p. 396), casts doubt on the motives of newly acquired information. Consequently, low levels of EI can inhibit the acceptance of new information, leading to a reduction of learning by the organization. Originality/value: This paper extends the concept of organizational learning by incorporating EI and trust as antecedents of organizational learning. Previous research suggests a direct relationship between information acquisition, dissemination and organizational learning. This study implies that other factors can intervene after information is acquired, thereby affecting whether newly acquired information is fully incorporated into the organizational learning process. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emotional intelligence; Organizational learning; Sales; Trade shows; Trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042063937

The paper begins by synthesising the literature on social preferences from the field of behavioural economics and social psychology with the discourse surrounding behavioural operations management and humanitarian operations management. By doing so, we identify the motivators, enablers and barriers of local citizen response during disaster relief operations. These factors inform a theoretical framework of the social preferences motivating spontaneous volunteerism in post-disaster situations. We evidence facets of the framework using archival and unstructured data retrieved from Twitter feeds generated by local citizens during the floods that hit Chennai, India in 2015.

The empirical study uses panel data of 160 Chinese cities and a time span over 2000–2015. To capture the characteristics of the panel models, including the individual effects, variable intercepts, and coefficient values, different regression functions are adopted for the relevant analysis. As for these regression functions, seven explanatory variables are selected. These variables are: the length of operated bus transit routes (LR), the total number of annual passengers trips (PT), the land area for urban roads (LA), the density of urban road networks (ND), the resident population (POP), the gross domestic production (GDP), and the value-added tax (TAX). On the other hand, the explained variable in these regression models is the AIP of each city. According to model results, it is found that AIP is positively related to LR and GDP, and negatively to PT, LA, and TAX. However, the effects of ND and POP are negative on the increase of AIPs of mega-cities and medium-size cities. It could also be found that the increase in bus infrastructure investment caused by the expansion of land area for urban roads is not negligible, especially in small cities. When the LR changes greatly, LA should be considered as a more stable factor to predict the AIP in mega-cities. Based on the findings, related implications for the policy-making on annual budget allocations for different tiers of cities are listed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Annual investment; China; Land area for urban roads; Panel model; Public transport; Road network density","Budget control; Buses; Internet protocols; Investments; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Annual investments; China; Panel model; Public transport; Road network; Urban road; Urban transportation; investment; public transport; road; urban area; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033475845

In this paper, we consider an investment decision involving a sustainable, energy efficient, greenhouse gases (GHG) reducing asset and incorporate the value of carbon emission allowances for the investing company. These allowances create cash flows that may be characterized by significant volatility and uncertainty. The methodology developed in this paper allows decision makers to integrate their knowledge of carbon trading markets and the cash flows that result from sale of emissions credits. The novel methodology utilizes a Bayesian model for IRR that uses Gibbs sampler. Analysis of the results shows that IRR is influenced by volatility and uncertainty of carbon credit cash flows. Ignoring those uncertainty characteristics and simply using the expected values of cash flows can result in significantly inaccurate investment rate of returns. When compared to deterministic IRR calculations, the results show that the occurrence of very high and very low cash flows affects IRR positively, whereas higher variability of cash flow distribution affects IRR of GHG-reducing asset negatively. In other words, frequent large or small cash flows are preferred over fluctuating cash flows. The results may also provide a rationale for the existence of an anomalous consumer behavior known as the energy efficiency gap. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian analysis; Carbon emission credits and offsets; Emission reduction; Gibbs sampler; Internal rate of return; Investment appraisal","Bayesian networks; Budget control; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Earnings; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian Analysis; Carbon emissions; Emission reduction; Gibbs samplers; Internal rate of return; Investment appraisal; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014374340

Focusing on the recent rapid rise of one platform, cloud computing, we assemble a unique dataset to look at the period just before wide acceptance of the cloud. We find evidence of complementarity between VC financing and the introduction of new products offered over the cloud. Moreover, the complementarity effects are significantly stronger for firms backed by VCs that had rich experience in the IT industry and are significantly weaker for firms that had prior experience developing traditional client/server products.

The objective of the model is to maximise the total social welfare, which includes consumer surplus and operator's net profit. The model is solved by a heuristic solution procedure and tested on an idealized linear travel corridor. The case study considers the effects from population density, density distribution, size of residential area, P&R station location, distance from the residential area to centre business area (CBD), as well as the changes of residential area layout and population growth. Results show that P&R fits for low population density area while ODPB is more suitable for high population density area. Population distribution type has little influence on the services’ social welfare. ODPB is a preferable service for the city which does not have advanced metro network. Besides, the investment time for building ODPB service in the planning horizon is discussed with consideration of the development of residential area. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","On-demand public bus; Park and ride; Public transport; Service selection; Social welfare","Bus transportation; Buses; Decision making; Housing; Investments; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Subways; On demands; Park-and-ride; Public transport; Service selection; Social welfare; Population distribution; bus transport; park and ride; population growth; public transport; residential location; service quality; travel demand; welfare provision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055703129

As such, GGR is an increasingly critical topic for UK climate policy. So far, GGR research has focused on top-down assessment of techno-environmental potential and carbon abatement costs - an approach which aids integrated assessment modelling but does not provide the commercially relevant analysis necessary to understand potential routes to market for this sector. This research reduces this knowledge gap by employing a novel bottom-up perspective to determine the financial opportunities available to GGR business models in Biomass heavy UK energy scenarios. This delivers results relevant to national and sectorial policy and decision making, by quantifying revenue opportunities from future GGR value chains, as well as business model performance. It also informs the innovation, policy, and regulatory environment required to ensure market development and resilience of different revenue streams. The work concludes that energy market policy - specifically access to a carbon credit mechanism - has by far the greatest near term opportunity to drive the negative emissions technologies we assess. This is because the values in this market far outweigh those in related supply chains such as: enhanced oil recovery, afforestation payments, biochar markets, and industry and commercial uses of captured carbon. This data shows that negative emissions technologies in the UK, should not be led by agricultural and land use policy, but should be integrated with energy policy. To do this, the development of a carbon storage credit mechanism analogous to the existing carbon price floor is key. As a proof of concept for a novel method to generate commercially relevant insights for GGR scale up, the research clearly demonstrates that the value pool method provides critical insights to assist GGR development and could form the basis of further work. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Business models; Commercial delivery; Energy policy; Greenhouse gas removal; Negative emissions; Value pool","Binary alloys; Commerce; Decision making; Digital storage; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Reforestation; Supply chains; Business models; Commercial delivery; Enhanced oil recovery; Global temperatures; Integrated assessment modelling; Market development; Regulatory environment; Value pool; Energy policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053468275

In this setting, the seller could potentially extract the entire buyer surplus by running e cient auctions and charging an upfront participation fee at the beginning of the horizon. In some markets, such as Internet advertising, participation fees are not practical since buyers expect to inspect items before purchasing them. This motivates us to study the design of dynamic mechanisms under successively more stringent requirements that capture the implicit business constraints of these markets. We first consider a periodic individual rationality constraint, which limits the mechanism to charge at most the buyer’s value in each period. While this prevents large upfront participation fees, the seller can still design mechanisms that spread a participation fee across multiple initial auctions. These mechanisms have the unappealing feature that they provide close-to-zero buyer utility in earlier auctions in exchange for higher utility in later auctions. To address this problem, we introduce a martingale utility constraint, which imposes the requirement that from the perspective of the buyer, the next item’s expected utility is equal to the present one’s. Our main result is providing a dynamic auction satisfying martingale utility and periodic individual rationality whose loss in profit with respect to first-best (full extraction of buyer surplus) is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. The proposed mechanism is a dynamic two-tier auction with a hard floor and a soft floor that allocates the item whenever the buyer’s bid is above the hard floor and charges the minimum of the bid and the soft floor. © 2017 INFORMS.","Approximations; Dynamic auctions; Dynamic mechanism design; Internet advertising; Martingales; Revenue management","Commerce; Floors; Machine design; Sales; Approximations; Dynamic mechanism; Internet advertising; Martingales; Revenue management; Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056297119

Using detailed data on division manager compensation and divestiture activity, this study documents that firms are more likely to divest divisions when pay inequality among division managers is higher. To address potential bias in the measurement of pay inequality, we construct a “synthetic” measure that varies with regional and industry pay shocks that differentially affect division managers within firms. Post hoc analyses reveal that social comparison appears to explain, at least partially, the relationship between unequal pay and divestiture. These findings support the notion that pay inequality can be an important predictor of firm boundaries. More generally, they suggest that unequal pay may have significant strategic consequences as firms increasingly adopt performance-based compensation to motivate employees. Managerial Summary: This paper analyzes the link between the degree of inequality in division manager compensation and the likelihood that companies divest businesses. We find that companies are more likely to divest when the pay of their division managers is more widely dispersed. Supplementary analyses show that this relationship is stronger when division managers are more likely to compare their pay to that of their peers, for example, within companies whose divisions operate in more closely related industries or in more proximate geographic regions. These findings show that pay inequality can predict when companies choose to exit businesses. As such, it is relevant for understanding how corporate strategy is influenced by performance-based compensation policies, particularly as these policies become the norm in companies around the world. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","diseconomies of scope; divestitures; firm boundaries; pay inequality; social comparison","Management; Planning; diseconomies of scope; divestitures; Firm boundaries; pay inequality; social comparison; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053758676

We develop a model that formalizes a mechanism to allow for the influence of external debt in the transmission of FDI-generated externalities and conduct threshold regressions to test the existence of a debt contingency effect that limits the positive impact of inward FDI on growth. With the use of annual as well as 5-year averaged data for 39 developing countries over the period 1984–2010, our findings support the hypothesis that FDI-induced growth is dependent on the external debt constraint. In particular, we show that beyond a certain threshold high indebtedness constrains economies from reaping growth benefits from FDI as they seek to reduce their debt levels. In this scenario, the evidence also shows that increasing financial development can mitigate the negative influence of high external debt on the FDI–growth nexus. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Economic growth; external debt; foreign direct investment; threshold estimation","debt; developing world; economic growth; estimation method; financial system; foreign direct investment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050520976

While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice—lead director adoption—that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform—appointing a lead director—finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management.

Given its increasing application and superior performance in comparison to other methods, it is pertinent to study and distinguish between the two forecasting variations of SSA. These are referred to as Vector SSA (SSA-V) and Recurrent SSA (SSA-R). The general notion is that SSA-V is more robust and provides better forecasts than SSA-R. This is especially true when faced with time series which are non-stationary and asymmetric, or affected by unit root problems, outliers or structural breaks.

Rank-based and dominance-based customer selections are widely used for the market analysis to find prospective customers. However, rank-based solutions required companies to define weight vectors, which is not practical in real applications. Dominance-based approaches (e.g., reverse skyline queries) had problems of a high overhead and the poor progressiveness. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient framework to find prospective customers for a target product. We first target on the most prospective customers for whom no better product exists compared with the target product. We formulate the problem based on reverse skyline queries, and propose a new algorithm that significantly reduces the query cost by pruning unqualified customers without any false positive and identifies reverse skyline points as early as possible based on decision region and effect region. We then further target on arbitrary k prospective customers and formulate the problem as top-k reverse skyline (top-k RS) queries. We extend the notion of reverse skyline to reverse skyline order in order to support arbitrary k and group-based promotions. We evaluate our framework with extensive experiments, and our results demonstrate that our framework has the promising results for reverse skyline queries, and can efficiently support top-k RS queries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Competitive products; Cost-efficient; Prospective customers; Reverse skyline","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Competitive products; Cost-efficient; Customer selections; Market competition; Prospective customers; Real applications; Reverse skyline; Reverse skyline queries; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045737517

Recent research shows the drawbacks of focusing solely on predictive power when evaluating recommender systems, which become especially prominent in job- and job seeker recommendation, where aspects such as reciprocity and item spread are two other vital performance metrics for the quality of recommendations. Besides evaluating using these extra metrics, we compare recommendation with search using free text search engines. We measure what is gained, and what is lost when consuming items (jobs and job seekers) retrieved using search versus items presented via a recommender system. Based on insights in date recommendation literature, we propose changes to rating matrix construction aimed at mitigating the drawbacks of recommendation in the labor market. Our results, obtained from extensive experimentation on three datasets gathered from the Flemish public employment services, show that popular recommender algorithms perform significantly worse than user search in terms of reciprocity. Furthermore, we show that by swapping the rating matrices between two sides of a reciprocal recommender context, we can outperform user search in terms of reciprocity with limited trade off in predictive power.

In this paper, we extend the analysis to include inter-itinerary competition along three dimensions: nonstop versus connecting level of service, carrier, and time of day using nested logit (NL) and ordered generalized extreme value (OGEV) models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first NL and OGEV itinerary choice models to correct for price endogeneity. Despite the many structural changes that have occurred in the airline industry, our results are strikingly similar to models estimated more than a decade ago. These results are important because it suggests that customer preferences, on average, have been stable over time and are similar across distribution channels. The stability in inter-itinerary competition patterns provides an important practical implication for airlines, namely it reduces the need to frequently update the parameter estimates for these models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air travel behavior; Itinerary choice; Nested logit; Ordered generalized extreme value models","Public policy; Transportation; Air travels; Airline passengers; Customer preferences; Discrete choice models; Distribution channel; Generalized extreme value; Itinerary choice; Nested logit; Air transportation; air transportation; airline industry; competition (economics); discrete choice analysis; numerical model; regression analysis; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046338779

We provide specific insights into the mechanism underlying the complex relationship between a firm’s productivity in existing services, its innovation proactivity, and its service innovation success.

The SupF type tests are motivated by alternatives where the parameters display a small number of breaks at deterministic points in the sample, while the Cramer–von-Mises alternative is one where the coefficients are random and slowly evolve through time. In order to allow for an unknown degree of persistence in the predictors, and for both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity in the data, we implement the tests using a fixed regressor wild bootstrap procedure. The asymptotic validity of the bootstrap tests is established by showing that the asymptotic distributions of the bootstrap parameter constancy statistics, conditional on the data, coincide with those of the asymptotic null distributions of the corresponding statistics computed on the original data, conditional on the predictors. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the bootstrap parameter stability tests work well in finite samples, with the tests based on the Cramer–von-Mises principle seemingly the most useful in practice.

Providers must compete for consumer attention to sell their digital information goods effectively. This is challenging, since there is a high level of uncertainty associated with the consumption of such goods. Service providers often use free programming to share product information. We examine the effectiveness of content sampling strategy used for on-demand series dramas, a unique class of entertainment goods. The data were extracted from a large set of household video-on-demand (VoD) viewing records and combined with external data sources. We extended a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to handle censored data, which permitted us to explore the main causal relationships. Relevant theories in the marketing and information systems disciplines informed our research on consumer involvement and informedness for decision making under uncertainty, the consumption of information goods, and seller strategies for digital content. The results show that content sampling stimulates higher demand for series dramas, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Samples of the series reveal quality information to consumers and allow them to assess preference fit directly. As a result, they become more informed about their purchase decisions. Also, households seem to be willing to pay more to be better informed, and informed households tend to purchase more. This suggests that content providers should invest in strategies that help consumers to understand the preference fit of information goods.

Our approach is based on the functional partial least squares (FPLS) model, which is capable of avoiding multicollinearity in regression by efficiently extracting information from the high-dimensional market data. By using its well-known ability, we can incorporate auxiliary variables that improve the predictive accuracy. We provide an empirical application of our proposed methodology in terms of its ability to predict the conditional average log return and the volatility of crude oil prices via exponential smoothing, Bayesian stochastic volatility, and GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) models, respectively. In particular, what we call functional data analysis (FDA) traces in this article are obtained via the FPLS regression from both the crude oil returns and auxiliary variables of the exchange rates of major currencies. For forecast performance evaluation, we compare out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of the standard models with FDA traces to the accuracy of the same forecasting models with the observed crude oil returns, principal component regression (PCR), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models. We find evidence that the standard models with FDA traces significantly outperform our competing models. Finally, they are also compared with the test for superior predictive ability and the reality check for data snooping.

In such systems, customers typically hang up and abandon the system if their wait for service is too long. Such abandonments are detrimental for the system, and so managers typically use scheduling as a tool to mitigate it. In this paper, we study the interplay between customer impatience and scheduling decisions when managing heterogeneous customer classes. Academic/practical relevance: Call centers constitute a large industry that has a global spending of around $300 billion and employs more than 15 million people worldwide. Our work focuses on improving call center operations, which can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Mathematically, customer patience is typically modeled as exponentially distributed for tractability. Our work makes inroads into relaxing this restrictive assumption to allow modeling more realistic call center situations. Methodology: We use heavy traffic-motivated asymptotic queueing machinery that provides us the traction to successfully capture and incorporate the customer impatience distribution into the scheduling problem. In our approach, the scheduling problem reduces to a diffusion control problem, which we solve to propose near-optimal scheduling policies. Results: We propose near-optimal scheduling policies that can be implemented by call centers to improve their quality-of-service metrics. One of our main results is that, for a class of parameters, we establish sufficient conditions for both the optimality and nonoptimality of threshold policies. Managerial implications: Threshold policies are widely used for scheduling. Our work provides additional insight into whether these may be suboptimal. Our work provides an easy-to-implement alternative that can reduce customer abandonments considerably; for instance, our numerical results indicate that for a system with two customer types, the abandonment rate of one class can be lowered by 30% by using our policy relative to the best threshold policy. © 2018 INFORMS.","Diffusion analysis; Dynamic scheduling; General patience times; Impatient customers; Service operations","Machinery; Managers; Quality of service; Sales; Scheduling; Diffusion analysis; Dynamic scheduling; General patience times; Impatient customers; Service operations; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047136814

In doing this, we study the relative dynamic pricing implications of how current retail and wholesale prices for a brand must optimally take into account past and future demand, respectively, for the brand. Using scanner data from the cola market, we find that while the retailer exploits the benefit of inertial demand by appropriately increasing the retail profit margin, the cost of investing is borne entirely by the manufacturers. We use simulation studies to show how the retailer will lose its ability to leverage the benefits of inertial demand as consumers become more price sensitive. We also show that when inertia of the more price-sensitive customer segment increases, the aggregate welfare of consumers, the retailer, and manufacturers may increase. © 2016 INFORMS.","Distribution channel; Dynamic pricing; Structural econometric models; Switching costs","Competition; Manufacture; Sales; Customer segments; Distribution channel; Dynamic pricing; Econometric model; Relative dynamics; Simulation studies; Switching costs; Whole sale prices; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045205113

These firms have recently begun to compete on electronic markets by selling goods and services through local daily deal sites, such as Groupon and LivingSocial. We extract publicly available activity and spatial information from Groupon, LivingSocial, Google Maps, and Flickr to construct a unique panel data set to study daily deals offered by restaurants and spa vendors in geographical clusters of concentration in 167 distinct cities. This data set allows us to examine the effect of location on the competition vendors face in electronic markets.We find that as vendors in a particular geographical cluster participate in electronic markets, local competition increases and other vendors in that cluster join the electronic market and deepen discounts in response. However, vendors in other clusters in the same city remain relatively unaffected.We further analyze vendor ratings from Yelp and other infomediaries, to show that lesser known and low-quality vendors utilize the advertising effect of electronic markets to increase their awareness among customers. We further test the moderating effect of horizontal and vertical differentiation among firms in geographical clusters on competition in electronic markets, using measures extracted from UrbanSpoon.com. We find that clusters having lower differentiation experience higher competitive effects of firms joining the electronic market.

In this study, we address three key components of the SLA-based cloud resource management and pricing problem, from the service-provider's perspective: (1) availability-aware backup resource provisioning; (2) price-penalty schedule determination; and (3) penalty-deferred pricing over two periods. Using the convexity of the provider's expected total cost over the number of backup resources, we present a dichotomous search algorithm to derive the total cost minimizing number of backup resources for a given level of SLA-specified service availability guarantee. Next, we derive closed-form solutions for the lower bound of the feasible price range, yielding a schedule of breakeven price-penalty combinations, which establishes the baseline required in the economic modeling of the service contracts and related negotiation processes, and may also elicit client preference information. We then model a two-period pricing problem specifically designed to incentivize penalty deferrals in the event of an SLA violation. Detailed experimental studies of the proposed models have been carried out using real-world datacenter log data. The computational study validates the convexity of the probability density function of SLA violations over the number of backup resources. The results demonstrate significant interaction effects between the SLA parameters (price, penalty rate, and provisioning cost) and the backup resource provisioning decisions made by the provider, leading to key practical managerial implications for SLA design and resource deployment in the availability-aware cloud. © 2018 INFORMS.","Cloud computing; Pricing; Resource management; Service level agreement","Availability; Cloud computing; Economic and social effects; Natural resources management; Probability density function; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Closed form solutions; Computational studies; Managerial implications; Preference information; Resource deployments; Resource management; Service availability; Service Level Agreements; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062154944

This has given shape to a central state-led policy regime that has sought to ensure that planners and other urban policy makers develop plans and strategies that support construction activity. Against this backdrop, and a recent history of uneven spatial development, this paper seeks to understand what this policy imperative might mean for housing construction activity in different provinces. It seeks to reflect on both the relationship between the state and the market, and the interaction between state policies, economic drivers and levels of construction activity. The evidence presented in the paper suggests that uneven spatial development might be explained in different ways in different provinces. Although, in many cases, patterns of construction activity are consistent with economic fundamentals, there are important exceptions in some regions where arguably activity levels are at odds with prior expectations. © 2018 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The method used both questionnaire and company proprietary data to measure the predicted SPC outcomes through structural equation modeling. The research data were obtained from employees, customers and management at five restaurants in one casual theme restaurant chain in Australia. Findings: The findings indicate that revenue may be a more appropriate outcome than profit in the SPC, that context and individual unit circumstances matter and that there may be a time lag between organizational actions, employee behavior, customer satisfaction and financial outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Because of the nature of field research, there are limitations. As restaurants were added during the study, data per unit were impacted. Moreover, budgetary constraints limited the number of customer surveys. Nonetheless, the data set includes management, customer, employee and proprietary financial measures which are rarely available in the research literature. These data allow a thorough study of the SPC that provides both important findings and a model for future investigations into the SPC. Practical implications: As the SPC is a widely cited model used to explain the linkages between managerial and organizational actions and financial outcomes as they work through employee interactions with customers, the findings suggest that the chain may have a more direct impact on revenue than profit. Moreover, the data strongly suggest that context matters as the unique context of the restaurants had important influences on financial outcomes. The findings also indicate that a time lag exists between managerial and organizational actions and financial outcomes, suggesting that it can take time for such actions to ripple through the SPC. Originality/value: Structural equation modeling and standardized measures allowed the authors to overcome prior limitations in SPC research. Moreover, SPC researchers seldom have access to the proprietary data that enabled a test of the entire SPC. Consequently, this study contributes new insights into this classic model’s value in predicting and explaining financial outcomes resulting from the actions of an organization’s leadership influencing employee behavior toward customers in the restaurant industry. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Leadership; Management; Service climate; Service-profit chain; Time lags",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041735202

We find that individuals who generate a business idea form biased evaluations of the economic potential of ideas, be it their own idea or somebody else's idea. On the one hand, they are overconfident about the value of, and overly likely to invest in, their own idea. On the other hand, when investing in another person's idea, even if it is not competing with their own idea, they are underconfident about the value of, and insufficiently likely to invest in, the idea. Surprisingly, we find that entrepreneurial experience exacerbates this pattern of over- A nd underconfidence. In addition, we find that the threat that another investor can appropriate a declined investment opportunity increases willingness to invest. We propose a theoretical account to explain the observed pattern of over- A nd underconfidence in imitative and innovative entrepreneurship. Our findings challenge the traditional account that lowering the cost of imitation has a disincentive effect on the investment decisions of pioneer entrepreneurs and provide evidence that a more lenient appropriability regime may, unexpectedly, have positive effects on entrepreneurship. Our findings also identify new psychological mechanisms that can play a role in important phenomena such as the emergence of spin-offs and rush to market entry.","Entrepreneurship; Imitation; Investment; Overconfidence; Takeover aversion","Investments; Appropriability regimes; Economic potentials; Entrepreneurship; Imitation; Investment decisions; Investment opportunities; Overconfidence; Takeover aversion; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041381684

First, every quarter around 8 percent of products are reallocated in the economy, and the entry and exit of products are prevalent among different types of firms. Second, most reallocation of products occurs within the boundaries of the firm. The entries and exits of firms only make a small contribution in the overall creation and destruction of products. Third, product reallocation is strongly pro-cyclical and declined by more than 25 percent during the Great Recession. This cyclical pattern is almost entirely explained by a decline in within firm reallocation. Motivated by these facts, we study the causes and consequences of reallocation within incumbent firms. As predicted by Schumpeterian growth theories, the rate of product reallocation strongly depends on the innovation efforts of the firms and has important implications for revenue growth, improvements in products’ quality, and productivity dynamics.

Results from 48 states during the period 2007 to 2012 suggest the presence of strategic interaction: states increase their EDI spending when their neighbors do so.

Based on the cofounding networks of 9,461 entrepreneurs and 2,446 large-scale industrial enterprises over 45 years in Russia's emerging economy (1869-1913), our findings showthat variation among team members' brokering ability significantly predicts the starting capital raised by their firm. The effect is moderated by the team's average brokering potential. When both the team's average and variation in brokering potential is high, firms raise greater starting capital. By using multiple membership models, we demonstrate that greater starting capital is largely attributable to team factors rather than the attributes of the individual team members.We also take advantage of discriminatory laws thatwere passed in 1887 in an instrumental variable analysis to address potential endogeneity issues. © 2017 The Author(s).","Emerging economies; Entrepreneurial teams; Social networks; Structural roles","Operations research; Social networking (online); Emerging economies; Entrepreneurial teams; Industrial enterprise; Instrumental variables; Membership models; Network characteristics; Structural roles; Team members; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060886618

Using the case of AstraZeneca's antipsychotic drug, Seroquel, I study the extent to which off-label prescriptions are caused by detailing. Using a physician panel that connects detailing exposure to medical charts, I exploit within-physician variation to identify detailing effects. I find the effect of detailing on off-label prescriptions is small in both absolute and relative terms. Detailing on net tilts the prescribing distribution toward on-label.

Taking into account the internal structures is commonly found in many situations such as seller-buyer supply chain, health care provision and environmental management. Contrary to conventional DEA models as a black-box structure, TsDEA provides further insight into sources of inefficiencies and a more informative basis for performance evaluation. In addition, ignoring the qualitative and imprecise data leads to distorted evaluations, both for the subunits and the system efficiency. We present the fuzzy input and output-oriented TsDEA models to calculate the global and pure technical efficiencies of a system and sub-processes when some data are fuzzy. To this end, we propose a possibilistic programming problem and then convert it into a deterministic interval programming problem using the α-level based method. The proposed method preserves the link between two stages in the sense that the total efficiency of the system is equal to the product of the efficiencies derived from two stages. In addition to the study of technical efficiency, this research includes two further contributions to the ancillary literature; firstly, we minutely discuss the efficiency decompositions to indicate the sources of inefficiency and secondly, we present a method for ranking the efficient units in a fuzzy environment. An empirical illustration is also utilised to show the applicability of the proposed technique. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Fuzzy data; Ranking; Two-level systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048053103

The mediating role of the technological and the regional institutional contexts of target firms is also considered. Using data on a large sample of European target firms for 1997-2013, our results support a process of selection whereby MNEs acquire underperforming firms that developed valuable organisational and cognitive routines, as a strategy to access novel knowledge bases while reducing the cost of purchasing foreign assets. © The Author (2017).

However, their industrial adoption is inhibited by high upfront research and development cost. To reduce the cost of material selection as part of such an investment, this work presents the application of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to material selection with a focus on material processability and manufacturing quality. The selection is based on procurement, material and its performance throughout the manufacturing process, and some laminate quality indicators. Criteria and sub-criteria were identified and implemented into the AHP. This established decision making tool was compared to a more efficient derivative using the chain of interaction method. Two materials, including the selected material, were used to manufacture a small-scale L-section composite component. This demonstrates that the proposed material selection method predicted the more preferable material for manufacturing quality when applied to a complex geometry. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Using panel data on S&P 100 companies, we find that pressure felt by management to meet the analyst consensus earnings estimate influences the extent of corporate downsizing. Moreover, our results show that high levels of institutional investor stock ownership and CEO power attenuate managers’ sensitivity to financial market pressures, while high levels of analyst coverage increase their sensitivity. Managerial Summary: In this study we examine how financial market pressures influence managers’ downsizing decisions. We argue that investment analysts’ earnings estimates represent important performance targets to which managers aspire. If firms fail to meet analysts’ expectations, the stock price will suffer. This study shows that managers utilize corporate downsizing to address the potential shortfall between a firm's future performance and the analyst consensus earnings estimate. In addition, we find that managers’ concerns over meeting analysts’ earnings estimates are influenced by various contextual factors such as institutional investor stock ownership, CEO power, and high levels of analyst coverage. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","behavioral theory of the firm; corporate downsizing; earnings estimates; investment analysts; performance feedback","Commerce; Financial markets; Managers; Behavioral theory of the firms; Contextual factors; corporate downsizing; Financial community; Institutional investors; Investment analysts; Performance feedback; Performance targets; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052387171

Modeling firm size is important because retail chain dynamics are more richly driven by expansion and contraction than de novo entry or permanent exit. Additionally, anticipated size spillovers may influence the strategies of forward-looking firms, making it difficult to analyze the effects of size without explicitly accounting for these in the expectations and, hence, decisions of firms. Expansion may also be profitable for some firms while detrimental for others. Thus, we explicitly model and allow for heterogeneity in the dynamic link between firm size and profits as well as potential for persistent brand effects through firm-specific unobservable factors. As a methodological contribution, we surmount the hurdle of estimating the model by extending a two-step procedure that circumvents solving the game. The first stage combines semiparametric conditional choice probability estimation with a particle filter to eliminate the serially correlated unobservable components. The second stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate the payoff parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in 1970 to 2005 provide evidence of firm-specific heterogeneity in brand effects, size spillovers, and persistence in profitability. This heterogeneous dynamic linkage shows how McDonald's becomes dominant and other chains falter as they evolve, thus affecting market structure and industry concentration. © 2017 INFORMS.","Conditional choice probability estimation; Dynamic discrete choice; Firm expansion; Market dominance; Particle filter; Persistence in profits; Retail chains; Serial correlation; Size spillovers; Unobserved heterogeneity","Commerce; Monte Carlo methods; Profitability; Sales; Discrete choice; Particle filter; Probability estimation; Retail chains; Serial correlation; Size spillovers; Unobserved heterogeneity; Chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052658676

A previous study, which conducted a cross-sectional comparison in repetitive material-handling construction activities, suggested that a U-shaped relationship existed between physical strain and productivity at the group level. This research revisits those findings to further investigate the U-curve relationship between physical strain and productivity at the group level and validate the concept of diminishing marginal productivity. Heart rates were measured as an indicator of subjects' physical strain, whereas task productivity was estimated by work sampling. Eighty person-hour data were converted into panel data sets by dividing each subject's 4-h experimental data into 5-min intervals. These data sets were subsequently used to evaluate the effects of time on physical strain and productivity with 5-min lags. The study found a U-curve relationship between physical strain and task-level productivity at the group level while controlling for individual characteristics. The U-shape relationship was constant in the low-performance and high-performance groups, although the degrees of the polynomials differed.

Each type of capital represents a distinct factor of a firm’s production function. Drawing on a theory-of-production framework, we disaggregate overall IT capital into specific types to examine their unique effects on firm performance over time. We categorize these IT-specific production factors into a firm’s installed personal computers for individual information access, servers for collective information access, storage capacity for information stock, and nodes for information flow. We investigate when and how each IT capital type contributes to firm performance by analyzing the 5-year panel data of 1,548 US firms. Our findings show that individual information access capital and collective information access capital have immediate effects on profitability through cost efficiency or sales growth. By contrast, information stock capital has a lagged effect on profitability. In addition, information stock capital complements individual information access capital in improving profitability, as well as contributing to sales growth and cost efficiency equivalent to firm size. These results extend the existing research on firm-level effects of IT investments by demonstrating that different IT capital effects have unique ways of affecting firm performance. © 2017, © Operational Research Society 2017.","cost efficiency; Disaggregate IT capital effects; firm performance over time; panel data method; profitability improvement; sales growth; theory of production","Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Efficiency; Information retrieval; Investments; Personal computers; Profitability; Sales; Cost efficiency; Disaggregate IT capital effects; Firm Performance; Panel data; Sales growth; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028524122

These may produce one-off or periodic events that will inflict physical, economic and social implications, and direct, indirect and consequential losses. Using a case study approach, this paper combines various forms of data to examine the implications of future SLR to further understand the potential risks. The research indicates that the financial implications for local government will be loss of rates associated with total property loss and declines in value. The challenges identified are not specific to this research. Other municipalities worldwide experience similar barriers (i.e., financial implications, coastal planning predicaments, data paucity, knowledge and capacity, and legal and political challenges).

To date, research on social enterprise innovation has predominantly focused on micro-level factors, such as the social entrepreneur or organizational attributes. Inversely, recent empirical advances on social enterprise find a country’s social enterprise sector is influenced by macro-institutional factors, including form of government, stage of economic development, culture and model of civil society (Monroe-White and Coskun, in: Shaping social enterprise: understanding institutional context and influence, Emerald Publishing Limited, London, pp 27–48, 2017). Given the link between social enterprise and innovation, recent empirical findings around social enterprise beg the question, do macro-institutional factors similarly predict innovation by social enterprises? This paper uses a hierarchical linear model to examine the influence of national-level variables on social enterprise innovation. Results indicate that similar to social enterprise, macro-institutional factors predict social enterprise innovation. More specifically, macro-institutional factors influence the various types of innovations (product, process and marketing) differently. Moreover, country-level innovation is traditionally defined by economic factors, such as R&D funding and STEM workforce, however, these factors do not help explain social enterprise innovation. Given the social aspects of social enterprise innovation, to capture the full scope of innovation within countries, expanded definitions of national-level innovation should be considered. © 2018, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation; National Innovation Systems; Social enterprise","entrepreneur; innovation; numerical model; organization; regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045234959

We argue that a combination of vigilant monitoring, high-powered incentives, patient capital, and business independence makes private equity firms uniquely suited to correcting underinvestment problems in public corporations, and that they will therefore systematically target divested businesses that are outside their parents’ core area, whose rivals invest more in long-term strategic assets than their parents, and whose parents have weak managerial incentives both overall and at the divisional level. Results from a sample of 1,711 divestments confirm these predictions. Our study contributes to our understanding of private equity ownership, highlighting its advantage as an alternate governance form. Managerial Summary: Private equity firms are often portrayed as destroyers of corporate value, raiding established companies in pursuit of short-term gain. In contrast, we argue that private equity investors help to revitalize businesses by enabling investments in long-term strategic resources and capabilities that they are better able to evaluate, monitor, and support than public market investors. Consistent with these arguments, we find that when acquiring businesses divested by public corporations, private equity firms are more likely to buy units outside the parent's core area, those whose peers invest more in R&D than their parents, and those whose parents have weak managerial incentives, especially at the divisional level. Thus, private equity firms systematically target those businesses that may fail to realize their full potential under public ownership.

Yet, both the characterization of industry environments and evidence of how they evolve over time has been decidedly mixed. This reflects the limitations and overreliance on linear methods in management research. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear dynamical system methods from complexity theory as an alternative to characterize and operationalize industry environments. We identify three measures employed regularly in disciplines ranging from medicine to physics to identify nonlinear patterns in data. Using data from 19 key industry sectors over 36 years, we demonstrate how this method can be used to examine how industry environments evolve. Our results indicate that industry environments evolve as chaotic systems with unpredictability commensurate with characterizations of hypercompetition. Furthermore, we observe that this unpredictability is widespread across multiple industry sectors, and not relegated to a selected group of industry environments. However, we do observe variation in the level of complexity and sensitivity to initial conditions across industry sectors. Finally, we find no evidence that the level of unpredictability of these environments was increasing over the time period studied. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Chaos; dynamism; hypercompetition; industry environment","Biological systems; Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Computational complexity; Dynamical systems; Economics; Industrial management; Industry; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Sensitivity analysis; Biological system modeling; Complexity theory; dynamism; Hypercompetition; Industry environment; Technology managements; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041009945

Demand substitution exists between the two products (interproduct substitution) and may also exist across different time periods (intertemporal substitution). However, there is limited demand information such that the underlying probability distributions of the demand cannot be characterized precisely. We use an interval to represent, respectively, the demand for each individual product in each period, the aggregate demand for the two products in each period, and the total aggregate demand for the two products across multiple time periods. We propose a robust optimization model for this problem to maximize the worst-case total revenue. For the problem with interproduct demand substitution only, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm and show that the search spaces in the DP can be reduced greatly, which enables the algorithm to generate optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. For the problem with both interproduct and intertemporal demand substitutions, we develop a more complex dynamic programming algorithm and design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme that guarantees a proven, near optimal solution in a manageable computation time for practically sized problems. Our computational results show that, compared to a risk-neutral approach, our robust optimization approach can decrease the variance of the revenue at a small expense of the average revenue. We also generate a number of managerial insights: (i) none of the key structural properties commonly studied in the pricing literature hold for our problem; (ii) the revenue impact of ignoring intertemporal demand substitution when such substitution exists can be quite significant; and (iii) under- or overestimating the bounds of the demand intervals or imposing moderate business rules leads to relatively small revenue loss, typically. © 2017 INFORMS.","Business rules; Dynamic pricing; Fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS); Robust optimization; Substitutable products","Aggregates; Approximation algorithms; Costs; Economics; Optimal systems; Polynomial approximation; Probability distributions; Business rules; Dynamic pricing; Fully polynomial time approximation schemes; Robust optimization; Substitutable products; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047138764

Given the high social importance of civil infrastructure, considerable research attention has sought factors that lead to successful PPP. In a contribution to this body of work, and to the theory of the social sustainability of infrastructure, this paper presents statistical evidence showing that the choice of how to engage private investment in infrastructure is not culturally neutral. This analysis is built on a World Bank database of 1,792 railroad, seaport, airport, and toll road projects with private investment from 27 low- and middle-income nations and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Multinomial logistic regression shows that there are statistically significant relationships between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the various methods used to enable private investment in infrastructure projects. For all transport project types aggregated together, high power distance index scores predict the use of private funds in projects involving the construction of new infrastructure, while high individualism-collectivism and uncertainty avoidance scores predict the use of private funds in brownfield projects. Toll roads, which change a cultural norm regarding how most roads are accessed and paid for, emerged as a divergent technology type. Railroads are the technology type most strongly influenced by cultural dimensions. Engineers and policymakers may use these results to understand what forms of private investment in transportation infrastructure are more likely to be culturally acceptable in a wide variety of local contexts. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Sustainable construction","Construction industry; Economics; Railroads; Sustainable development; Toll highways; Transportation; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Individualism collectivisms; Infrastructure development; Infrastructure project; Multinomial logistic regression; Public private partnerships; Sustainable construction; Transportation infrastructures; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034576435

A local leader makes policies primarily to secure his political survival, which is contingent on the support from either his higher-level patrons or his local grassroots constituents. Using a simple model, we show that a local politician with close factional ties to high-level patrons will invest more in sending loyalty signals to the latter to receive their protections, while a poorly-connected politician will make more effort to spur a broad-based economic growth that economically benefits his local constituents. Using a unique county level data on the factional politics of Zhejiang Province, China, we find that counties with weaker (closer) factional ties have lower (higher) tax burdens per capita, while spending more (less) on local public goods provision.

We use a natural dominance relation, generalised Lorenz dominance, used in welfare comparisons in economic theory. In some settings there may be additional information about preferences (for example, if there is policy statement that one distribution is preferred to another) and any dominance relation should respect such preferences. However, characterising this sort of conditional dominance relation (specifically, dominance with respect to the set of all symmetric increasing quasiconcave functions in line with given preference information) turns out to be computationally challenging. This challenge comes about because, through the assumption of symmetry, any one preference statement (“I prefer giving $100 to Jane and $110 to John over giving $150 to Jane and $90 to John”) implies a large number of other preference statements (“I prefer giving $110 to Jane and $100 to John over giving $150 to Jane and $90 to John”; “I prefer giving $100 to Jane and $110 to John over giving $90 to Jane and $150 to John”). We present theoretical results that help deal with these challenges and present tractable linear programming formulations for testing whether dominance holds between any given pair of distributions.

We find that subjects systematically deviate from the theoretically optimal price and quantity levels. Contrary to expectation, decomposing the price and quantity decisions does not improve subjects' decisions. In a series of follow-up experiments, we isolate the effects of (a) interdependence between decisions and (b) demand uncertainty.We show that decisions improve by making subjects more aware of interdependence and by reducing the uncertainty. However, reducing complexity through partial automation of the interdependent dimensions does not improve the decisions made by subjects. We also find that subjects anchor on cost for price decisions and on mean demand potential for quantity decisions, thereby explaining the consistent underpricing and overordering behavior across experiments. © 2018 INFORMS.","Anchoring; Behavioral operations; Demand uncertainty; Multidimensional decision making; Pricing; Task interdependence","Behavioral research; Decision making; Anchoring; Behavioral operations; Demand uncertainty; Experimental investigations; Limited attentions; Partial automation; Production quantity; Task interdependence; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060715907

Though the economic impact of extreme weather is often measured and reported, the impact of systematic changes in weather, such as long-term temperature trends or short-term heat and cold waves are seldom quantified. In this research, we posit that such systematic changes in temperature impact the profitability of firms, and we develop a two-step econometric model to quantify the impact. The proposed two-step model estimates the impact that temperature has on the profitability of firms and partitions this impact into a long-term and a short-term component. We take up the case of six liquid refreshment beverages (LRBs) for illustrating the impact that systematic change in temperature has on demand. The results indicate that (a) the demand for LRBs is increasing by about 0.21% (63 million gallons) from year to year on account of the rising temperature trend, and (b) there is an asymmetry in the effect of a heat wave versus a cold wave on beverage demand (i.e., the weekly demand for beverages increases by about 2.1% per degree on account of a heat wave while the weekly demand decreases by only 0.4% per degree on account of a cold wave). We also illustrate how these estimates of the impact of the long-term temperature trends could be linked to strategic decisions, such as facility location, and the estimates of the impact of the short-term temperature aberrations could be linked to operational decisions such as the inventory order quantity in a week when there is a temperature aberration. © 2017","Beverage demand; Heat and cold waves; Reference-point effect; Temperature trends; Two-step estimation","Beverages; Climatology; Location; Profitability; Cold waves; Operational decisions; Reference point effects; Rising temperatures; Strategic decisions; Systematic changes; Temperature impact; Temperature trends; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032277446

This study examines how heterogeneity across divisions affects knowledge sourcing by multidivisional firms. We argue that firms source more early-stage knowledge, whose market prospects are highly uncertain, for low-performing divisions; by remaining active in the relevant markets, firms keep the flexibility to tap favorable market opportunities should they arise in the future. In contrast, firms source more late-stage knowledge, whose market prospects are largely revealed, for high-performing divisions so as to maximize current returns. The intra-firm heterogeneity, in turn, explains inter-firm differences in knowledge sourcing. Data from the pharmaceutical industry support these arguments. Managerial Summary: Firms that source external knowledge often span multiple technological areas and markets, and hence it is not immediately clear what to source and how much to source. This study examines how multidivisional firms tailor their knowledge-sourcing strategies to differences in performance across their divisions. We find that firms source more early-stage knowledge, whose market prospects are uncertain, for divisions with low innovation performance. This helps firms prop up those divisions and remain active in the related markets. In contrast, firms source more late-stage knowledge, whose market prospects are more certain, for divisions with high sales performance. This helps firms leverage the strengths of those divisions and realize immediate gains. Performance differences across divisions inside firms, therefore, can explain differences in knowledge-sourcing strategies across firms. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","corporate strategy; knowledge sourcing; market dynamics; multidivisional firms; specialized knowledge","Management; Planning; Corporate strategies; knowledge sourcing; Market dynamics; multidivisional firms; Specialized knowledge; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056398526

Both traditional and behavioural theories are used to investigate the decision-making process of residential consumers with empirical evidence based upon a specially designed quasi-experimental survey of 784 households on the decision to connect to a district-heating system, a more energy efficient alternative to individual heating systems. The results suggest an internal discount rate of around 36 per cent for homeowners, a signal that consumers undervalue future energy costs. We also find the household's decision to be negatively affected by years of payback up to around 7–8 years. Our findings suggest that neglecting consumer inattention and heuristics can lead to biases which cast doubt on the existence of the energy efficiency paradox. We believe that these results help to explain why some consumers are unlikely to invest in energy efficient technology, particularly those on low incomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Consumers; District heating; Energy efficiency; Heuristics; Inattention; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; District heating; Energy utilization; Heating equipment; Consumers; District heating system; Energy efficient technology; Heuristic decision makings; Heuristics; Inattention; Reduce energy consumption; Technology adoption; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050695359

Unfortunately, however, scholarly work in this area is strikingly limited. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to provide a first rigorous assessment of the role of morale in a sales context. Drawing on Job Demands-Resource (JD-R) as our theoretical lens and using a unique dataset that includes responses from three sources (i.e., sales managers, salespeople, and secondary objective data) from 81 companies over two time periods, our study makes several contributions. First, we offer a conceptualization of sales force morale and thus advance this timely and managerially relevant topic in a JD-R setting. Second, we show the negative impact of market demands (i.e., customer purchase complexity and market dynamism) on sales force morale. Third, the findings highlight the positive impact of morale on sales force turnover and productivity. Fourth, results show that two job resources attenuate the negative impact of market demands on sales force morale (i.e., sales capabilities training sales unit's cross-functional cooperation). Surprisingly, however, we find that a third job resource – that is, a firm's product portfolio depth – actually accentuates, rather than attenuates, the negative effects of market demands on sales force morale. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of our work and by elaborating on exciting avenues for future research in the area. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","JD-R theory; Morale; Productivity; Sales force; Turnover",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048558176

A new fast method is presented for computation of the probabilities for these distributions. This will enable practitioners in management science to exploit this rich class of models. We calculate the count probabilities by repeatedly convolving the discretized distribution, and then correct them using Richardson extrapolation. When just one probability is required, a second algorithm is described, an adaptation of De Pril's method, in which the computation time does not depend on the ordinality, so that even high-order probabilities can be rapidly found. Any survival distribution can be used to model the inter-arrival times, which gives models with great flexibility for modelling both underdispersed and overdispersed data. This work could pave the way for the routine use of these distributions as an additional tool for modelling event count data. An empirical example using fertility data illustrates the use of the method and has been fully implemented using an R package Countr developed by the authors and available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). © The authors 2017.","Convolution; Count data; Duration dependence; Hurdle model; Renewal process; Richardson extrapolation","Convolution; Economics; Extrapolation; Statistics; Computation time; Count datum; Discrete distribution; Duration dependence; Inter-arrival time; Renewal process; Richardson extrapolation; Survival distributions; Probability distributions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055447396

Therefore, technology intelligence activities should be directed to capture and deliver pertinent technological information. However, there is a distinct lack of tools for helping organizations to determine what constitutes useful/appropriate information for their needs. To address this issue, an ‘information needs’ template has been developed to support the process of eliciting and articulating meaningful search queries to guide those who will conduct and provide the necessary intelligence. The use of the template also acts as a means of priming the technology intelligence as it identifies and points to potentially useful sources of knowledge. It covers the spectrum of sources from leveraging internal information, through spanning organizational boundaries to access external sources across the specific industry and neighboring industries, to more distant fields of knowledge. Additionally, the template has sections for distinguishing ‘who to watch’ versus ‘who to talk to’. The deployment of the template can be integrated with roadmapping, using the roadmap landscape to feed hotspots/themes/gaps/white spaces into the template, which are then unpacked to determine the information needs of the organization. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Roadmapping; Strategic planning; Technology intelligence; Technology management","Strategic planning; Critical inputs; External sources; Hotspots; Organizational boundaries; Roadmapping; Search queries; Technology intelligence; Technology managements; Knowledge management; information technology; management; strategic approach; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048855735

Hospitality has also received much attention because it, among others, can produce and redistribute wealth whether in developed or developing economies, who often find it as an invaluable means of generating foreign income. Nonetheless, there is no combination of the three areas in a single study done in a developing economy. The paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of culture on the adoption of KM in the hospitality industry of Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: Hofstede’s culture model and technology acceptance model were used as underpinning theories to develop a research model which was operationalised into a 45-item questionnaire. A five-point Likert scale that ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree was used. The questions were closed-ended for the variables of the model, but there were also open-ended questions. Two Nigerian cities were purposely sampled and they generated 195 responses from the 400 questionnaires that were distributed. Correlation analysis was first done to establish relationships before regression analysis was performed after checking for multicollinearity. Findings and conclusions were drawn from significant hypotheses. Findings: The findings showed significant collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, femininity and short- and long-term orientations as factors that would affect adoption of KM in the hospitality industry of Nigeria. Power distance and individualism as factors, on the other hand, were not significant. Research limitations/implications: The research has produced a model that can form the basis for future research. The study apparently is the first and therefore needs replication in other industries and other developing economies. A comparative study can be done too between developing countries or between a developing and a developed country. Many replicated studies could perhaps produce a generic model that would apply beyond Nigeria. Moreover, as this study is on a moving target both in terms of culture and the extent of KM adoption, subsequent studies could update the findings of this study. Practical implications: Hospitality managers have to develop and maintain a conducive culture if adoption of KM is to be achieved. Managers should be sensitive to and take good advantage of cultural differences displayed in the personality traits of employees. For example, uncertainty avoidance (preference for precision) could be an asset to make knowledge explicit in computer systems, making it easier to share such knowledge in the organisation. Collectivism and nurturing orientation would encourage knowledge sharing and collaborative work, which is often nowadays done virtually. Managers should encourage knowledge workers to seek and acquire both short- and long-term views of their work. Originality/value: There apparently is no systematic empirical study that combines KM, hospitality and culture in developing economies’ context. Thus, this study examines the effects of culture on KM adoption in the Nigerian hospitality industry. The findings have practical implications on how the Nigerian hospitality industry can benefit from the application of KM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Developing economies; Hospitality; Knowledge management; Nigeria","Cell culture; Developing countries; Human resource management; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Managers; Regression analysis; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Developing economies; Hospitality; Long-term orientation; Nigeria; Open-ended questions; Technology acceptance model; Uncertainty avoidance; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054754919

Using data on the diffusion of global business services sourcing as a management practice from early experiments in the 1980s through 2011, we show that the extent to which governance choices are affected by process commoditization, availability of external service capabilities, and past governance choices depends on whether firms are early or late adopters. Findings inform research on governance choice dynamics specifically in highly diverse and evolving firm populations. Managerial Summary: This article considers how firms have chosen delivery models in global services sourcing decisions over time. Based on comprehensive data, we make two major observations. First, we find that firms that began with global services sourcing early, invested mainly in their internal sourcing capacity, while outsourcing only simple tasks to external providers, whereas firms that started later invested more in their capability to outsource various services to increasingly sophisticated suppliers. Second, we find that initial investments in internal or external sourcing capabilities have a strong effect on future choices of delivery models. This explains why, even today, firms vary greatly in how they implement global sourcing decisions, and it suggests that newcomers should learn from their own peer group rather than from highly experienced firms.

The problem area under investigation is a perceived lack of connectivity and alignment between and within public, for-profit, and the third sectors in Scotland. We argue that as the for-profit sector controls the majority of resources in most economies, they need to be part of any solution. However, we propose an approach that offers an alternative to the neoliberal business paradigm that has become prevalent in society and suggest that this must involve the inclusion of people and communities, in part represented by third sector organisations. We collected and analysed data from 145 participants and the outcome from this research was the ‘Connect model’ which was proposed to achieve the client's goal and to address a range of stakeholder challenges. In the SSM study, the ‘investing in social capital’ system was deemed a necessary early intervention, to bring together actors in an ‘open system’ that addresses the ‘whole problem’ area (launched as the ‘Responsible Business Forum’). Three additional concepts emerged from the study that helped refine the ‘Connect model’ and have implications for theory and practice: 1) the co-creation of business-community value, 2) facilitated by a conduit, 3) that unlocks a ‘shared space’ based on a match of shared aspirations and values. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Co-creation; Community operational research; Resource allocation; Responsible business practice; Soft systems methodology","Economics; Resource allocation; Business community; Business practices; Co-creation; Early intervention; Operational research; Soft systems methodology; Systems approach; Theory and practice; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038875181

However, the distribution of these significant social and economic benefits among the various stakeholders in the cloud ecosystem will critically depend on pricing and resource allocation decisions made by cloud providers. These decisions impact not only the provider revenue, but also the fairness of resources allocated among cloud users and the overall social welfare. Several unique features of cloud computing (e.g., the presence of multiple, nonfungible resources and heterogeneous users) make the interplay between these competing objectives hard to understand. To truly harness the power of cloud computing and to establish regulatory benchmarks, there is a need for frameworks that quantify how resource allocation and pricing choices affect different objectives. In this work, we introduce an analytical model that incorporates user utility, endogenous pricing, fairness among heterogeneous users, social welfare, and cloud provider revenue. We identify conditions under which there is a tradeoff between fairness and revenue, and quantify the extent of this tradeoff by formulating an optimization problem in which a cloud provider maximizes its revenue, subject to constraints on the desired level of fairness. Our work provides an initial step toward developing regulatory policies for cloud neutrality to ensure an equitable distribution of the transformative benefits of the cloud. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cloud computing; cloud neutrality; fairness; IT regulation; resource allocation; revenue distribution; social welfare","Cloud computing; Costs; Resource allocation; fairness; Heterogeneous users; Infrastructure costs; IT regulation; Optimization problems; Pricing and resource allocation; Revenue distributions; Social welfare; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055548062

Here, we demonstrate how time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) can be used to assess personnel costs and create process-improvement strategies. We used TDABC to evaluate the cost of providing pain control to patients undergoing thoracic surgery and to estimate the impact of specific process improvements on cost. Retrospective healthcare utilization data, with a focus on personnel costs, were used to assess cost across the entire cycle of acute pain medicine delivery for these patients. TDABC was used to identify possible improvements in personnel allocation, workflow changes, and epidural placement location and to model the cost savings of those improvements. We found that the cost of placing epidurals in the preoperative holding room was less than that of placing epidurals in the operating room. Personnel reallocation and workflow changes resulted in mean cost reductions of 14% with epidurals in the holding room and 7% cost reductions with epidurals in the operating room. Most cost savings were due to redeploying anesthesiologists to duties that are more appropriate and reducing their unnecessary duties by 30%. Furthermore, the change in epidural placement location alone in 80% of cases reduced costs by 18%. These changes did not compromise quality of care.

However, inference may be biased by the possibility that firms who share peers also share unobserved characteristics that are correlated with observed policy. Using a novel identification strategy, we predict and find that director connections through well-known island tax havens have a significant effect on corporate tax policy. Specifically, we find that U.S. firms with directors who are connected to firms domiciled on the islands of the Bahamas, Bermuda, or the Caymans exhibit significantly greater tax avoidance than other U.S. firms. The presence or arrival of an island director is associated with a reduction of between one and three percentage points in the firm's effective tax rate. We also observe a significant increase in the use of tax haven subsidiaries following the arrival of the island director. © 2017 INFORMS.","Director interlocks; Social networks; Tax aggressiveness; Tax avoidance; Tax havens","Management; Operations research; Social networking (online); Corporate policies; Director interlocks; Empirical literature; Identification strategies; Professional connections; Tax aggressiveness; Tax avoidance; Tax havens; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049399479

We find significant negative relationships between price and volume for new smartphones indicating that the profit potential of such markets for sellers is limited. We show, instead, that the price-volume relationships for remanufactured smartphones are positive and significant – suggesting that the secondary markets for such items are potentially highly profitable.

As such, the identification of pertinent turnaround strategies becomes increasingly important for senior management. Within the strategy-as-practice scholarly, there have been recent calls to move beyond empirical “isolationism” and to connect with other larger social phenomena; while across the turnaround literature there have been calls to explore the process and micro-structure of turnaround strategies in cyclical environments. To address this research gap, the purpose of the study is to adopt a tall ontology by blending the strategy-as-practice lens with the organizational decline and turnaround lens. By drawing on five exploratory case studies of large Irish construction contractors, the central objective is thus to explore firms’ turnaround strategizing practices during an environmental jolt. In order to advance our tall ontology, we developed a turnaround strategizing process model (and propositions) that integrates our findings, and which offers the fundamental building blocks of a new blended theory. We find that successful turnaround attempts entail the simultaneous interaction of non-aggressive cost retrenchment actions and non-extensive internationalization. The case studies further suggest that during a prolonged environmental jolt, cost retrenchment is more often a long-term strategy. Lastly, the findings provide valuable support for practitioners in developing a successful turnaround response, and in aiding the selection and timing of operational and strategic actions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Internationalization; Ireland; organizational turnaround; retrenchment; strategy-as-practice","Blending; Ontology; Internationalization; Ireland; organizational turnaround; retrenchment; Strategy as practices; Contractors; construction industry; globalization; management; organization; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028556540

The attractiveness of the after-sales business, however, has also been recognised by other parties (e.g. competitors, suppliers) who try to capture a share of the aftermarket. A highly profitable aftermarket creates a strong incentive for the supplier to disintermediate the established supply chain and sell directly to the OEM’s aftermarket customers. To counter this threat, OEMs must be aware of the activities and actors on their aftermarket, and should understand and systematically analyse the existing or changing business relationships among the incumbent and emergent actors in the aftermarket ecosystem. In this exploratory study we use case study research with 29 companies (customer, OEM, supplier, or competitor) and draw on social network theory–in particular the concepts of structural embeddedness, structural hole and supply chain disintermediation–to examine and discuss triadic and tetradic relationship constellations (archetypes) in aftermarkets. Recognising these relationship archetypes in aftermarkets can help firms to adapt their after-sales strategies and protect the competitive advantage, revenues and profits stemming from their after-sales business. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","after-sales management; aftermarket; archetypes; case study research; relationship constellations","Competition; Profitability; Supply chains; After-sales; aftermarket; archetypes; Case study research; relationship constellations; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030150808

We utilize a hierarchical clustering algorithm and several linear programming models to identify reference alternatives that are active to develop the sorting model, so that inactive ones are eliminated from the whole set of reference alternatives. Then, in order to construct a balanced set of assignment examples, a balancing algorithm is proposed to balance active reference alternatives across categories. Finally, the sorting model is obtained by minimizing the sum of violations between values of active reference alternatives and corresponding category thresholds. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approach is investigated on a hypothetical problem and several real data sets. The experimental results show that our approach is efficient to address the MCS problem with an imbalanced set of assignment examples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering analysis; Imbalanced set of assignment examples; Multiple criteria analysis; Multiple criteria sorting","Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Linear programming; Piecewise linear techniques; Additive value functions; Balancing algorithms; Clustering analysis; Hierarchical clustering algorithms; Imbalanced set of assignment examples; Linear programming models; Multiple criteria; Multiple criteria analysis; Sorting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026530425

However, managers find that making sound quality and pricing decisions under a complex multi-echelon in the current competitive electronic commerce environment is daunting and challenging. The purpose of this paper is to examine the optimum quality strategies under different cooperative mechanisms and investigate its effects on channel members’ profits. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a result of a China- UK collaborative research effort, involving researchers with expertise in information systems, quality management, supply chain management, pricing, and game theory models. The authors consider the quality decisions of a single product in a supply chain system that consists of a supplier and two competing manufacturers. The authors examine the optimum quality strategies under different cooperative mechanisms and investigate its effects on channel members’ profits. A modified Nerlove-Arrow model is employed to investigate the quality levels on goodwill and product sales. Findings – The results reveal that the traditional cooperative program is not very effective in the horizontal competitive market; and each channel member may have a profit improvement when the supplier integrates with a manufacturer. Originality/value – The authors believe that this paper will contribute to the existing body of knowledge. Moreover, the paper provides insights for managers to better manage their supply chain quality management in an information-centric context. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Differential games; Goodwill; Quality improvement; Supply chain management","Chains; Competition; Costs; Game theory; Information management; Managers; Manufacture; Profitability; Quality management; Sound reproduction; Collaborative research; Cooperative mechanisms; Design/methodology/approach; Differential games; Goodwill; Quality improvement; Supply chain quality management; Supply chain systems; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041109634

While concerns about the sustainability of China's growth model are rising, we assess to what extent rebalancing through a hard landing in China would impact other countries. After reviewing the main arguments pointing to a hard landing scenario—historical rebalancing precedents, overinvestment, unsustainable debt trends and real estate bubble—we use a global VAR methodology adapted to conditional forecasting to simulate the impact of a Chinese hard landing. We model metal and oil markets separately to account for their different end-use patterns and consumption intensity in China. According to our estimates, emerging economies would be hardest hit—with a 7.5% cumulated growth loss after 5 years—in particular in Emerging Asia and in commodity-exporting regions such as Latin America. The “growth gap” between emerging and advanced economies would be considerably reduced, leading to partial recoupling. In the light of these results, both the “commodity supercycle” and sustained convergence observed in emerging economies over the past decade could be to a large extent attributed to the high and unbalanced growth pattern in China. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","China; commodities; conditional forecast; global VAR; spillovers","commodity price; economic growth; economic impact; export; forecasting method; global economy; spillover effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043597298

Besides exploring the risk from commodity price, the research also examines the effects of a declining stochastic production costs, due to technology innovation in the long term. The extended real option model further examines how the time to build a gold mine can impact the optimized price threshold strategy. Sensitivity analysis and numerical evidence show that, (1) innovation in mining technology will boost the mine’s profitability and also shift the optimized price threshold; (2) mining operators can hedge a significant level of risk by treating time to build properly.

In the unconstrained problem, there is a unit cost associated with the sale of each product. The goal is to choose the prices for the products to maximize the expected profit obtained from each customer. We show that the optimal prices of the different products have a constant markup over their unit costs. We provide an explicit formula for the optimal markup in terms of the Lambert-W function. In the constrained problem, motivated by the applications with inventory considerations, the expected sales of the products are constrained to lie in a convex set. The goal is to choose the prices for the products to maximize the expected revenue obtained from each customer, while making sure that the constraints for the expected sales are satisfied. If we formulate the constrained problem by using the prices of the products as the decision variables, then we end up with a nonconvex program. We give an equivalent market-share-based formulation, where the purchase probabilities of the products are the decision variables. We show that the market-share-based formulation is a convex program, the gradient of its objective function can be computed efficiently, and we can recover the optimal prices for the products by using the optimal purchase probabilities from the market-share-based formulation.

(1) There are significant knowledge spillovers in both spatial and managerial networks. Having a peer which has imported from a particular country more than doubles the probability of starting to import from that country, but the effect quickly decays with distance. (2) Spillovers are heterogeneous: they are stronger when firms or peers are larger or more productive, and exhibit complementarities in firm and peer productivity.

However, not all resource-rich countries experience widespread corruption. To help explain this puzzle, I propose that the relationship between natural resources (e.g. the depletion of minerals) and corruption is dependent on the composition of the selectorate (through diverse levels of economic development) and the variation of political systems (democracies vs. autocracies). The large-N empirical analysis finds support for the hypotheses: on average, poor, autocratic, resource-rich countries suffer from more corruption than rich, democratic, resource-rich countries. This research contributes to the discussion of resource curses and blessings by suggesting that a closer inspection of a country's political and economic conditions is required to understand the causal link between natural resource wealth and corruption. Whereas the empirical analysis particularly focuses on the validity of the argument for mineral resource wealth and corruption, the overall theoretical and empirical scope of this paper is intentionally broader in nature: The paper also contributes to our collective research understanding of various forms of resource wealth (i.e. mineral depletion, fuel exports, oil wealth or energy depletion) and corruption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Corruption; Democratic institutions; Economic development; Middle class; Mineral depletion; Natural resources; Selectorate","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Mineral resources; Minerals; Natural resources; Corruption; Economic condition; Economic development; Empirical analysis; Energy depletion; Middle class; Political systems; Selectorate; Crime; class; commodity; corruption; economic development; mineral; natural resource; organization; political system; resource depletion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048484314

By offshoring production, MNCs have generally enjoyed lower labor costs and higher production efficiencies, in addition to other benefits. Unfortunately, target countries chosen for such activities tend to be pollution friendly countries. To make matter worse, strong environmental pollution regulations in host countries (for example, through carbon taxes, focus on the triple bottom line, incentives to select green technology investment options) have incentivized MNCs to offshore more activities. In this study, an optimization model is presented where a domestic firms' propensity to offshore is shown to be function of the market structure in the industry. The findings suggest that a domestic firms' propensity to offshore pollution via production in pollution friendly host countries is directly related to the degree of competition in the industry. In this context, the paper presents specific scenarios where governments could effectively force firms operating in less competitive industry environments to pay an “offshoring penalty”. These proceeds could then be used to subsidize firms in competitive industries who could then be incentivized to adopt green technology instead of offshoring production and pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Market structure; Offshoring; Pollution regulation; Triple bottom line","Commerce; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Investments; Pollution; Wages; Environmental pollutions; Market structures; Multi-national corporations; Off-shoring; Optimization modeling; Pollution regulation; Production efficiency; Triple Bottom Line; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049331977

Findings: The empirical findings reveal that carbon abatement may positively or negatively affect environmental productivity growth which is dependent on the nature of technology in a sector, the innovation capabilities of a country and environmental regulations. Originality/value: Conventional approaches in measuring productivity changes do not normally take undesired outputs (e.g. carbon emissions) into consideration. This study contributes to literature by constructing a PAI that considers productivity changes under a joint production technology (where both desired and undesired outputs are considered).

The imitator's dilemma tells a story of why firms should break out of imitation-oriented R&D and move toward innovation-oriented R&D in order to sustain their innovation output and profit performance. This article contributes to the technology and innovation management literature by illuminating the imitator's dilemma both theoretically and empirically. To this end, this study develops and tests hypotheses to investigate the influence of a firm's imitation activity on its innovation output and profit performance, which represent a gap in the current literature. A longitudinal research design is followed on an unbalanced panel dataset between 1991 and 2010 from a sample of 227 firms in three R&D-intensive manufacturing industries in the United States, including computer, semiconductor, and pharmaceutical. The results of this research reveal a dilemma for imitators. Imitation activity can generate positive returns in terms of a firm's innovation output and return on assets ROA (a measure of short-term profits). However, these returns are unsustainable. Excessive levels of imitation activity within the firm results in negative returns in terms of its innovation output and ROA. Additionally, any level of imitation activity, low or high, negatively impacts a firm's Tobin's Q (a measure of long-term corporate valuation). Accordingly, this article makes novel contributions to the technology and innovation management literature by explaining the imitator's dilemma and how firms may effectively manage it. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",,"Industrial research; Profitability; Corporate valuation; Longitudinal research; Manufacturing industries; Return on assets; Short term; Technology development; Engineering research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048032262

Research output potential is a key criterion in most academic appointments. Generally, there is a long lead time between the conduct of research and its ultimate value in the form of disseminated knowledge. This means higher education institutions usually reward financially staff on the prospect of research output, albeit on the basis of research outputs achieved up to the point of recruitment or discretionary salary rise (e.g. through promotion). We propose a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model which can be used retrospectively to set salary costs against corresponding research outputs achieved as a measure of the financial efficacy of past recruitment and promotion practices. The analysis can identify potential issues with those practices and lead to improvements for the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Academic promotions; Academic recruitment; Cost efficiency; Data Envelopment Analysis","Compensation (personnel); Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Education; Efficiency; Employment; Wages; Academic promotions; Academic recruitment; Academic staff; Cost efficiency; Economic efficiency; Higher education institutions; Long leads; Research outputs; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024119539

Additionally, a unidirectional causality from economic growth to tourism and a mutually reinforcing effect between capital investment and tourism are noted. Thus, greater impact of tourism on the economic growth can be realized through tourism-related investment activities such as improvements in airports, roads, transportation, telecommunications, financial sector, technology, and natural parks and beaches. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.","Autoregressive distributed lag model; Causality; Economic growth; Fiji; International visitor arrivals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053249926

Moreover, hospital executives in more competitive hospital markets are faced with several competing priorities. Our study seeks to examine two factors within this context: (1) how competition directly impacts PoC, and (2) in a financially constrained environment, how competition affects investments in resources such as nurses and technology that can potentially improve PoC. We collect longitudinal data from all acute care hospitals in California over a 7-year period from 2007 to 2013, along with data from several other sources. Analysis using a mixed-methods approach reveals that both PoC and investments in nurses and technology are lower in more competitive markets. Because future reimbursements under the pay-for-performance system will depend on the value of care provided, our results suggest that hospitals should reconsider their short-term actions that seek to increase market share and instead adopt a long-term view in which investments are made to fundamentally improve the underlying processes and PoC. The findings presented here thus have major implications for managing hospitals in competitive environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Health information technologies; Hospitals; Investments; Process of care; Registered nurses","Commerce; Competition; Hospitals; Nursing; Competitive environment; Competitive markets; Health information technologies; Hospital market; Longitudinal data; Market share; Mixed method; Performance system; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040682228

However, it is unclear whether social ties facilitate or inhibit firms’ decision-making on dominant design generation. Our study distinguishes the variant roles of business ties and political ties and examines how contextual factors moderate the effects of these ties. Based on archival data of 443 Chinese automotive firms embedded in standard alliances during the period 2005–2009, we find that weak business ties enhance firms’ influence on dominant design, and the positive effect of the number of business ties is even stronger when firms operate in a context with higher IRP enforcement. Moreover, the empirical results indicate that when either the IPR enforcement or the technological turbulence is high, establishing political ties is detrimental to a firm's influence on dominant design. Our findings add new insights to the research on social capital, dominant design, and open innovation in the automotive industry. The findings also provide significant implications for managers by showing how they can utilize social ties to influence the emergence of dominant designs in an industry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alliance networks; Dominant design; Social ties; Standard alliance","Decision making; Turbulence; Alliance networks; Archival data; Contextual factors; Dominant design; Open innovation; Social capitals; Social ties; Technological turbulences; Automotive industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040372713

Therefore, science communication is of paramount importance for issues that closely relate to the public, such as sustainability, climate change, and environmental behaviors.

This article considers scientist engagement as a two-stage process consisting of participation and effort and then explores the causal effects of social factors in this process. Based on a field experiment with Chinese scientists, we find that, as social proof, information of peers’ engagement significantly increases scientists’ participation, but not their real efforts made in science communication; in-group meaning, which emphasizes the benefits of scientist communication to the science community, does not induce more participation but significantly increases average efforts of participants. A combination of social proof and in-group meaning can lead to greatest efforts of scientists to communicate with the general public. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental behavior; Field experiment; Meaning; Public engagement; Social proof","Climate change; Decision making; Sustainable development; Environmental behavior; Field experiment; Meaning; Public engagement; Social proof; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031916292

Rooted in the literature on demand and supply integration, we develop the relationship between delivery variety decisions and sales through the mediating role of unit fill rate. We find that a decision to increase delivery variety will indirectly improve sales through the mediating role of the fill rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that decisions on order variety (the number of ordering methods offered to buyers) moderates this mediation effect. A decision to increase order variety enhances the benefits of delivery variety. We estimate our models using archival data including deliveries, order fulfillment, sales records, and other operational data over three years. When the number of delivery methods increases from 1 to 3, fill rates increase by 1.22% and sales increase by 15.39%, and when the number of order methods increases from 1 to 4, the impact of delivery variety on fill rates increases by an additional 0.39% and on sales by an additional 4.68%. These findings provide empirical support for the integration of demand and supply associated with decision making in supply chains and underscore the need for top management to consider the complementary benefits of delivery variety and order variety on order fulfillment and sales. © 2017 Decision Sciences Institute","Delivery Variety; Logistics Flexibility; Longitudinal Study; Moderated Mediation; Sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038850059

However, negative consumer responses to both smart meters and new pricing systems indicate that building public acceptance of these transitions is critically important. Deliberative Pollings (DPs) offer the potential to effectively integrate public perceptions into energy transition decision-making. Most deliberative governance studies focus on western countries and very few examine the Asian context. This paper presents an exploratory study of undergraduate students’ perceptions of dynamic pricing options in two pilot DPs conducted in the cities of Guangzhou and Kyoto. The study indicates that deliberative processes yield mixed outcomes in changing participants’ choice of pricing options. While many welcomed new pricing options, a significant number supported status quo options. Second, the normative mechanisms and outcomes of deliberative participation seem to apply in the Asian context. DP appears to enhance participants’ acceptance of complex and sophisticated pricing options. Dialogic processes enhanced the participants’ ability to understand complex issues and weigh up trade-offs when comparing options. Third, national level contextual differences associated with public distrust and familiarity with market logic may explain the differences in responses between Chinese and Japanese participants. We argue that complex and controversial energy decision-making needs to be supported by deliberative participatory processes to enable citizens to make informed and considered choices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Deliberative participation; Dynamic pricing; Public perception; Smart grids; Undergraduate students","Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Asia; Deliberative participation; Dynamic pricing; Public perception; Smart grid; Undergraduate students; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053078834

Nevertheless, their contribution to broadband development has varied significantly over time. In the late 1990s, both local and national utilities in the European Union (EU) engaged in the provision of broadband networks, but only few of them managed to establish themselves as major broadband providers. More recently, new projects involving national utilities have been announced in several EU countries, opening new scenarios for utilities’ contribution to Next Generation Access (NGA) development. This paper identifies and explores the factors affecting the entry and the success of utilities in the EU broadband market, through the comparison of four case studies from four EU countries (Germany, Italy, Sweden and the UK). The evolution of utility involvement in the EU broadband markets is assessed against the interaction of market, technology and policy factors, focusing on the impact of policy and regulatory measures. As a result, this paper provides fruitful insights into the relevance and effectiveness of public interventions in broadband markets.

We examine one possible resolution to this puzzle by observing that, although the incentive to work harder under profit sharing is weak, it might be sufficient to motivate workers to report each other for shirking, especially if the workers are reciprocally minded. Our model provides the rationale for this conjecture, and we discuss the results of an experiment finding that workers who share in firm profits are more willing to provide accurate information about their peers to management and that profit sharing is most effective when peer reporting is possible. © 2017 INFORMS.","Experiment; Peer reporting; Profit sharing; Reciprocity; Team production","Experiments; Human resource management; Wages; Empirical literature; Firm Performance; Peer reporting; Positive impacts; Profit sharing; Reciprocity; Work team; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052622968

To model this, we consider a spatial equilibrium model of price formation, where constraints on inter-regional flows result in three distinct equilibria in prices. We use this to motivate an econometric model for the distribution of observed electricity spot prices that captures many of their unique empirical characteristics. The econometric model features supply and inter-regional trade cost functions, which are estimated using Bayesian monotonic regression smoothing methodology. A copula multivariate time series model is employed to capture additional dependence — both cross-sectional and serial — in regional prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed model compares favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian monotonic function estimation; Copula time series model; Intraday electricity prices","Commerce; Cost functions; Electric power system interconnection; Power markets; Time series; Australian national electricity markets; Electricity prices; Empirical characteristics; Monotonic functions; Multivariate time series models; Spatial equilibrium models; Time series modeling; Wholesale electricity markets; Costs; Bayesian analysis; econometrics; electricity supply; energy market; estimation method; numerical model; price dynamics; time series analysis; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051514012

Design/methodology/approach: The study used personal construct psychology and repertory grids as the foundation for the study in a mixed-methods design. Data collection consisted of 11 in-depth interviews followed by a survey with 115 employee responses. The data from the interviews informed the design of the survey. Findings: The results of the interviews identified a number of themes around individual responsibility for information security and the ability of individuals to contribute to information security. The survey demonstrated that those employees who thought the that organisation was driven by the need to protect information also thought that the risks were overstated and that their colleagues were overly cautious. Conversely, employees who thought that the organisation was driven by the need to optimise its use of information felt that the security risks were justified and that colleagues took too many risks. Research limitations/implications: The survey findings were not statistically significant, but by breaking the survey results down further across business areas, it was possible to see differences within groups of individuals within the organisation. Originality/value: The literature review highlights the issue of social acceptability bias and the problem of uncovering weakly held attitudes. In this study, the use of repertory grids offers a way of addressing these issues. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; Information security; Personal construct psychology; Social acceptability bias","Information use; Personnel; Security of data; Surveys; Attitudes; Design/methodology/approach; Employee attitudes; In-depth interviews; Literature reviews; Personal construct psychology; Protect information; Social acceptability; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051292165

Based on proxies, the parameter estimation of GARCH model is derived through the composite quantile regression. The consistency and the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are obtained under mild conditions on the innovation processes. To examine the finite sample performance of our newly proposed method, simulation studies are conducted with comparison to several existing estimators of the GARCH model.

Changes in regulation and intermediation technologies have affected the efficiency with which these firms can perform these services. Relatively small community banks, those with assets of $1 billion or less, have experienced particular changes in their ability to generate loan products as efficiently as their larger counterparts. Using FFIEC data for all banks of $10 billion or less, we measure the x-efficiency of all community banks and compare the results of small and all other community banks since 2010. We test for the importance of internal and external determinants of efficiency. We observe that declines in product provision are related to specific determinants of declining x-efficiency in small community banks. The results indicate limited assets or customer growth rates experienced by small community banks, coupled with a declining population in community bank trade areas, do not support improvements in x-efficiency through expanded intermediation activity. Small asset community bank managers will need to strategically deploy products that allow the customer relationship to be enhanced and sustained, using customer affiliations that cannot be easily adopted by larger competitors. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Community banks; Lending; Management; X-efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028559932

First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote di erent types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption influenced engagement, albeit in di erent ways. Firm-to-customer communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had varying e ects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms o ering digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact with each other postadoption.

As such, it is a potentially significant determinant of demand for goods and services, including air travel. Drawing on data from the U.S. domestic airline industry and newly available measures of socio-economic mobility, we empirically discern how the latter affects both yields and passenger counts at U.S. airports. The results offer compelling evidence that greater mobility is associated with lower air fares. In addition, our findings suggest that greater passenger volumes are also lower in areas marked by higher socio-economic mobility, all else equal.

The results show that corporate volunteering programmes which partner construction industry professionals with school students in a work-related activity-based learning environment can have a significant impact on student construction industry knowledge, perceptions, career choices, aspirations and employability skills. This is particularly the case for female students and for students whose learning styles do not align with traditional classroom-based pedagogies.

In addition, relief providers such as the nongovernmental organizations and charities raise funds, and procure and deliver supplies (food, water, and medicines) for humanitarian relief. The strategy for managing disasters must, therefore, weigh the costs and benefits of building levees as well as procuring and delivering supplies. We use a three-stage decision making framework to study how the investment in levee capacity can be integrated with supply procurements, fundraising, and rapid response. One of our major findings is that a large fundraising cost discourages postdisaster funding, implying relatively large investments in levee and prepositioned supplies. That notwithstanding, a large social value (of saving life) can tilt the balance in favor of postdisaster funding. If the levee capacity increases, funding for predisaster procurement is reduced without affecting postdisaster funding. For a sufficiently large increase in capacity, however, postdisaster response becomes superfluous. We also find that hurricane uncertainty motivates levees with large capacity. In contrast, levee-failures motivate levees with small capacity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","fundraising; hurricane disaster; levee capacity; levee failures; postdisaster response; risk mitigation; supply prepositioning","Costs; Decision making; Disasters; Embankments; Hurricanes; Levees; Costs and benefits; Decision-making frameworks; fundraising; Humanitarian relief; Nongovernmental organizations; Post-disaster response; Pre-positioning; Risk mitigation; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052452264

It is only after an individual has become readied, and at a later time, does the individual make event decisions in the perpetration of a specific crime. Consequently, extant ICA research has overlooked consideration of why-prior to the crime-an individual initially considers engaging in such criminal activity in the first instance. Notably, this consideration should not to be conflated with intentions. We argue that there needs to be a clear distinction between those motivational factors that would lead to the consideration of such engagement at the initial involvement stage, and those factors that would lead an individual at the event stage to perpetrate a crime. We thus propose a revised version of the extended security action cycle (ESAC), which reflects these criminal decision-making stages. Moreover, we provide a means through which to identify and understand the relationship among those factors that may motivate an individual during the initial involvement stage by drawing on the life course perspective (LCP). With a focus on time, context, and process, the LCP offers a framework in which four key principles are inscribed. Through examples drawn from the LCP and white-collar crime literature, we illustrate how these principles can provide a basis for conceptualizing factors that motivate ICA and open up new avenues for future research/theory development. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

This paper investigates how hospitals’ conformance quality (CQ) and experiential quality (EQ), in terms of their combined magnitude (i.e. their interaction) and relative balance (i.e. the absolute difference between them) impact hospital productivity. First, we explore the impact of both the ‘combined dimension of quality’ and ‘balance dimension of quality’ on hospital productivity. Second, we investigate quality dominance to analyze its impact on productivity when CQ is greater than EQ, and vice versa. Secondary data (January 2015 to December 2015) were collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and American Hospital Directory (AHD) for US acute care hospitals. The results provide strong empirical support for the benefit of minimizing the gap between the two types of quality. In addition, the results suggest that considering quality dominance (experiential vs. conformance) might be useful in shedding light on the inherent tension that exists when firms are forced to allocate resources to provide different types of quality simultaneously. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","healthcare; Hospital quality; productivity; service design","health care; hospital sector; productivity; resource allocation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032020334

One example is the European energy sector, where benchmarking is based on actual cost data, which are influenced by managerial inefficiency as well as operational heterogeneity. This paper demonstrates how a conditional nonparametric method, which allows comparison of firms operating under heterogeneous technologies, can be used to estimate managerial inefficiency. A dataset of 123 distribution firms in Norway is used to show aggregate and firm-specific effects of conditioning. We compare the models presently used by the Norwegian regulator to a suggested conditional model, thus providing a viable alternative to distinguish between managerial inefficiency and operational heterogeneity. The use of the conditional model in this regulatory context leads, first, to a decrease in aggregate efficient costs and, second, to a reallocation effect that affects the relative profitability of firms and relative customer prices, thus providing a fairer basis for setting revenue caps. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Electricity distribution; Yardstick regulation","Aggregates; Benchmarking; Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Electric utilities; Conditional models; Electricity distribution; Electricity networks; Heterogeneous environments; Heterogeneous technology; Natural monopolies; Nonparametric methods; Yardstick regulations; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028313478

We use the heterogeneity in buyer search cost to rationalize why a firm offers periodic price discounts and enjoys a high profit in such a market. An estimation method is proposed to recover the nonparametric distribution of buyer search cost from the price and transaction volume data. With both data, we show that the search cost distribution can be estimated nonparametrically in a sequential search model, and estimation results from a nonsequential search model are robust to the assumption on the maximum number of searches. We also show that the commonly observed high-low pricing strategy can be an optimal strategy for firms when buyers search for price information sequentially. As an empirical application, we use the proposed method to estimate the two search models using data on a commodity product sold by a firm in a business-to-business market. The models predict a high profit margin for the firm, which is consistent with the data, but the sequential search model fits with the observed price distributions and supply costs better than the nonsequential search model. © 2017 INFORMS..","Mixed pricing strategy; Nonparametric empirical likelihood method; Price competition; Price variation; Search cost","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Maximum likelihood estimation; Profitability; Sales; Empirical likelihood; Price competition; Price variation; Pricing strategy; Search costs; Cost estimating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042856502

This potentially induces passengers to book the ticket well in advance in order to obtain a lower fare ticket, and later adjust their ticket when they are sure about trip scheduling. This is especially true in flexible refund markets where ticket cancellation and exchange behavior has been recognized as having major impacts on revenues. In this paper, we propose an inter-temporal choice model of ticket cancellation and exchange for railway passengers where customers are assumed to be forward looking agents. A dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) is applied to predict the timing in which ticket exchange or cancellation occurs in response to fare and trip schedule uncertainty. The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping problem, and a two steps look-ahead policy is adopted to approximate the dynamic programming problem. The approach is applied to real ticket reservation data for intercity railway trips. Estimations results indicate that the DDCM provides more intuitive results when compared to multinomial logit (MNL) models. In addition, validation results show that DDCM has better prediction capability than MNL. The approach developed here in the context of exchange and refund policies for railway revenue management can be extended and applied to other industries that operate under flexible refund policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"decision making; discrete choice analysis; electronic commerce; logit analysis; management; model validation; railway transport; transportation economics; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040615698

While previous studies use models relying on area-specific unemployment rates to estimate this average effect, this paper employs a model based on area-specific unemployment rates by gender and age group. The rationale for breaking down unemployment rates is that the severity of cyclical upturns and downturns does not only significantly vary across geographical areas, but also across gender and age. The empirical analysis uses microdata from the Italian Multipurpose Household Survey on Everyday Life Issues. The estimates suggest that models employing aggregated and disaggregated unemployment rate measures as a proxy for the business cycle produce similar findings for some health behaviours (such as smoking), whereas different results are obtained for others. While using unemployment rates by gender and age group, fruits and/or vegetables consumption turns out to be procyclical (a 1pp increase in this unemployment rate decreases the probability of consuming at least five daily fruit and/or vegetable servings by 0.0016pp), the opposite effect, though statistically insignificant, is observed once general unemployment rates are used. While both models conclude that physical activity declines during economic downturns, the size of the procyclical effect is much smaller when employing disaggregated rather than aggregated unemployment rates (a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate by gender and age group decreases the probability of doing any physical activity by 0.0017pp). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Business cycle; Health behaviours; Italy; Unemployment","adult; female; fruit; gender; health behavior; household; human; Italy; male; physical activity; probability; smoking; unemployment; vegetable; adolescent; age; drinking behavior; economics; epidemiology; exercise; Italy; middle aged; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Alcohol Drinking; Economics; Exercise; Female; Fruit; Health Behavior; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Smoking; Vegetables; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034453182

Corporate governance mitigates investment distortions so that firms with strong governance have more valuable investment options during booms and more valuable divestiture options during busts than the ones with weak governance. Because investment options are riskier and divestiture options are less risky than assets in place, the expected returns of strongly governed firms are higher during booms but lower during busts than the weakly governed ones.

Obtaining such an understanding is important because, as per signaling theory, investors' preferences for sustainable development initiatives and disclosures are one of the contributory factors in determining the quality of environmental disclosures. A web-based survey of a group of investors was conducted. The questionnaire includes a hypothetical case-based scenario presenting environmental versus economic consequences of pollution prevention initiatives for a small mining company. The findings indicate that a majority (52%) of the respondents failed to choose a dominant proenvironmental or profinancial strategy. The findings imply that making a decision about a sustainable initiative is complex and requires consideration of a range of contextual factors. The findings support the view that given the resource limitations of a small company, compliance with existing regulation is preferred by the investors over competitive advantage and reputation for undertaking prosustainability initiatives. Hence, one implication is that the regulators should examine tightening the current sustainability regulation status for small companies regarding their environmental policies and disclosures.

It describes impediments to the process of adaptation that could in principle be overcome but often are not. Many adaptation constraints have been identified and described in the literature across a wide range of contexts, and the importance of their influence on climate change adaptation is clear. However most studies have focussed on describing constraints rather than exploring their origins, processes, and possible impacts. As a consequence, it has been difficult to operationalise the concept to provide information meaningful to decision makers. This study demonstrates an approach to estimating empirically the processes and the impacts of adaptation constraints, based on a case-study of farmers in New Zealand. It combines established social scientific methods to explore the processes underlying a range of adaptation constraints and estimate the impacts that these constraints may have. The approach can be used to explore further the social and economic impacts of adaptation constraints. This information can then be used to consider sub-optimal adaptation to climate change more fully, and paves the way for policy responses that are more conscious of the human elements of climate change adaptation. © 2018","Adaptation barriers; Adaptation behaviour; Adaptation constraints; Adaptation deficit; Adaptive capacity; Climate change","Behavioral research; Decision making; Adaptation barriers; Adaptation behaviour; Adaptation constraints; Adaptation deficit; Adaptive capacity; Climate change; adaptation; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; economic impact; exploration; literature review; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052865067

It is known that defects tend to be clustered and a chip is likely to be defective if its neighbors are defective. This neighborhood effect is not well captured in traditional yield modeling approaches. We propose a new yield prediction model, called adjacency-clustering which addresses, for the first time, the neighborhood effect, and delivers prediction results that are significantly better than state-of-the-art methods. Adjacency-clustering (AC) model is a form of the Markov random field minimum energy model (MRF) that is primarily known in the context of image segmentation. AC model is a novel use of MRF for identifying defect patterns that enable diagnosis of failure causes in the manufacturing process. In this paper we utilize the defect patterns obtained by the AC model for yield prediction. We compare the performance of the AC model to that of leading yield prediction models including the Poisson, the negative binomial, the Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression models, on real data sets and on simulated data sets. The results demonstrate that the adjacency-clustering model captures the neighborhood effect and delivers superior prediction accuracy. Moreover, the concept and methodology of adjacency-clustering are not limited to integrated circuit manufacturing. Rather, it is applicable in any context where a neighborhood effect is present, such as disease risk mapping and energy consumption prediction. © 2018 INFORMS.","Adjacency-clustering; Markov random field; Semiconductor; Yield prediction","Defects; Diagnosis; Energy utilization; Image segmentation; Integrated circuits; Magnetorheological fluids; Manufacture; Markov processes; Regression analysis; Semiconductor materials; Timing circuits; Adjacency-clustering; Energy consumption prediction; Integrated circuit manufacturing; Markov Random Fields; Negative binomial regression model; State-of-the-art methods; Yield prediction; Yield prediction models; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061593883

Hence, we extend the finite sample variance correction methodology of Windmeijer (2005) to the OGMME for the SARAR(1, 1) model. Results from simulation studies indicate that the correction method improves the variance estimates in small samples and leads to more accurate inference for the spatial autoregressive parameters. For the same model, we compare the finite sample properties of various test statistics for linear restrictions on autoregressive parameters. These tests include the standard asymptotic Wald test based on various GMMEs, a bootstrapped version of the Wald test, two versions of the C(α) test, the standard Lagrange multiplier (LM) test, the minimum chi-square test (MC), and two versions of the generalized method of moments (GMM) criterion test.

These data characteristics limit the applicability of existing techniques in marketing and machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model-based embedding technique, which takes the customer observations and a probabilistic model class generating the observations as inputs, and outputs an embedding—a low-dimensional vector representation in Euclidean space—for each customer. We then cluster the embeddings to obtain the segments. Theoretically, we derive precise necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee asymptotic recovery of the true segments under a standard latent class setup. Empirically, we demonstrate the speed and performance of our method in two real-world case studies: (a) up to 84% improvement in accuracy of new movie recommendations on the MovieLens data set and (b) up to 8% improvement in the performance of similar product recommendations algorithm on an offline data set at eBay.

We resort to a shift-share instrument and precise location-specific fixed effects to estimate the causal impact of spending. Cities that receive more contract expenditure witness an expansion in output – with contracts generating $1.4 per dollar spent – but experience only modest increases in employment. The impact is also constrained geographically and short-lived.

For the mining sector, each physical asset may have a significant financial exposure to extreme climate events such as floods and droughts. Often, these financial risks are difficult to value given the paucity of data on climate extremes, and limited company assessment and disclosure of the associated financial liability. We propose a generalization of the Brennan-Schwartz approach to real option valuation to address this situation. A Poisson point process is used to model arrivals of extreme events that exceed the estimated design return period of the flood/drought mitigation infrastructure at the site. Using techniques from the field of robust performance analysis, we are able to calculate upper and lower bounds over all the probability models within a certain distance from the original model, that address the potential uncertainty of the risk and loss. We suggest two different approaches for mine valuation based on this technique. The first, and more direct approach, calibrates the distance of probability measures from a set of known mine transactions and prices a mine (with currently unknown value) relative to the training set of mines. The second approach uses historical precipitation data from a mine site, to calculate a “worst case” disaster arrival process from the actual physical data, and then the mine is priced using this process. Generalizations to a portfolio of assets are also considered. © 2018",,"Finance; Floods; Resource valuation; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Poisson point process; Precipitation data; Probability measures; Real option valuations; Real options valuations; Robust performance analysis; Sovereign wealth funds; Upper and lower bounds; Climate models; climate effect; extreme event; mining; numerical model; performance assessment; return period; valuation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042631901

Research on the management of technology-oriented licenses has nonetheless pointed out the risks of corrosive disputes caused by conflicting interests or misunderstandings among licensing partners. The choice made ex ante on mechanisms for resolving potential disputes is of prime importance in the execution of licensing exchanges. Although the legal literature has widely emphasized the advantages of arbitration towards litigation, public ordering remains the “default” option in managers’ eyes. By adopting a transaction cost economics logic, our study explores the conditions under which licensing partners may prefer arbitration over public ordering during the contractual-design phase. In accordance with our theoretical arguments, findings show that the occurrence of arbitration provisions increases when the coordination orientation adopted by licensing partners is extensive. In situations where both monitoring and coordination orientations are simultaneously extensive, results reveal a greater propensity to prefer arbitration over public ordering. Our research therefore supports the view that corporate decision-makers tend to favor the conciliatory stance and compromising awards typically associated with arbitration, only when exchanges are expected to be highly coordinative. Their preference for arbitration over litigation is magnified when the coordination orientation develops alongside the monitoring orientation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Arbitration; Contract design; Dispute; Technology licensing","Decision making; Economics; Arbitration; Contract design; Dispute; Dispute resolution mechanisms; Management of technology; Technology licensing; Theoretical arguments; Transaction cost economics; Laws and legislation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045200161

The approach takes a snapshot from a live game, identifies historical games that have the same snapshot, and uses the outcomes of these games to calculate the winning probabilities of the teams in this game as the game is underway. Using data obtained from 20 seasons worth of NBA games, we build three models and compare their accuracies to a baseline accuracy. In Model 1, each snapshot includes the point difference between the home and away teams at a given second of the game. In Model 2, each snapshot includes the net team strength in addition to the point difference at a given second. In Model 3, each snapshot includes the rate of score change in addition to the point difference at a given second.

To effectively mitigate and prevent such criminal activity, one needs to understand the shoplifter's perspectives on the suitability of the retail products targeted for shoplifting. Extending Routine Activity Theory (RAT) from criminology literature to include usefulness of online information, we analyze shoplifters' perceptions regarding future target suitability by considering a retail item's value, inertia, visibility, and accessibility (VIVA). We also examine how online information about a target's disposal and guardianship can influence shoplifters' decisions. In this paper, the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method was used to analyze data collected in the Western New York area over a one-year period. The results show positive effects of value and reverse inertia on target suitability. Interestingly, the relationship between target suitability and the usefulness of online information about post-shoplifting disposal activity was negative.

Nonetheless, both fields have seen growing efforts to provide experimental approaches to address specific issues. Here, we review some results from a 30-year experiment in which 12 populations of bacteria have been evolving for over 60,000 generations to characterize: (i) the time scale of adaptation to new conditions, (ii) the repeatability of evolutionary changes, and (iii) the benefits and costs of specialization. In each case, we speculate on potential connections and implications of these findings for the field of economics.

The project profit is defined as the difference between the price and the cost that is comprised of production cost and earliness–tardiness penalties. In this situation, the due date determination has to be modelled as a stochastic optimisation due to stochastic duration. Conditional value at risk is thus employed as a performance measure to describe the decision-maker’s risk attitude. In fixed price contract, when the unit production cost is not smaller than the unit penalty on earliness, the optimal due date increases with the increase of the degree of a decision-maker’s risk aversion, the unit penalty on delay, and the decrease of the unit penalty on earliness. Besides, when the price is proportional to the due date and the slope is no bigger than the unit penalty on tardiness, the optimal due date is smaller than the result in fixed price. This is because high price for a short due date encourages a decision-maker to quote a small due date. Further, we compare the optimal due date in different parameter setting where the penalty coefficient of earliness is negative or zero, which means there is reward or no penalty on earliness, respectively. Finally, a case study is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CVaR; decision support systems; due date quoting; just in time; risk analysis; stochastic duration","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Decision support systems; Optimization; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; Conditional Value-at-Risk; CVaR; Due date quoting; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Fixed-price contracts; Just in time; Stochastic durations; Stochastic optimisation; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036526449

In turn, employers decide whether to lend the money through formal (i.e., written, contractual) loans or more informal ""off-the-book"" (OTB) loans. Our exploration of this understudied source of credit unearths important questions about the reasons employers lend money to employees, the manner in which they decide to make formal or informal loans, and the coveted benefits employers derive from lending to their workers. Considering the pervasiveness and significance of loan choices among small firms, and the absence of studies on the topic, we tackle these questions through an analysis of 459 informal and formal loans issued by 83 small business owners to their employees.

First, there is a positive and nonlinear relationship between the strength of inter-industry external economies and coagglomeration, a result that supports using coagglomeration to study the microfoundations of agglomeration economies and to determine the boundaries of industry clusters. Second, the equilibrium level of coagglomeration is less than the efficient level. Third, history matters in the sense that a legacy of homogeneous or heterogeneous cities tilts the economy in favor of the historical pattern.

Yet, for some brands, there may be factors that affect the strength of this density-sales relationship. The present research shows that for product categories that consumers use to signal their identities (e.g., clothing, restaurants and cars), the strength of this relationship varies with brand commonness. Consumers residing in densely populated areas are motivated to express their distinctiveness by reducing their preference for identity relevant brands that are common, such as large chains and brands owned by many people. Thus, as identity-relevant brands become more common, they suffer from a “population penalty” – a weakening of the positive effect of population density on sales. We show this effect with three experiments and two empirical analyses of automobile and alcohol sales.

To address the predictive ability of DSDs, we use two 5-factor DSDs and simultaneously run central composite designs case studies on which we will compare several common analysis methods.

Among such models, the Pareto/negative binomial distribution (Pareto/NBD) is the most prevalent in noncontractual relationships characterized by latent customer defections; ie, defections are not observed by the firm when they happen. However, this model and its applications have some shortcomings. Firstly, a methodological shortcoming is that the Pareto/NBD, like all lifetime transaction models based on statistical distributions, assumes that the number of transactions by a customer follows a Poisson distribution. However, many applications have an empirical distribution that does not fit a Poisson model. Secondly, a computational concern is that the implementation of Pareto/NBD model presents some estimation challenges specifically related to the numerous evaluation of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Finally, the model provides 4 parameters as output, which is insufficient to link the individual purchasing behavior to socio-demographic information and to predict the behavior of new customers. In this paper, we model a customer's lifetime transactions using the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution, which is a generalization of the Poisson distribution, offering more flexibility and a better fit to real-world discrete data. To estimate parameters, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which is easy to implement. Use of this Bayesian paradigm provides individual customer estimates, which help link purchase behavior to socio-demographic characteristics and an opportunity to target individual customers.

We investigate the private business case of an aggregator providing spinning reserve in California across customer end uses and business segments. Revenues are calculated using end use level hourly load profiles. With average annual revenue of ∼ $35/kW, steady end uses (e.g., lighting) are more than twice as profitable as seasonal end uses (e.g., cooling) because spinning reserve is needed year-round. Business segments with longer operating hours, such as groceries or lodging, have more revenue potential. Total costs for participation would need to be under $250/kW for many end uses and business segments to have payback periods less than 5 years, which is plausible given equipment cost data from California’s Automated Demand Response programs. Avoided carbon emission damages from using DR instead of fossil fuel generation for spinning reserve could justify incentives for DR resources. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon reduction; Demand response; Spinning reserve","Economics; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Investments; Business segments; Carbon reduction; Commercial demand; Demand response; Demand response programs; Operational constraints; Revenue potential; Spinning reserves; Proven reserves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043232098

These sheet metal fabrication shops usually follow standard families of fittings and batch-based production process, in which different customized fittings are fabricated together following a single instruction sheet, called a cut sheet. Aggregate and manual tracking systems are used to record the total fabrication labor hours for every cut sheet, which does not provide a direct means to measure the performance of fabrication of the whole batch and individual fittings. As such, the goal of this paper is to assess the feasibility of developing performance measurement models for HVAC sheet metal fabrication operations that are based on batch production with limited tracking data. Six different fabrication time estimation models with different tracking scopes and detail levels were formulated and implemented using multilinear regression and artificial neural networks. The models were trained, validated, and tested using a large sample of sheet metal fabrication data. The contributions of this study include (1) analyzing the trade-off between the formulation complexity and the reliability of their implementations, (2) implementing these formulations using two common machine learning tools (artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression) and comparing between their fit quality and prediction accuracy, and (3) examining the feasibility of reliable performance measurement models of batch production operations with only a single dependent variable (total fabrication time) and an abundance of fabrication and design variables. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Batch production; Linear regression; Mechanical ductwork; Prefabrication; Quantitative methods; Sheet metal","Economic and social effects; Fabrication; Learning systems; Linear regression; Metals; Neural networks; Production platforms; Regression analysis; Batch production; Ductworks; Mechanical contractors; Multi-linear regression; Multiple linear regressions; Performance measurements; Prefabrication; Quantitative method; Sheet metal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036462881

It applies a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis to rank 34 factors identified in literature sources as being critical to the success of megaprojects. Analysis shows that inadequate information at the tender stage, design changes during the construction phase and limited availability and supply of materials have had a major negative influence on the delivery of megaprojects in Colombia.

The model generates the lifecycle behavior of financing and growth documented in the literature, even though it contains no financial frictions. It also implies greater sensitivity of financing and growth to age for young firms, a prediction supported by empirical tests.

Also considered is the power of firm size as measured by production and firm age since founding, as moderating variables that could attenuate or heighten their impact. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered via an online survey, where 306 representatives of the US wineries responded. Data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, multinomial logistic regression, cross-tabulations and Pearson chi-square (χ2) analysis. Findings: Wine businesses that reported increased sales and profits over the previous three years made significant changes to organizational structure and staffing levels. Wineries that reported flat or decreasing sales and profits were less apt to make changes in organizational structure or staffing levels. Firm age was found to mediate performance in terms of incremental sales and profit growth; firm size was found to mediate only incremental profit growth.

Although precise input and output data are fundamentally indispensable in classical DEA models, real-world problems often involve random and/or rough input and output data. We present a chance- constrained DEA model with random and rough (random-rough) input and output data and propose a deterministic equivalent model with quadratic constraints to solve the model. The main contributions of this paper are fourfold: (3.1) we propose a DEA model for problems characterized by random-rough variables; (3.2) we transform the proposed chance-constrained model with random-rough variables into a deterministic equivalent non-linear form that could be simplified as a deterministic model with quadratic constraints; (3.3) we perform sensitivity analysis to investigate the stability and robustness of the proposed model; and (3.4) we use a numerical example to demonstrate the feasibility and richness of the obtained solutions. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2018.","alpha- pessimistic.; alpha-optimistic; chance-constrained programming; Data envelopment analysis; random and rough data","Computer programming; Data envelopment analysis; Mathematical transformations; Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; alpha- pessimistic; alpha-optimistic; Chance-constrained data envelopment analysis; Chance-constrained model; Chance-constrained programming; Deterministic equivalents; Rough data; Stability and robustness; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042662413

However, observations from different domains (e.g. healthcare, business, etc.) have suggested that collaboration sometimes involves people with differing levels of access to underlying information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level Collaborative Information Retrieval (MLCIR). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of awareness, an existing CIR/CIS concept, on MLCIR. To address this gap in current knowledge, we conducted two separate user studies using a total of 5 different collaborative search interfaces and 3 information access scenarios. A number of Information Retrieval (IR), CIS and CIR evaluation metrics, as well as questionnaires were used to compare the interfaces. Design interviews were also conducted after evaluations to obtain qualitative feedback from participants. Results suggested that query properties such as time spent on query, query popularity and query effectiveness could allow users to obtain information about team's search performance and implicitly suggest better queries without disclosing sensitive data. Besides, having access to a history of intersecting viewed, relevant and bookmarked documents could provide similar positive effect as query properties. Also, it was found that being able to easily identify different team members and their actions is important for users in MLCIR. Based on our findings, we provide important design recommendations to help develop new CIR and MLCIR interfaces. © 2017","Awareness; Collaborative search; Information access; Multi-level collaboration; Non-uniform access","Surveys; Awareness; Collaborative searches; Information access; Multilevels; Non-uniform access; Information retrieval",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030251624

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved in many countries for ADHD treatment in children, adolescents, and adults. Objectives: Estimate the cost-effectiveness of LDX as a first- or second-line treatment for adults with ADHD from the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) perspective compared with methylphenidate extended release (MPH-ER) and atomoxetine (ATX). Methods: A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed. Health outcomes included response, non-response and inability to tolerate. Efficacy data were obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). Response was a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression–Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates due to adverse events. Utilities were identified via a systematic literature review. Health care resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were estimated from mean doses reported in the trials used in the MTC. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. Results: LDX dominated MPH-ER and ATX; reducing mean per-patient annual cost by £5 and £200, and increasing mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. In the PSA, the probability of cost-effectiveness for LDX vs. MPH-ER and ATX at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY was 61% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions: From the perspective of the UK NHS, LDX is likely to provide a cost-effective treatment for adults with ADHD. This conclusion may be drawn with more certainty in comparison with ATX than with MPH-ER. © 2017, The Author(s).","ADHD; Adult; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Economic evaluation; Lisdexamfetamine","atomoxetine; lisdexamfetamine; methylphenidate; central stimulant agent; lisdexamfetamine; Article; attention deficit disorder; Clinical Global Impression scale; cost effectiveness analysis; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; drug use; drug utilization; economic model; follow up; health survey; human; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; sensitivity analysis; treatment response; United Kingdom; adult; attention deficit disorder; cost benefit analysis; economics; literature; treatment outcome; Adult; Atomoxetine Hydrochloride; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate; Review Literature as Topic; Treatment Outcome; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009509060

Thus, even when environmental taxes are imposed, firms may be unable (or unwilling) to adjust their behaviour and technology in response to price signals. With a focus on energy and material efficiency investments, this paper systematically investigates how the theoretical assumptions of perfectly competitive and efficient markets are violated in practice, and how this results in complex and interlinked investment barriers. It classifies five categories of investment barriers: information, capacity, and financial constraints, as well as uncompetitive market structures and fiscal mismanagement; and presents evidence on each of these. It concludes by proposing a range of measures for mitigating investment barriers, and addressing their structural causes.

Of particular interest is the impact on overall strategic direction and health system performance that results from selecting a CEO from inside the firm as opposed to seeking outside leadership. Empirical work-to-date has yielded mixed results. Much of this variability has been attributed to design flaws; however, in the absence of a clear message from the evidence, the preference for hiring ""outsiders"" continues to grow. Purpose: This paper investigates on the extent to which insider CEO succession versus outsider succession impacts hospitals' competitive advantage vis-à-vis a sample of organizations that compete in the same sector. Methods: A hospital matching protocol based on propensity scores is used to control for endogeneity and makes comparisons of productivity across organizations through the use of stochastic frontier estimation. Findings: Succession negatively impacts hospitals' productivity, and firms with outsider CEO succession events closed the gap toward the competitive advantage frontier faster than comparable firms with insider successions.

These projects provide students with valuable learning experiences that they would not otherwise receive working individually. However, student group projects come with some unique challenges, such as unequal distribution of work, unequal levels of learning, and perceptions of fairness. Situating the case: While many instructor-led resources and strategies exist for facilitating group projects, fewer student-empowering strategies exist. Data provide one potential way to empower students to take ownership of their team experience and make more informed decisions throughout the teamwork process. About the case: This teaching case was born out of a response to the many teamwork problems that are outlined in the literature and that the author has observed as an instructor. This teaching case describes the implementation and outcomes of a data-driven framework for decision making called collect, analyze, triangulate, and act (CAT) that the author developed. After they learned about the CATA framework, the students completed a series of data-driven exercises during the team formation, team functioning, and team evaluation stages of the team project. Perceptions of CATA's effectiveness were collected after the project ended. Methods: A mixed-methods approach, which included a survey and a series of interviews, was used to gain insights into how both team members and team leaders perceived the CATA framework. Results: Survey results indicated that students found the CATA framework helpful in many team contexts. Students expressed particularly strong opinions about how CATA aided in the fairness and accuracy of peer evaluations, was helpful for self-reflection, and was useful for making informed arguments to convince team members of a decision. Interviews with team leaders revealed that appealing to data using the CATA framework was helpful in managing the team but had limited capacity to aid in managing conflict. Conclusions: Students realized many benefits from the CATA framework, and some team leaders even felt empowered in certain instances by appealing to data. However, instructors should still consider scaffolding data literacy and teamwork skills for students to be fully prepared for successful teamwork. © 2018 IEEE.","data literacy; Data-driven decision making; teamwork; technical and professional communication","Decision making; Education; Personnel; Professional aspects; Scaffolds; Surveys; Teaching; Technical writing; Data driven decision; data literacy; Media; Professional communication; Teamwork; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055018849

Our model utilizes a multinomial logit choice model transformed into a mixed-integer linear program through the Charnes–Cooper transformation. It is able to scale to problems that contain thousands of configurations to possibly be offered, a necessity given the number of possible configurations an automaker can build. In addition, most research in assortment planning contains simplified costs associated with product complexity. We better account for design, integration, manufacturing, and supply chain complexities that stem from large product assortments. We believe that our model can significantly aid automotive manufacturers to balance their product complexity with supply chain complexity to improve profitability of vehicle programs. We also present results from a case study motivated by a large global automotive original equipment manufacturer. © 2017, © Operational Research Society 2017.","Assortment planning; automotive; discrete choice; supply chain complexity; supply chain management","Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Integer programming; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Product design; Profitability; Strategic planning; Assortment planning; automotive; Automotive manufacturers; Discrete choice; Mixed integer linear program; Original equipment manufacturers; Strategic planning process; Supply chain complexity; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028819565

Past studies note that individuals of digital fluency present distinctive behaviors in technology use. However, limited research has explored how digital fluency affects the relationship between individual gratifications and social media use. Based on the uses and gratifications theory and digital fluency literatures, we develop a model to explore the relationships among digital fluency, gratifications, and social media use. We test the model using survey data from 262 users of WeChat, which is the most popular social media platform in China. Results show that digital fluency is positively associated with social media use. Moreover, we find that digital fluency negatively moderates the impacts of maintaining ties, enjoyment, and information need fulfillment on social media use, whereas it positively moderates the impact of broadening social network. Our findings contribute to the literature by identifying the theoretical and practical roles of digital fluency in social media use. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

In addition to documenting broad differences in obstacles to business within and across the region, we particularly focus on the main obstacles affecting small and medium-sized firms. The econometric analysis highlights three main barriers at a regional level: an inadequately educated workforce; access to finance; and crime, theft and disorder. However, there are variations at the country level and the analysis indicates clusters of countries that experience obstacles to similar degrees.

The most persistent and puzzling pricing anomaly associated with price-implied prediction probabilities is the favourite-longshot bias (FLB). We demonstrate that existing models of the FLB fail to capture its full complexity, thereby preventing appropriate adjustments to market forecasts to improve their accuracy. We develop an agent-based model with heterogeneous agents in a fixed-odds market. Our agent-based simulations and comprehensive analysis using market data demonstrate that our model explains real market behaviour, including that of market makers, better than existing theories. Importantly, our results suggest that adequately complex models are necessary to describe complex phenomena such as pricing anomalies.

Modelling the satisfactory level of dyadic relationship performance is very useful for identifying when the relationship begins to move away from the desired state. We then use the designed control chart to monitor the relationship between dyads over time to determine if any unusual behaviour has occurred (Phase II) and illustrate its implementation through a case study from the auto industry.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the degree to which data-based ethical decision making, lateral relations and organizational commitment are interrelated in organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from business professionals employed at multiple locations of a financial services firm operating in the USA. Mediation analysis (based on structural equation modeling) was used to test the proposed relationships. Findings: Results indicated that employees’ perceptions of data-based ethical decision making were positively related to perceived lateral relations, and that perceived lateral relations were positively related to organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications: Given that information was collected using only a self-report questionnaire, common method bias could be an issue. In addition, the study’s cross-sectional design limits conclusions about causality. Another limitation involves the study’s homogenous sample, which decreases the generalizability of the findings. Finally, variable responses could have been impacted by individual frames of reference and other perceptual differences. Practical implications: Results suggest that information flow enhancements should support or be consistent with horizontal information flow enhancements, and that together these factors should increase employee commitment. Originality/value: Given the dearth of existing research, this interdisciplinary investigation is important because it fills gaps in the management literature. This study is also important because the results could inform decisions regarding the use of data analysis in ethical decisions and lateral forms of organizational structuring to improve work attitudes. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Decision making; Employee attitudes; Employee relations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049796255

Increasing demands for water use will require tourism to improve and disclose its monitoring and reporting, particularly for water-intensive activities such as golf tourism. Using a sample of 129 courses from Ontario (Canada), this is the first study to examine golf course characteristics that influence water use variability (e.g. dominant soil type, ownership type, and age of course). By establishing “best in class” water use efficiency among common types of courses, potential water extraction savings of 35% are identified (or 6.75 billion litres annually). Importantly, the study also accounts for the influence of climate variability on water use by comparing a climatically normal season (for the 1981–2010 period) with an anomalously dry and warm season to examine the potential impact of future climate change on water use (i.e. reduced precipitation and higher temperatures). Average water use effectively almost doubles during an anomalously dry-warm season (increasing from 59.6 to 94.2 million litres), accentuating the importance of achieving potential water use efficiencies. In addition to best management practices, the need to reshape public perceptions of golf course aesthetics is also discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; golf; management; sustainability; tourism; Water","best management practice; climate change; ecotourism; golf course; optimization; warming; water use efficiency; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045771665

It is found that there is a close correlation between the growth of non-industry and industry (Kaldor’s first law) that provides indirect evidence for the export-base theory. The paper discusses two competing explanations of the foundations of the Verdoorn law (Kaldor’s second law), which, in its simplest form, is the relationship between industrial productivity and output growth. It also considers the static–dynamic Verdoorn law paradox. This arises from the fact that estimating the Verdoorn law in log-levels often gives statistically insignificant estimates of the Verdoorn coefficient while the use of growth rates gives significant values of around one half. The results show that this does not occur when data for the cities are used. A plausible explanation for the paradox is that it results from spatial aggregation bias. It is also found that inter-province urban productivity disparities first increase, but subsequently decrease over the period considered. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Cities of Jiangsu province; Kaldor’s laws; productivity growth; Static–dynamic Verdoorn law paradox","economic growth; industrial production; productivity; urban area; urban economy; China; Jiangsu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023767870

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method study in the context of eight alliances participating in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Aligning Forces for Quality program. Data collection approaches included surveys of alliance participants and semi-structured interviews with alliance leaders. Findings: The findings indicate that dependence on grant revenues, in particular, may be problematic for how well alliances are positioned for sustainability. While a number of approaches were identified to reduce dependence on grants, implementing these strategies presented more of a challenge for alliances due to the contextual demands of their external environment and a need to strike a balance between pursuing alternative revenue sources and fidelity to the mission and identity of the organization. Practical implications: Alliance leaders need to have not only a broad and accurate understanding of their external environment, but also an appreciation of the alliance’s identity in that environment. Collectively, the findings can help organizational leaders be more informed about their funding choices and the implications those choices have for the future of their organization. Originality/value: Collaborative forms of organizations (e.g. alliances, coalitions, networks) are increasingly viewed as an effective means of addressing complex, multifaceted health, and social challenges.

To better understand the antecedents of financial planning behavior, the purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of cultural values in financial decision making within the context of Hispanic American consumers. A new conceptual model is proposed to integrate affect (cultural value) and cognition (financial knowledge) in financial planning. Design/methodology/approach: To uncover respondents’ views on cultural values, financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial planning behavior, an online survey hosted on a business school’s website was distributed to members of two Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. The survey consisted of five parts, and took each respondent an average of 15 minutes to complete. The final data set has 158 observations. Findings: Results analyzed using structural equation modeling confirmed the hypotheses that financial knowledge, attitude, and perceived control simultaneously influence Hispanic consumers’ intentions to purchase financial planning products or services. More interestingly, these results confirm that multiple different routes coexist in the decision-making process, especially within the Hispanic financial planning context. Originality/value: Key contributions of this paper include the conceptualization of cultural value as an antecedent to Hispanic financial behavior; detailing the different routes to financial decision making for US Hispanic consumers; and informing financial service managers on marketing strategies toward Hispanic consumers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Familism; Hispanic consumers; Insurance companies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047662996

With companies under pressure to expand product variety yet maintain good forecast accuracy understanding this relationship is critical. We use data gathered pre and post a vertical integration event, where some information forecasted prior to the merger was now available. We show that increasing product variety, and thus the number of forecasts, indeed deteriorates both forecast accuracy and bias. The vertical integration event, providing information sharing, results in improved forecast performance. Further, different product variety attributes (e.g. brand variety and pack variety) are found to have differing impacts. Increasing brand variety is found to have a significantly greater impact on forecast accuracy than pack variety. Using the vertical integration event as a natural experiment we document that expanding product variety negatively impacts forecasts and that information can help mitigated the impact. This is an important contribution as it tests the value of ‘truthful’ information given the elimination of the firm boundary post merger.

When combined with technology like mobile computing and low cost analytic techniques, data can now be leveraged by companies to dynamically offer individualised promotions in real time. This paper considers the relative value of three retail information elements which can be used by retailers to dynamically identify a subset of product offerings to promote to their customers. The retail information elements considered are: (a) product markup, (b) customer preference estimates gleaned from purchase history and (c) retailer inventory positions. The importance of each element is evaluated singularly and in combination as is their effect on promotion success, inventory costs and average markup. Computational results show that, on average, dynamic promotion policies incorporating all retail information elements can increase expected profit by 14.5% over policies that consider only customer preference and by 8.4–9.1% over policies that consider only product margin or inventory. Results demonstrate that customer preference information alone does little to improve performance but provides substantial synergistic benefits when combined with either inventory or markup information elements. The most information intensive dynamic promotion policy is then extended to include price as a decision variable. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytics; dynamic promotion; optimisation; retail; simulation","Costs; analytics; Computational results; Customer preferences; Information elements; Inventory information; Optimisations; retail; simulation; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038118553

Because these benefits arise from data and information sharing, they are best studied at a process level. Medical claims fraud detection is a prototypical data- and information-intensive process in insurance companies. Fraud detection efforts of one insurer can create spillover benefits through data and information sharing that occur from socialization between analysts and labor mobility between insurers. This paper theorizes three semi-collaborative networks formed between state-level subsidiaries of insurers (regulation-bound network), between subsidiaries of an insurer parent company (sibling network), and between insurers and hospitals (risk-sharing), and hypothesizes that these networks convey information spillovers. Because benefits realized by another party can lead to the reduction of IT investments by that party, the paper also examines the impact of semi-collaborative networks on future IT-related investments. The empirical analysis was conducted using 2011-2013 data. A generalized linear model with a Tweedie distribution is used to correct for the finite mass of zeros for the dependent variables. The results reveal that the sibling network conveyed most of the spillover benefit, and the risk-sharing network did not contribute to fraud detection. The sibling network is also found to depress future spending on fraud detection. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Research questions: 1. What prior experience do students and instructors have with usability testing? 2. What are their challenges with implementing usability testing in technical communication courses? 3. What are their recommendations for improving their efforts? About the case: This study was conducted in 2012 at a small Midwestern university where students and instructors in four sections of technical communication service courses participated in the study. Situating the case: Most technical communication scholarship focuses on usability practices, methods, or tools, and rarely explicitly addresses its pedagogy, especially the practical challenges faced by our students and instructors. Methods/approach: Data were gathered through preliminary and post-project student surveys and instructor interviews. Thematic coding was used to analyze the data. Results/discussion: Students faced the usual practical challenges such as time and resource constraints and collaboration with users. They found strategies such as using in-class activities, readings, and examples, and working directly with users to be helpful in their usability efforts. Instructors expressed the need for better preparation. Conclusions: Instructors should not only be required to take a usability course that will prepare them to be more effective usability instructors, but they should also incorporate readings and examples that will help students collaborate effectively with users and clients. The study is limited to research participants at one institution. Future research should involve larger, ethnographic studies of diverse students and instructors to address more aspects of usability pedagogy. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Instructor interview; pedagogy; practical challenges; service courses; student survey; teaching; usability testing; users","Education; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Testing; Tools; Collaboration; Instructor interview; Interviews; pedagogy; practical challenges; service courses; Student surveys; Usability; Usability testing; users; Usability engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038809606

In practice, this kind of analysis is only a minor indication of the actual economic significance of the forecast that has been developed. For this reason, in our approach, we also include a test of our forecast through trading an appropriate volatility derivative. As a method we use parametric and artificial intelligence models. We also combine these models in order to achieve a hybrid forecast. We report that the results of all three model types are of similar quality. However, we observe that artificial intelligence models are able to achieve these results with a shorter input time frame and the errors are uniformly lower comparing with the parametric one. Similarly, the chosen models do not appear to differ much while the analysis of trading efficiency is performed.

The social signal for a product is given by its current market share raised to power r (or, equivalently, the number of purchases raised to the power of r). The paper shows that, when r is strictly between 0 and 1, and a static position assignment (e.g., a quality ranking) is used, the market converges to a unique equilibrium where the market shares depend only on product quality, not their initial appeals or the early dynamics. When r is greater than 1, the market becomes unpredictable. In many cases, the market goes to a monopoly for some product: which product becomes a monopoly depends on the initial conditions of the market. These theoretical results are complemented by an agent-based simulation which indicates that convergence is fast when r is between 0 and 1, and that the quality ranking dominates the well-known popularity ranking in terms of market efficiency. These results shed a new light on the role of social influence which is often blamed for unpredictability, inequalities, and inefficiencies in markets. In contrast, this paper shows that, with a proper social signal and position assignment for the products, the market becomes predictable, and inequalities and inefficiencies can be controlled appropriately. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Popularity signals; Ranking policies; Robbins–Monro algorithms; Social influence; Stochastic dynamics; System dynamics","Commerce; Competition; Electronic trading; Stochastic systems; Agent based simulation; Consumer preferences; Initial conditions; Popularity ranking; Robbins-Monro algorithms; Social influence; Stochastic dynamics; System Dynamics; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034056880

If market power is ignored and increases with size, it gets counted as additional cost efficiencies which leads to an over-prediction. I address this limitation by developing a model of the demand for consumer deposits at the geographic market level and cost efficiencies at the firm level. Incorporating the network structure of banks in the analysis increases dimensionality of the bank's choice set and also the possibility of multiple equilibria. To address these issues, I use moment inequality methods to estimate the cost parameters. Using a panel data from the U.S. banking industry, I find that the evidence of cost efficiencies is weak, at best, for all the banks. Using the estimated parameters, I simulate six mergers between banks of different sizes. In the short run, all the simulated mergers show dis-economies of scale on average. However, most of them show an increase in consumer welfare as the market power (or oligopoly) effect is dominated by an increase in the local branch density. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Banking industry; Cost efficiency; Market power; Moment inequality","Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Banking industry; Cost efficiency; Economies of scale; Estimated parameter; Market Power; Moment inequality; Multiple equilibrium; Network structures; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042885027

Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we use data from the German DRG statistic on patient characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of all isolated TAVI procedures in 2013 (N = 9147). The impact of post-procedural complications on reimbursement, length of stay and mechanical ventilation was analyzed using both unadjusted and risk-adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 235 (2.57%) strokes, 583 (6.37%) bleeding events, 474 (5.18%) cases of acute kidney injury and 1428 (15.61%) pacemaker implantations were documented. The predicted reimbursement of an uncomplicated TAVI procedure was €33,272, and bleeding events were associated with highest additional reimbursement (€12,839, p < 0.001), extra length of stay (14.58 days, p < 0.001), and increased likelihood of mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h (OR 17.91, p < 0.001). A more moderate complication-related impact on resource use and reimbursement was found for acute kidney injury (additional reimbursement: €5963, p < 0.001; extra length of stay: 7.92 days, p < 0.001; ventilation >48 h: OR 6.93, p < 0.001) as well as for stroke (additional reimbursement: €4125, p < 0.001; extra length of stay: 4.68 days, p < 0.001; ventilation >48 h: OR 5.73, p < 0.001). Pacemaker implantations, in contrast, were associated with comparably small increases in reimbursement (€662, p = 0.006) and length of stay (3.54 days, p = 0.006) and no impaired likelihood of mechanical ventilation more than 48 h (OR 1.22, p = 0.156). Interestingly, these complication-related consequences remain mostly unchanged after baseline risk-adjustment. Conclusions: Post procedural complications such as bleeding events, acute kidney injuries and strokes are associated with increased resource use and substantial amounts of additional reimbursement in Germany, which has important implications for decision making outside of the usual clinical sphere. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Excess costs; Post-procedural complications; Reimbursement; Resource use; TAVR; Transcatheter aortic valve replacement","acute kidney failure; age; aged; aortic valve stenosis; Article; artificial ventilation; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; diagnosis related group; EuroSCORE; female; gender; Germany; health care cost; human; hypertension; length of stay; major clinical study; male; New York Heart Association class; observational study; pacemaker implantation; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; reimbursement; resource allocation; retrospective study; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; ventilated patient; very elderly; aortic valve stenosis; economics; health care organization; risk factor; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; treatment outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Female; Germany; Health Care Coalitions; Humans; Insurance, Health, Reimbursement; Length of Stay; Male; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013420767

Objective and Method: While these programs have been evaluated with respect to their implications for care quality and financial viability, this is the first study to assess the relationship between hospitals’ cost inefficiency and their participation in the programs. We estimate a translog specification of a stochastic cost frontier with controls for participation in the HVBP program and clinical and outcome quality for California hospitals for 2012–2015. Results: The program-participation indicators’ parameters imply that participants were more cost inefficient than their peers. Further, the estimated coefficients for summary process of care quality indexes for three health conditions (acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and heart failure) suggest that higher quality scores are associated with increased operating costs. Conclusion: The estimated coefficients for the outcome quality variables suggest that future determination of HVBP payment adjustments, which will depend solely on mortality rates as measures of clinical care quality, may not only be aligned with increasing healthcare quality but also reducing healthcare costs. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"acute heart infarction; Article; California; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; health care cost; health care quality; heart failure; hospital cost; hospital purchasing; mandatory program; medicare; mortality rate; pneumonia; cost benefit analysis; economics; health economics; hospital cost; hospital purchasing; human; legislation and jurisprudence; mandatory program; Markov chain; medicare; organization and management; purchasing; statistical model; United States; California; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Economics, Hospital; Hospital Costs; Humans; Mandatory Programs; Medicare; Models, Econometric; Purchasing, Hospital; Stochastic Processes; United States; Value-Based Purchasing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032340426

The combination of longevity risk, increasing market risk triggered by taking distributions from assets, and spending shocks create new challenges. Wealth management has traditionally focused on accumulating assets without applying further thought to these differences happening after retirement. Retirees experience reduced capacity to bear financial market risk once they have retired. This calls for different thought processes from those typically included in traditional investment management. Risk pooling becomes an important retirement income tool combined with a traditional investment portfolio.

This study compares and contrasts the two different purchase motivations of consumers: social influence and hedonic performance expectancy. A survey was conducted with 243 users of on-demand music streaming services. Our data analysis shows that social influence impacts consumer attitudes towards music streaming, which in turn drive purchase intention. On the other hand, continuance intention of paid music streaming is driven by hedonic performance expectancy of consumers, not consumer attitude. These results imply that the music industry needs to differentiate its approach to prospective and current customers of music streaming services.

By using a nested model to examine industry to firm interactions, they are able to control for problematic violations of statistical assumptions that are likely to bias estimates from conventional methods. Their analysis shows that all of the industry factors we examined had significant interaction effects. Specifically, industry concentration, industry growth, industry capital intensity, industry outsourcing, and presence in service sector significantly impact firm-level IT value. More interestingly, the authors find these impacts manifest not as mean differences between industries, but rather as interactions with firm-level effects.

We propose that the degree of effort exertion in the presence of income tax depends on people's attitudes toward two key components of taxation: redistribution and government intervention. For people favorable toward both, working while taxed is aligned with personal identity and may actually enhance motivation. All others, however, may find taxes demotivating. In two incentive-compatible labor experiments, framing wages as subject to an income tax significantly increased productivity among people chronically favorable toward both redistribution and government intervention. For everyone else, taxes did not reliably influence productivity. An objectively equivalent intervention that did not redistribute a portion of participants' wages (framed as a wage “match” rather than a “tax”) did not motivate anyone to work harder. Our findings suggest that the net effect of income tax on productivity partly depends on the distribution of attitudes toward redistribution and government intervention.

Previous studies focus on the use of country-specific factors to explain countries’ exchange rate regime choices. However, though some papers found strong correlation between idiosyncratic factors and ERR choices, these factors cannot fully explain the contemporary movement of the choices. It is possible that large swings in regime choices are caused by network effects: a few countries change their ERR and other countries follow. If this snowball effect is true for countries’ decisions, we should be able to observe spatial autocorrelations among countries’ ERR choices.

More specifically, this study investigates the relationship between productivity and customer satisfaction and its effect on a firm’s performance. In addition, this study investigates the roles of productivity and customer satisfaction in the structural relationships among variables. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was proposed among innovation, productivity, customer satisfaction and firm performance. A sample of 127 firms from data sets of the American Customer Satisfaction Index and COMPUSTAT was collected. To test the hypotheses, this study used ordinal least squares analysis and path analysis. Findings: The findings of this study verified that a positive relationship exists between productivity and customer satisfaction and that service productivity and customer satisfaction are positively associated with a firm’s performance. In addition, customer satisfaction was found to fully mediate the relationship between productivity and a firm’s performance. Research limitations/implications: This study only focused on a short period for each variable due to the difficulty of matching all the data sets used for measuring each variable, which limited the observation of the different effects of service productivity among industries. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that managers can improve productivity without sacrificing customer satisfaction. In addition, services firms should consider innovation, productivity and customer satisfaction in a holistic way because all of these affect a firm’s performance. Furthermore, services firms need to pay more attention to customer satisfaction, which plays an important role as a mediator in increasing a firm’s performance. Originality/value: This study highlights the importance of the relationship between productivity and customer satisfaction in the services sector. In particular, this study extended the theory of service productivity by Rust and Huang (2012) to explore the role of service productivity and customer satisfaction in measuring a firm’s performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer satisfaction; Innovation; Productivity; Service",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054412386

A recent study proposed the copula DCC based on the vine structure. Due to the arbitrary variable selection, their method can produce unnecessary dependence in the multivariate structure, with extra economic and computational burdens. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate directional dependence by copula to track the causal relationship among multiple variables and then extend the copula bivariate DCC method to a directional time varying partial correlation in the multivariate structure. Our proposed method provides a reasonable and efficient conditional dependence structure, without the trial and error process.

However, structural drivers, such as product complexity and stringent performance requirements, inhibit the uptake of new technologies and present challenges to portfolio management specific to technology-rich environments. Although project risk is often managed through staged funding processes associated with intermediate milestones, this process is typically decoupled from portfolio valuation. In this paper, we use a simple real options binomial tree model to value the National Aeronautics and Space Administration portfolio funded through the Small Business Innovation Research program, accounting quantitatively for the funding stages and future opportunities accompanying technology infusion. For the 2009 portfolio, the average net project investment is $166k, suggesting the important role that early-stage funding plays in launching innovation efforts.

On the other hand, pay differential within a job level (horizontal pay dispersion) is theorized to positively moderate the ESO–productivity relationship. These predictions are partially supported. Consistent with the prediction, vertical pay dispersion negatively moderates the ESO–productivity relationship in that the relationship is more negative when vertical pay dispersion is high.

Local commissioning bodies need to prioritise investments in health care, but previous studies provide limited evidence to inform the decision to expand existing services on the basis of cost-effectiveness. We examine the impact of specialist rehabilitation services in the subregion on hospital length of stay (LoS) and associated costs compared to routine care. Methods: Comparison of hospital LoS and associated costs in centres with greater access (Hull) and limited access (i.e. routine care, York and Northern Lincolnshire), to specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disabilities following illness or injury, using Hospital Episodes Statistics data. Results: Average LoS and duration costs by Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) were lower for the majority of patients with greater access to specialist rehabilitation compared to routine care. Difference in LoS between groups widened with level of complexity within each HRG. For the more frequent HRG codes, the LoS difference was as high as 34 days longer for York compared to Hull and £7900 more costly. Conclusion: Rehabilitation patients within York and Northern Lincolnshire areas appear to have longer LoS and higher associated costs compared to those admitted to the Hull Trust. This analysis suggests that specialist rehabilitation may be cost saving compared to routine care and supports the case for expansion of the existing services to improve coverage in the area. © 2017, The Author(s).","Complex disability; Length of stay; Local decision making; Specialist rehabilitation; Trauma","Article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; disability; England; health care cost; hospital episode statistics; hospitalization; human; injury; length of stay; priority journal; rehabilitation care; rehabilitation center; rehabilitation patient; specialist rehabilitation; statistical analysis; statistics; cost benefit analysis; economics; health care planning; hospital cost; hospitalization; rehabilitation; Cost-Benefit Analysis; England; Health Care Costs; Health Resources; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Length of Stay; Rehabilitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039839249

The teams’ coaching staffs are often part-time employees that lack the time, budgets, and/or ability for the pre-competitive tactical analysis required for optimal assignment of athletes to events. In response to this often overlooked aspect of coaching, we present a new open-source spreadsheet-based DSS, MeetOpt, that offers coaches a decision making tool for the optimal athlete-to-event assignment. MeetOpt utilizes mixed-integer programming to create a lineup that maximizes the expected team score under a variety of common meet formats and assignment constraints. In addition, this framework is flexible enough to allow for the inclusion of opponent performance scenarios through the use of stochastic mixed-integer programming. We use real data to illustrate the value of this DSS in comparison with a commonly used decision aid utilizing a simple ranking criteria. In addition, we discuss the additional complexities when competing against teams in double duals - a meet with three teams scored as two head-to-head meets. Our results illustrate the sensitivity of a meet outcome to a selected lineup and the complexity associated with this decision process. © 2018","Assignment problem; Mixed integer programming; Swimming; Track and field","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Open source software; Sports; Stochastic systems; Assignment problems; Decision making tool; Decision process; Mixed integer programming; Optimal assignment; Stochastic mixed integer programming; Swimming; Track and fields; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049341312

The spirit of this new deal of a bespoke decision-aid has indeed been that the decision maker’s own preferences, including risk tolerance and attribute selection, as opposed to the standardized goals or discretionarily assigned objectives of the analyst, should be paramount in selecting the most satisfactory strategy. But this way of implementing decision-aid has not received in practice as wide an application as it should have, due to some unduly persistent although erroneous objections. Eliciting the preferences of someone else has thus been regarded as some logically impossible task. The present article argues that such suspicions are today obsolete and that most of the evoked biases or objections can be overcome by using methods of elicitation ignored by textbooks. In particular, the article presents a complete set of non-parametric methods that avoid the above biases and objections. It suggests that a number of fields of application, in wealth management and finance as well as in human resources management and managerial choices, urgently call for such genuinely bespoke decision-aid. © The authors 2016.

In two experiments, we measured choice behavior in two experimental paradigms of DfE and self-reported maximizing tendencies using three prominent scales of maximization. In the repeated consequentialist choice paradigm, participants made repeated choices between two unlabeled options and received consequential feedback on each trial. In the sampling paradigm, participants freely sampled from two options and received feedback on their sampling before making a single consequential choice. Individuals exhibited different degrees of maximizing behavior in both paradigms and across different payoff distributions, but none of the maximizing scales predicted this behavior. These results indicate that maximization scales address constructs that are different from the maximization behavior observed in DfE, and that these measures will need to be improved to reflect behavioral aspects of choice and search from experience.

I evaluate the performance of a weighted parallel trends (WPT) DD estimator in a Monte Carlo study and provide an application to a case study context in which a benchmark estimate exists.

Recently, GPs in England have been urged to limit the duration of repeat prescriptions, where clinically appropriate, to 28 days to reduce wastage and hence contain costs. However, shorter prescriptions will increase transaction costs and thus may not be cost saving. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that shorter prescriptions are associated with lower adherence, which would be expected to lead to lower clinical benefit. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 3-month versus 28-day repeat prescriptions from the perspective of the NHS. Methods: We adapted three previously developed UK policy-relevant models, incorporating transaction (dispensing fees, prescriber time) and drug wastage costs associated with 3-month and 28-day prescriptions in three case studies: antihypertensive medications for prevention of cardiovascular events; drugs to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes; and treatments for depression. Results: In all cases, 3-month prescriptions were associated with lower costs and higher QALYs than 28-day prescriptions. This is driven by assumptions that higher adherence leads to improved disease control, lower costs and improved QALYs. Conclusion: Longer repeat prescriptions may be cost-effective compared with shorter ones. However, the quality of the evidence base on which this modelling is based is poor. Any policy rollout should be within the context of a trial such as a stepped-wedge cluster design. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,"antihypertensive agent; metformin; placebo; serotonin uptake inhibitor; prescription drug; Article; cardiovascular disease; case study; chronic disease; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; depression; disease control; essential hypertension; glycemic control; health care cost; human; national health service; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prescription; quality adjusted life year; treatment duration; United Kingdom; chronic disease; cost benefit analysis; economics; England; general practice; health care policy; national health service; outcome assessment; prescription; Chronic Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug Prescriptions; England; General Practice; Health Policy; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prescription Drugs; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; State Medicine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044863037

Diaries on smartphones (mobile diaries) can be used as a research tool for such purposes. A mobile diary is a self-report instrument whereby people use their mobile handset to repeatedly report experiences of interest. Mobile diaries are increasingly used in psychology, geography, medicine, and commercial marketing. Yet they have rarely been used for quantitative marketing research, and were not benchmarked against best-practice metrics in marketing. In this study, we aim to set the ground for using mobile diaries in quantitative marketing research. We first lay out the theoretical infrastructure for the usage of mobile diaries, and describe possible respondent reporting concerns, including concerns related to non-reporting, reporting over time, and concerns stemming from individual-level heterogeneity. We demonstrate the potential of mobile diaries, as well as the importance of the various concerns, using a benchmark test case in the context of primetime TV viewing. Our benchmark uses a sample of respondents with both mobile diary viewing reports and Nielsen People Meter (NPM) records. Our analysis reveals that averaging across all conditions, 47.4%–64.7% of the NPM records are reported by the diary. The major sources for mismatch are random time periods without alarms, short viewings, and periodic reporting inactivity (pulsing). Concerns such as a decrease in reporting rates over time (e.g., fatigue), smartphone ownership, and demographic variation across individuals have relatively small effects on reporting likelihood. Analyzing the cases in which diary reports do not have a matching NPM record, we find many of them can be attributed to out-of-home viewing and viewing on non-metered devices. This finding demonstrates how mobile diaries can complement metered measurements. Overall, aggregate diary-based ratings have a 0.90 correlation with NPM ratings. We discuss implications for designing and using mobile diary studies in marketing. © 2018","Audience measurement; Experience sampling method; Longitudinal studies; Mobile diaries; Nielsen People Meter; Self-reports; Survey errors; Survey validity; Surveys; Television viewing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041628376

The increase in GDP per capita that ASEAN economies experienced during 1970–2010 significantly contributed to a higher share of income accruing to the middle class in these countries. Econometric model estimates show that the impact of a rise of the middle class on economic growth depends on initial levels of GDP per capita. In the majority of ASEAN countries, a rise of the middle class that is unrelated to GDP per capita growth would have had a significant negative effect on economic growth for levels of ASEAN economies’ GDP per capita in 1970. In contrast, for recent values of GDP per capita a rise of the middle class would positively contribute to growth of GDP per capita in ASEAN.

The MM estimator, multiple M-estimator, was defined as the best method to perform the data analysis and to derive the robust regression model to estimate HPV. Depending on the car class, the vehicle variety, model types, annual working days, car assembly utilisation and launching a new model penalise HPV; however, annual production volume, flexible manufacturing and year of production improve HPV.

We assume that the residuals obtained from fitting the linear model in the transformed space are iid zero-mean normal random variables, at least approximately. We discuss the bias in the retransformed mean and derive a reduced-bias estimator for the kth moment of the original response, given settings of the design variables. This is then used to compute reduced-bias estimates for the mean and variance of the untransformed response at various locations in design space. We then exploit a well-known probability inequality, along with our proposed moment estimator, to construct an approximate 100(1−α)% prediction interval on the original response, given settings of the design factors. We used Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed prediction interval estimator relative to 2 commonly used alternatives. Our results suggest the proposed method is often the better alternative when the sample size is small and/or when the underlying model is misspecified. We illustrate the application of our new method by applying it to a real experimental data set obtained from the literature, where machine tool life was studied as a function of various machining parameters.

Innovation is viewed here as being either incremental or radical changes to the products (services) and processes (ways of delivering services) which are typical to the organisation (WaSCs). Product and process innovations may involve changes to some or all of technologies, organisational structure and processes, behaviour and culture, and knowledge and skills within the organisation and its supply chain. This paper sets out to provide an understanding of the factors which both enable and constrain the development and adoption of infrastructure investment process innovations in the context of water utilities concerned with water and sewerage service delivery. The paper documents the process and results from an inductive research programme of participatory action research undertaken within a large, privately owned UK WaSC to facilitate infrastructure investment process innovation. Employee narratives during the innovation process from initiation to adoption decision-making were characterised and analysed. The findings suggest that the development and adoption of asset investment process innovations tends to be skewed in favour of opportunities which align with (i) UK and European Union legislative and regulatory drivers; (ii) WaSC mission policy and goals; (iii) innovation cost advantages over a prescribed period of time; (iv) perceived risks to service provision associated with the introduction of the innovation, and; (v) the extent to which the organisational processes and cultures which act to increase the absorptive capacity of the WaSC to the proposed innovation are already functioning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"Computer supported cooperative work; Decision making; Innovation; Sewers; Supply chains; Absorptive capacity; Infrastructure investment; Innovation process; Organisational structure; Participatory action research; Performance outcome; Regulatory drivers; Research programmes; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002556863

However the high rate of growth, over the years of the financial turmoil as well, may have paradoxically prevented the improvement of governance indexes, meanwhile financial sector and global governance issues will have to be improved in order to promote efficient financial intermediation and sustainable growth in China.

Background Technology has become a primary driver for all business operations, which has dramatically transformed the wireless communications marketing paradigm. However, researchers have claimed that further inquiry is still needed to ex-plore the role that distinct and emerging global technologies have on marketing communication strategies. This study explores the linkage of mobile and email marketing on consumers' impulse buying behavior in Pakistan. Methodology Primary data were collected through the distribution of 1000 questionnaires among students of different universities within two provinces of Pakistan: Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The study was conducted between November 2016 and March 2017. The authors received back 950 surveys, which is a very significant rate of return (95%). Of those submitted, 900 sur-veys were deemed eligible for analysis after improper documents were elimi-nated. Structure equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to test the study's hy-potheses. Contribution This study assists organizations in improving marketing campaigns by focusing more on mobile devices (m-devices) and email medium to better comprehend consumers' assessment processes at a lower budgetary cost. Such digital con-siderations could provide innovative possibilities for marketers in approaching their target market by adopting novel methods for information sharing. Findings The findings revealed a positive association between mobile and email market-ing on consumers' impulse buying tendencies. The comprehensive analysis af-firmed; however, there is a higher positive relationship of mobile marketing results compared to email marketing outcomes. There are favorable benefits in considering such emerging methods in marketing communications as promo-Tional strategies are considered by organizations. Recommendations for practitioners Marketers are encouraged to evaluate the potential of using both emerging mediums to take advantage of consumer impulse buying habits where m-devices and emails approaches are utilized. Future Research Future inquiries might examine the global influence of m-devices and email technology toward other buying tendencies of consumers: exploratory, online, variety seeking, habitual, and other emerging complex on-demand buying be-havior. © 2018 Informing Science Institute.

Significant correlations to farm profitability for four of the 53 measures were found. Almost 40% of the variation in farm profitability was predicted by a simple linear model with just three of these personality measures: 'Detail Conscious' and 'Leadership' measures positively and, 'Relaxed', negatively, predicted farm profitability. Though observational, and not demonstrating cause and effect, the associations are strong. These three measures are, thus, candidate variables for personality measures that drive farmer and farm manager performance. Longitudinal, or intervention studies, may demonstrate causality in the future. In the interim, being cognisant of these attributes during the hiring and training of farm staff, particularly those with management roles, may well result in improvements in farm profitability. © 2018 International Farm Management Association and Institute of Agricultural Management.","Farm profitability; Farmer personality; Management; Performance; Psychology; Talent",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064052257

When modeling how communication can be improved in these circumstances, previous studies have often relied on social network analysis to understand the aggregate exchanges among team members. In this study, rather than analyze social networks (people linked by communication), we argue that network analysis of knowledge networks (people linked by common knowledge) presents an opportunity to better understand and address the challenge of knowledge integration in organizational contexts. Research questions: 1. How can professional communicators use the distribution of knowledge on teams as a structure for planning interventions in the work of complex, collaborative teams? 2. What kinds of insights do networks of specific knowledge areas offer professional communicators about team communication challenges? Literature review: We describe prior uses of network analysis in professional communication research that inform our development of a knowledge network. In particular, we review current literature and highlight network-based concepts that we believe are organizing principles of knowledge networks. Previous literature has shown that network models, particularly social network models, are useful tools for professional communication researchers to examine a range of communication factors and practices. However, professional communication research has yet to fully explore the possible contributions of knowledge networks to understand communication processes. Methodology: We conducted an ethnography of a team science collaboration and used observations to create a survey of terms that measured subjects' self-professed understanding of key concepts. We used the survey results to produce a bimodal network model of agents and terms, in which we binarized link values after filtering for only the highest-rated terms for each subject. Results: The model demonstrated that the team collaboration broke into two distinct groupings. Ego networks extracted from this parent network showed that concepts commonly well-understood in the team join together multiple subgroups of expert knowledge. Conclusions: The knowledge network is a useful instrument in helping team members understand possibilities for integrating knowledge across disciplines and subspecialties. The visual produced by this model also can be useful for developing research questions and strategizing work processes. © 2018 IEEE.","Mixed methods; networks; organizational knowledge; team science","Analytical models; Distributed computer systems; Engineering research; Flow visualization; Knowledge engineering; Networks (circuits); Professional aspects; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Communication process; Knowledge integration; Mixed method; Organizational context; Organizational knowledge; Professional communication; Social network services; team science; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055051504

The technology in question is a small, portable palm oil expeller invented in Cameroon in the 1980 s. The technology was designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and create employment opportunities by increasing local capacity for small-scale palm oil processing. The expeller was subsequently promoted in Benin and Liberia over a period of nearly two decades. This evaluation is based on archival research of institutional records, data from impact surveys of technology users in all three countries during the project periods, and field research in Liberia in 2011 and 2013. The study analyzes and evaluates the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the expeller over the long term, comparatively, across a broad geographic area. In terms of social and economic impacts, the technology consistently increased incomes for farmers and small enterprises. The use of the technology altered relationships of production, particularly with regard to the role of women in palm oil processing and their control over resources. Environmental impacts of the technology are geographically dispersed and include increased water usage and pollution. Ultimately the technology in question has also contributed to political impacts over time by exacerbating conflicts between small farmers, palm oil corporations, and governments. This study confirms that comparative, longitudinal evaluation research can reveal important dimensions of development impacts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Evaluation; Impacts; Palm oil; Sustainability; Technology","agricultural worker; development project; economic impact; environmental impact; machinery; productivity; social conflict; sustainability; technology diffusion; vegetable oil; Benin [West Africa]; Cameroon; Liberia [West Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052620934

The results failed to show a connection between innovation and firm performance in the 2010 and 2016 periods. One implication from the 2010 and 2016 results is that standard product and process improvements may not be enough to achieve benefits in 2010 and 2016, because manufacturers may be having difficulty appropriating profits from these innovation practices in today’s globally competitive climate. The results suggest a need for more nuanced measurement of innovation in associating it with business outcomes. © The Author(s) 2018.","community innovation survey; innovation; manufacturing survey; profitability","competitiveness; industrial competition; industrial performance; innovation; manufacturing; profitability; technological development; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056745762

To develop robust solutions in the presence of estimation errors, we then present a stochastic optimization model that handles uncertainties in breach probability estimations.

This article fills the gap by providing empirical evidence from China on the fuel intensity-performance link at the firm level. Our findings are summarized as follows: (i) firms’ fuel intensity significantly constrains the firms’ profitability and the constraint effect is significantly greater for firms with no access to finance; (ii) an increase in fuel intensity reduces profitability by intensifying the financial constraint effect; and (iii) financial access moderates the constraint effect of fuel intensity on firm’s performance.

Decision-making regarding the choice of security countermeasures has to take into consideration a multitude of, often conflicting, functional and non-functional system goals. Therefore, a structured method to support crucial security decisions during a system’s design that can take account of risk whilst providing feedback on the optimal decisions within specific scenarios would be valuable. Design/methodology/approach: Secure Tropos is a well-established security requirements engineering methodology, but it has no concepts of Risk, whilst Constrained Goal Models are an existing method to support relevant automated reasoning tasks. Hence we bridge these methods, by extending Secure Tropos to incorporate the concept of Risk, so that the elicitation and analysis of security requirements can be complimented by a systematic risk assessment process during a system’s design time and supporting the reasoning regarding the selection of optimal security configurations with respect to multiple system objectives and constraints, via constrained goal models. Findings: As a means of conceptual evaluation, to give an idea of the applicability of the approach and to check if alterations may be desirable, a case study of its application to an e-government information system is presented. The proposed approach is able to generate security mechanism configurations for multiple optimisation scenarios that are provided, whilst there are limitations in terms of a natural trade-off of information levels of risk assessment that are required to be elicited. Originality/value: The proposed approach adds additional value via its flexibility in permitting the consideration of different optimisation scenarios by prioritising different system goals and the automated reasoning support. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Constraint goal models; Decision making; Information security; Secure Tropos; Security requirements","Bridges; Cryptography; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Government data processing; Information systems; Information use; Risk perception; Security of data; Complex information systems; Design/methodology/approach; Goal models; Secure tropos; Security configurations; Security countermeasures; Security requirements; Security requirements engineering; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056906299

The six factors examined in this study are product complexity, product specificity, the number of partners, relationship duration, dependence disadvantage and dependence advantage. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was designed to collect data from Mainland China with 206 valid data received. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses proposed. Findings: The differences in the results show that product specificity and dependence disadvantage are significant determinants of eSCM adoption for buyers’ perspective, but not from that of suppliers. In addition, product complexity and dependence advantage (although negatively associated with eSCM adoption) are significant for suppliers, but not for buyers. Number of partners and relationship duration are significant determinants from both perspectives. Originality/value: This research contributes to understanding on how the factors embedded in an exchange structure influence the adoption of eSCM from the angles of both the buyers and suppliers.

Stackelberg games are applied to obtain the optimal equilibrium solutions to the two models. Our analysis indicates that although the manufacturer can always obtain more profit through his own dual channels than through a retailer's dual channels, the retailer dual-channel model can capture the online market better than the manufacturer dual-channel model. Furthermore, we find that the manufacturer's ability to control the channels will greatly influence the online entry of the retailer. We present the conditions under which the profits of the manufacturer (or the retailer) will be enhanced (or worsened) in these two dual-channel models. Finally, we extend the models in two directions. First, we generalize the models to a situation in which both the manufacturer and the retailer open e-channels simultaneously. Second, we extend the models to include cases where the online discount rate is treated as a decision variable. Analytical results from the extended models are then discussed and interpreted. © The authors 2017.","Channel selection policy; Stackelberg game; Supply chain management","Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Analytical results; Channel selection; Decision variables; Equilibrium solutions; Selection policies; Single channels; Stackelberg Games; Unified framework; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055430346

The first scenario is a standard wind power investment, where the investor rents the land from local farms. In the second scenario, the wind power investor buys the land and commercializes both electricity and crop production, thus reducing the revenue risk through the diversification. Both scenarios have a waiting option, with the wholesale prices leading the installation decision. We model the electricity price as a mean reverting process with jumps and with different jumping probabilities for the different seasons of the year. Corn prices follow a mean reverting process. The waiting flexibility was modeled as a bundle of European options. The results indicate that the waiting option is exercised in 100% of our simulations in both scenarios, suggesting the still important role of government policies to stimulate wind power. More importantly, in more than 90% of the simulations, the second scenario brought value to the investment. Furthermore, net present values are more sensitive to reductions in capital costs than electricity prices. These results can form the basis for more effective policies for the wind power sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Corn; Investment decision; Real option framework; Wind energy","Costs; Cultivation; Economics; Risk perception; Wind power; Agricultural productions; Corn; Investment decisions; Potential efficiency; Real Options; Real options frameworks; Wind power investments; Wind power projects; Investments; comparative study; crop production; electricity supply; energy policy; investment; maize; wind power; Ohio; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049353634

In this paper, we explore how the concepts and applications of the efficiency performance measurement paradigm can be used to inform enterprise design. Up to date, efficiency performance measurement has been mainly used to describe how well an enterprise has performed, i.e., answering 'what happened' via an ex post evaluation. However, informing enterprises on 'what might happen' when making changes, i.e., an ex ante evaluation, has received less attention. To address this gap, we synthetize findings pertaining to enterprise design from the organizational design, enterprise systems engineering, and efficiency performance measurement literatures. The synthesis allows us to identify the integrative role that the efficiency performance measurement paradigm plays in informing enterprise transformation decisions. We illustrate this role by providing a case study of an enterprise dealing with design decisions. Our research provides exploratory evidence, for managerial stakeholders, about the ability of the efficiency performance measurement paradigm to answer how well an enterprise could perform if certain design decisions are made. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Efficiency performance measurement; enterprise design; enterprise systems engineering","Computer architecture; Computer testing; Design; Efficiency; Mathematical models; Measurement; Models; Societies and institutions; Systems engineering; Benchmark testing; Enterprise design; Enterprise transformation; Enterprise-systems engineering; Ex-post evaluations; Operational strategies; Organizational designs; Performance measurements; Benchmarking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042114934

To explore this, we use the common example of a wholesaler operating in an environment where suppliers demonstrate heterogeneous reliability. The wholesaler has partial orders with dual suppliers and uses lateral transshipments. While supplier reliability is a key concern in inventory management, reliable suppliers are more expensive and investment in strategic approaches that improve supplier performance carries a high cost. Here we consider the operational strategy of dual sourcing with reliable and unreliable suppliers and model the total inventory cost where the likely scenario lead-time of the unreliable suppliers extends beyond the scheduling period.

Design/methodology/approach: Using an online survey, the author triangulates the cross-sectional measurement of the effects of academic and clinicians’ social position in the initial and later phases of CLAHRCs with the longitudinal measurement of these effects over a two-year period. Findings: First, academics and clinicians with a higher personal professional status are more likely to develop joint networks and decision making both in the early and later phases of a CLAHRC. Second, academics and clinicians who are more connected to higher status occupational peers are more likely to develop joint networks in the early phase of a knowledge exchange partnership but are less likely to become engaged in joint networks over time. Third, involvement of knowledge brokers in the networks of academics and clinicians is likely to facilitate their inter-professional networking only in the later partnership phase. Practical implications: Academics and clinicians’ capitals have a distinctive influence on knowledge exchange in the early and later phases of CLAHRCs and on a change in knowledge exchange over a two-year period. Originality/value: Prior research on CLAHRCs has examined how knowledge exchange between academics and clinicians can be encouraged by the creation of shared governance mechanisms.

However, given the vast number of candidate function attributes to select from, there is a fundamental challenge when searching for the appropriate function attributes to include in next-generation products. This work quantifies the semantic similarities between descriptive design requirements and function attributes in order to identify new function attributes that have the highest similarity to each requirement. This work hypothesizes that there is a correlation between these new function attributes and increased product sales. The case study presented in this work tests this hypothesis in the mechanical transmission systems domain. This work analyzes the impacts of products that contain different function attributes on actual product sales in the market. Transmission system function attributes and product sales data, including new electronic gear shifting systems from Shimano's bicycle division, are introduced in the case study.

In line with our predictions, we find clustering of patent filings around month-ends, with month-end applications being more complex than those filed on other days. Consistent with time pressure reducing work quality, we find that work quality is lower for tasks completed at month-ends, more so for process measures of quality than for outcome measures.

The forecasts are averaged using six different weighting functions including Simple Model Averaging (SMA), Granger-Ramanathan Model Averaging (GRMA), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Smoothing Akaike (SAIC), Mallows Weights (MMA) and Jackknife (JMA). Our results show that model averaging gives always a lower Mean Square Forecast Error (MSFE) than the best/optimal models within each class however selected. For example, for Coal, Wind and Hydro generated Electricity forecasts generated with model averaging, we report a MSFE about 12% lower than that obtained using the best selected individual models. Among these, the best individual forecasting models are the Non-Linear Artificial Neural Networks and the Vector Autoregression and that models selected by the Jackknife have often superior performance.

In addition, other dynamic requirements also have likely led to changes in their leadership characteristics. The most important relationship a dean has is with the chairs, yet in the context of the dean’s changing role, little attention has been paid to this relationship. To frame this discussion, we asked medical school chairs what characteristics of a dean’s leadership were most beneficial. We distributed a 26-question survey to 885 clinical and basic science chairs at 41 medical schools. These chairs were confidentially surveyed on their views of six leadership areas: evaluation, barriers to productivity, communication, accountability, crisis management, and organizational values. Of the 491 chairs who responded (response rate =55%), 88% thought that their dean was effective at leading the organization, and 89% enjoyed working with their dean. Chairs indicated that the most important area of expertise of a dean is to define a strategic vision, and the most important value for a dean is integrity between words and deeds. Explaining the reasons behind decisions, providing good feedback, admitting errors, open discussion of complex or awkward topics, and skill in improving relations with the teaching hospital were judged as desirable attributes of a dean. Interestingly, only 23% of chairs want to be a dean in the future. Financial acumen was the least important skill a chair thought a dean should hold, which is in contrast to the skill set for which many deans are hired and evaluated. After reviewing the literature and analyzing these responses, we assert that medical school chairs want their dean to maintain more traditional leadership than that needed by a health care system executive, such as articulating a vision for the future and keeping their promises. Thus, there appears to be a mismatch between what medical school chairs perceive they need from their dean and how the success of a dean is evaluated. © 2018 Hromas et al.","Academic medicine deans; Leadership characteristics; Organizational values","article; attention; clinician; error; health care system; human; leadership; medical school; productivity; skill; teaching hospital; vision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060367997

Backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models are employed in four kinds of urban traffic environments to test whether the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy of traffic flow. The results show that prediction models using traffic data after dimension reduction outperform the same prediction models using other datasets. The proposed method provides an alternative to existing models for urban traffic prediction. © 2018 Yi Zhao et al.",,"Forecasting; Linear regression; Motor transportation; Neural networks; Roads and streets; Street traffic control; Back-propagation neural networks; Correlation coefficient; Data dimension reduction; Multi-dimensional scaling; Multiple linear regression models; Qualitative analysis; Short-term traffic flow; Urban road networks; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058316636

This paper adopts an output-oriented version of DEA based on financial ratios where inputs are not utilised. In order to handle missing data, we test and compare two different techniques: the deletion one and the multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA). We find that DEA can be a complement or alternative tool to ratio analysis to evaluate corporates' performance. We also find that the most efficient shipbuilders are those based in the most prosperous countries. Finally, the MLRA efficiency scores are more reliable and consistent with the firms' annual reports and financial ratios.

These banks offer non-traditional finance items, presumably to compete with these financial institutions. This study aims to examine the importance of accounting for off-balance sheet (OBS) items when estimating the financial performance of community banks. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies a two-stage analysis pathway that initially calculates X-efficiency scores as part of the overall cost structure and then deploys data envelopment analysis bootstrapping method for a second-stage ordinary least square model. Findings: Study findings indicate that failure to include OBS items in the X-efficiency calculation for community banks understates the efficiency performance of these banks. Furthermore, results indicate that factors internal and external to the community bank affect X-efficiency. Increases in OBS items are associated with growth in assets and growth in net non-interest income. Therefore, OBS items become an attractive alternative source of income and a mechanism for expanding output with the same volume of inputs. In addition, OBS items allow the largest community banks to deleverage their balance sheet, whereas the smallest community banks still emphasize on traditional lending products and benefit from existing equity. Also, larger banks may be using OBS items as a mechanism to isolate their performance from macroeconomic fluctuations. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations include a reduced number of community banks as consolidation accelerates partly because of compliance concerns. Practical implications: The approach used supports a series of community bank managerial approaches that may be adopted by management. Originality/value: The results of this study show several reasons why community banks may have managerial incentives to include OBS items. As observed by Gilbert et al. (2013), community banks are adjusting their product line so as to operate efficiently. Community banks must provide a product line which provides margin and meets customer needs at a profit to the firm. OBS items allow existing staff to provide funds without additional equity requirements from the balance sheets. The increase in OBS activities may signal the perception that the associated interest income is less risky and less costly than other alternatives, including adopting technologies to diversify traditional loan product offerings. As community banks tend to have lower default rates than their larger counterparts, the most likely explanation is that the OBS interest risk is more attractive than compliance or development of mechanisms to offer a broader suite of traditional loan products. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Community bank; DEA; Efficiency; Off-balance sheet; Product mix; Two-stage analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044817910

In this article, we explore the effect of state-level CNC enforceability on firm productivity. We assert that an increase in state level CNC enforceability is detrimental to firm productivity, and this relationship becomes stronger as comparable job opportunities become more concentrated in a firm's home state. On the other hand, this negative relationship is weakened as employee compensation tends to become more long-term oriented.

Specifically, we explore how the decision to reveal dual-career status in the academic job search process impacts faculty members’ later promotions, productivity, pay, mobility, and career-related goals. We draw on a sample of roughly 230 faculty in seven US universities who were part of a dual-career couple at their time of hire. We find that risk-taking during the job search impacts some career outcomes, and does so similarly for women and men. Members of a dual-career couple who took the risk of revealing their dual-career status before a job offer reported significantly more positive career experiences related to promotion and productivity than those who did not reveal their status during the job search. Only the salary outcome was negatively related to revealing dual-career status in the job search process. Because of the nature of academic hiring, revealing a risky status during the job search process may ameliorate barriers to employment.

Access to external knowledge and resources is widely believed to improve innovation performance. Yet, involvement of supply network partners during product development does not always prove to be beneficial. This study identifies contextual factors that influence the value of the information and resources obtained from the supply network when the primary goal is the level of product innovativeness. The contextual factors discussed in this paper include the extent of formal internal coordination within the focal development firm, and two external factors, competitive intensity and technological turbulence in the product market. The data comes from a survey of manufacturing firms in business-to-business (B2B) settings. The results indicate that technological turbulence strengthens the effect of supplier and customer involvement on product innovation. However, under high competitive intensity, only supplier involvement is associated with product innovation. Under both high competitive intensity and high internal coordination, customer information gathering is positively associated with product innovation, but customer involvement is not. We present the managerial implications of these findings and recommendations on how to adapt the firm's innovation strategy. © 2018 IEEE.","external integration; internal coordination; Product innovation; uncertainty","Turbulence; Business to business; Innovation performance; Internal coordination; Managerial implications; Product innovation; Product innovativeness; Technological turbulences; uncertainty; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057780907

We examine acquisition timing decisions for three types of resources: Material resources, facilities and equipment resources, and human resources. Two venture milestones are examined: Accomplishment of the first sale and achievement of positive cash flows. We theorize that resource acquisition timing can impact the degree of resource availability delays and the rate of resource-driven cash outflows/inflows, which, in turn, determine the time to first sale and the time to positive cash flows, respectively. Our results demonstrate that decisions concerning resource acquisition timing could have contradictory effects vis-à-vis shortening the time to first sale versus shortening the time to positive cash flows. These findings highlight the difficult tradeoffs that ventures have to navigate when making resource acquisition decisions, which have implications for multiple milestones across a venture's lifecycle. Finally, the paper demonstrates how technological novelty moderates, and, in fact, radically alters, the relationship between the timing of resource acquisitions and the time to venture milestone achievement. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Entrepreneurship; first sale; lean start-up; profitability; resources; scale-up; venture lifecycle","Acceleration; Life cycle; Profitability; Timing circuits; Delays; Entrepreneurship; Resource management; resources; Scale-up; Mergers and acquisitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052662358

Such industry condition can easily generate a high profile in production and sales. However, achieving sustainability in the long run using automation and purchase of the patent only seems unsuitable. In the last two decades, it is found that both the medium and big size companies have leaned on introducing automation in their existing product plants, improving them in nothing but production. The article measures technical efficiency using data envelopment analysis (DEA) over the period of 2009–2013. We use one output—annual sales—and three inputs, namely, (a) fixed asset, (b) raw material cost and (c) cost of salary to run Malmquist total factor productivity (TFP) index. The major contributor of TFP growth is found due to the technological positive growth with a value of 10.8 per cent annually. Moreover, all changes of technical efficiency, pure efficiency and scale efficiency have regressed with values of 5.5 per cent, 2.1 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. Thus, the gains in productivity are entirely due to technological advancements and not for technical improvements. The main source of inefficiency in pharmaceutical industry is scale inefficiency rather than pure technical inefficiency. Limitations and policy implications are addressed. © 2018, 2018 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Malmquist productivity index; pharmaceutical",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048038499

This unique context may have increased the challenges faced by governments at the local level through economic downturns such as the Great Recession. Given this concern, which has yet to be addressed in the literature, this article develops an open systems model of local government forecast accuracy, which can be tested across any type of local government. This article tests the model with a panel of special purpose governments at the local level, specifically school districts in Pennsylvania, from 2003 through 2013. Estimation of the model with longitudinal analysis shows that government forecasters at the local level consider internal and external factors when forecasting own-source and intergovernmental revenue streams. In particular, a mix of institutional, financial, and political factors are associated with forecast accuracy. Forecasters at the local level also considered the role of economic shocks, as evidenced by decreased expectations for own-source revenue through the Great Recession. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that they consider a complex and multifaceted information set, which includes both internal and external determinant factors of forecast accuracy at the local level. These factors can prove critical to increasing forecast accuracy in context of the financial uncertainty experienced through the Great Recession. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.","financial management; forecasting; strategic planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048293184

The recent literature in this area has recognized the positive impact of social ties on workforce productivity, motivating new re-formulations of conventional operations research problems to more explicitly consider team building. This paper inspects a different – negative – aspect of social tie formation. Indeed, such ties may enable the spread of negligent or corrupt behavior, presenting a hindrance to the productivity of larger businesses with limited capacity for workforce monitoring. Through model-based analyses, this paper quantitatively establishes the benefits of workforce rotation as a means to curb corruption, and presents rigorous investigations into rotation policy-making. To this end, the Link Based Corruption (LBC) model is introduced. The modeled agents are assumed to be embedded into a directed peer-to-peer monitoring network; e.g., employees working on the same task or in the same room can be viewed as being supervisors of each other. Corruption is taken to be a threat whenever an agent and their supervisor(s) are all corruption-prone (ready to go corrupt); once they identify each other as such, which takes time, a productivity loss takes place. Under the LBC model, this paper addresses the policy-maker's problem of fixing the agent monitoring structure and timing the workforce rotation so as to minimize the expected long-time loss. The impact of the LBC model parameters – the fraction of corruption-prone agents in the workforce, productivity rate, costs, rate of corrupt link formation, etc. – on the choice of an optimal policy is quantitatively assessed. It is also shown that the problem of inferring the LBC model parameters in real-world settings can be addressed by “feeling the system” i.e., observing what financial outputs a given business generates when operating under different policy settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corruption; Rotation policy; Social network analysis; Workforce management","employee; human; human experiment; management; model; monitoring; productivity; quantitative study; rotation; social network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026636069

These city pairs possessed very similar resource endowments and formal institutions prior to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but diverged dramatically afterward in their economic growth patterns. A detailed comparison of policy implementation reveals that distinct local informal institutions were a key source of their economic divergence.

We propose a multi-generation demand model that accounts for supply constraints. A mathematical model of the supply-restricted multi-generation diffusion problem is then developed and the optimal sales policy is derived. Closed-form analytical expressions as well as numerical experiments are used to investigate the effect of consumers’ backlogging, cost of production capacity, unit profit margin for the products, market expansion by the new generation, and cannibalization of older generations. Through consideration of supply restrictions and lost sales, we are able to generalize previous findings on market entry policy by showing that there is a continuous range of optimal introduction times. We show that the inter-dependence between production capacity and initial inventory varies based on the introduction time of the new generation. We also provide an application of the proposed model in the case of Sony's PlayStation®3 game console.

The results showed that the variables have long-run equilibrium relationship, being co-integrated, and possible errors in the short-run correct with a speed of 8.89% per annum. It was also indicated that significant long-run joint-causality flowed from the identified correlates to profitability. Strengthening the above point is the revelation that innovations or shocks to the identified variables produced varying effects on profitability. More particularly, in the short-run, significant causality flowed from size, risk (defined in terms of loss or claims\ratio), and growth in written premiums to profitability. These variables were found to causally and significantly relate with profitability. By implication, size, risk, and growth constitute the major determinants of insurance profitability in Nigeria. In contrast, there is no significant causality found flowing from liquidity, leverage, and tangibility to insurance profitability in Nigeria, in the short-run. Thus, they are not revealed to be the major determinants of profitability for the insurance companies studied, in view of their causal inferiority.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper first proposes a probability model to predict customers’ responses to firms’ marketing solicitations in which a customer’s inter-purchase times are assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, whose parameters vary across customers and follow a gamma distribution. The paper then proposes a customer profitability scoring model that uses customers’ responses as an input to assess their lifetime profitability at a given point of time. Findings: The paper illustrates the proposed method using individual-level purchasing data of 529 customers from a catalog firm. The paper shows that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark model in terms of both explaining and predicting customers’ purchases. The paper also demonstrates significant profit consequences to the firm if incorrect methods are used instead of the proposed method. Practical implications: The proposed method can help firms select or eliminate customers based on their lifetime profitability so that firms can focus their marketing efforts in a more targeted manner to increase total profits. Originality/value: The proposed Gamma-Poisson probability model and the profitability scoring method are easy to implement due to the attractive conjugacy property.

As positive outcomes in non-profit organisations are associated with quality relationships between organisations, the purpose of this article is to explore primary stakeholder perspectives of the governance of schoolboy football in the Republic of Ireland. The research questions to be addressed are: do tensions exist between stakeholders and does the FAI display effective governance behaviours in relation to its primary stakeholders. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven stakeholders from the football governance system. A lack of congruence across the system was identified, which resulted from ineffective stakeholder management (poor communication practices, perceptions of inaccurate disclosures, perceived lack of inclusion in decision-making, perceptions of organisational injustice, confusion over role clarity and responsibilities).

An understudied case is that of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), which recently have become the dominant provider of specific surgical procedures. While the majority of ASCs focus on a single specialty, a growing number are diversifying to offer a wide range of surgical services. We take a multiple output cost function approach to an empirical investigation that compares production economies in single specialty ASCs with those in multispecialty ASCs. We applied generalized estimating equation techniques to a sample of Pennsylvania ASCs for the period 2004–2014, including 73 ASCs that specialized in gastrointestinal procedures and 60 ASCs that performed gastrointestinal as well as other specialty procedures. Results indicated that both types of ASC had small room for expansion. In simulation analysis, production of GI services in specialized ASCs had a cost advantage over joint production of GI with other specialty procedures. Our results provide support for the focused factory model of production in the ASC sector. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ambulatory surgery centers; Cost; Specialization","ambulatory surgery; economic aspect; gastrointestinal tract; human; human tissue; joint; Pennsylvania; simulation; specialization; algorithm; ambulatory surgery; economics; organization and management; outpatient department; specialization; United States; utilization; Algorithms; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Efficiency, Organizational; Specialization; Surgicenters; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029151769

Two factors are considered in the choice of health plan with wellness: the effect of peer choices and family health on plan choice. Using exclusively obtained data of health insurance plan choice and utilization, this paper compares similar plans and focuses on a subsample of new employees. Result show that peers affect own choice of health insurance: a 10 percentage point rise in the share of colleagues enrolled in Aetna Wellness increases the probability of own enrollment in the plan by up to 3.9 percentage points. This result suggests that lack of experience with a wellness program are key to employee reluctance to enroll.

Remarkably, there have been few evaluations of either their economic impact or their prospects for economic impact. The 2004 decision by California voters to issue bonds to fund $3 billion of research on human pluripotent stem cells is an ideal case study for introducing an evaluation methodology for the progress by state programs in developing and transferring research results. In the process of evaluating the California stem cell initiative, we make three methodological contributions to the study of the impacts of sub-national science-based economic development programs. First, the following data sources are introduced as indicators of the prospective economic benefits of these programs: changes in targeted federal research funding, patenting, small business investment research grants, venture capital investment, new firm formations, and clinical trials. Second, the use of regional or industrial controls is introduced. In the case study of the California stem cell initiative the regional control is the comparison of the two dominant California stem cell research and firm clusters, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, to the other dominant cluster, Boston. The biotechnology industry, as a whole, is used to control for exogenous shocks such as changes in the overall interest in new life science technologies. Third, because technology transfer is predicated upon commercialization, a value chain perspective can visualize commercialization obstacles. In this study, a stylized human stem cell therapy value chain is compared to the existing biotechnology value chain and the differences suggest areas where human stem cell therapies are likely to face difficulties. The discussion and conclusion evaluates the progress of the California stem cell initiative and suggests that the evaluation methodology developed can improve the evaluation and guidance of science-based economic development programs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; Commercialization; Evaluation; Regenerative medicine; Research goal setting; Stem cells","Biotechnology; Cells; Chains; Cytology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Investments; Technology transfer; California institute for regenerative medicines; Commercialization; Evaluation; Regenerative medicine; Research goals; Stem cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018457607

The non-parametric approach of MPI-DEA examined the productivity, technological and efficiency change indices. Findings - The result suggested both Islamic and conventional REITs have exhibited productivity regress of 18.09% and 11.51% respectively during the period of study. These productivity regress could mainly due to the regress in technological rather than efficiency change. One possible reason for this technological regress is likely due to REIT requirement in which the REIT managers could not retain their earning and reinvest their income for the following year. The REIT managers need to have access to external capital for purchasing new asset, which could lead to a higher cost of capital than the retained earnings. On the other hand, both conventional and Islamic REITs exhibited an increase of 28.33% and 61.54% respectively for efficiency change, mainly due to an increase in managerial rather than scale, implying that both REITs have been managerially efficient in managing the operating costs but operating at the non-optimum scale of operations. Research limitations/implications -This study provide empirical evidence on the source of productivity regress for M-REITs and insights on the comparative analysis of Islamic and conventional REITs.

Online product sampling affords the advantages of reaching mass audiences, as well as opportunities for firms to select promising sample recipients. In this study, we leverage on the data from an online platform's early effort in administering online product sampling campaigns, whereby sample recipients were randomly selected from among the consumers who indicated interest in the product sample. This affords a relatively “clean” environment for us to investigate the behaviors of consumers in terms of their subsequent purchase-making after being given a product sample, with minimal biases arising from purposive selection issues. We find that, overall, receiving a product sample could increase the consumers' purchase probability by around 300%. Furthermore, the effects vary among different type of consumers.

This article extends a variant of the asymmetric preference model suggested by Ruge-Murcia to investigate the use of real-time data available to policymakers when making their decisions and revised data which more accurately measure economic performance, but is only available much later. In our extended model, the central banker targets a weighted average of revised and real-time inflation together with a weighted average of revised and real-time output. Moreover, we allow for an asymmetric central bank response to real-time data depending on whether the unemployment rate is high or low. Our model identifies several new potential sources of inflation bias due to data revisions. Our empirical results suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank focuses on targeting revised inflation during low unemployment periods, but it weighs heavily real-time inflation during high unemployment periods. The inflation bias due to data revisions is comparable in magnitude to the bias from asymmetric central banker preferences with the bias being somewhat larger during high unemployment. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","asymmetric preferences; data revisions; inflation bias; Monetary policy targets; real-time data","banking; decision making; inflation; monetary policy; preference behavior; real time; unemployment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049805511

Recently retailers in the online book industry started bundling programs such as Amazon Matchbook, giving print book buyers a free or deeply discounted e-book version. While this bundling strategy is attractive to consumers, it potentially allows consumers to resell the print book in the bundle, which might cannibalize retailers' sales. Consequently, it will influence all participants in the industry including the publisher, the retailers, and the consumers. Using a two-period model, the authors investigate the impacts of this strategy under both monopoly and competition. The authors compute the equilibrium outcome for both scenarios. The findings show that (1) under monopoly, both the publisher and the retailer sell at a higher rate; consumers also see higher total surplus; (2) under competition, the retailer who provides bundling will gain a competitive advantage.

Customers arrive to station 1 according to a Poisson process, and a gatekeeper, who has complete knowledge of the number of customers at both stations, decides whether to accept or reject each arriving customer. If a customer is rejected, a rejection cost is incurred. If an admitted customer finds that station 2 is full at the time of his service completion at station 1, he leaves the system and a loss cost is incurred. The goal is to find easy-to-implement policies that minimize long-run average cost per unit time. We formulate two intuitive, extremal policies and provide analytical results on their performances. We also present necessary and/or sufficient conditions under which each of these policies is optimal. Next, we show that for some states of the system it is always optimal to admit new arrivals. We also fully characterize the optimal policy when the capacity of each station is two and discuss some characteristics of optimal policies in general. Finally, we design heuristic admission control policies using these insights.

Decision on patients’ LOS at hospital post-surgery affects overall healthcare performance as it affects both cost and quality of care. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for deriving the most appropriate LOS after surgical interventions. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts an action research involving multiple stakeholders (surgeon, patients/patients’ relatives, hospital management and other medics). First, a conceptual model is developed using literature and experts’ opinion. Second, the model is applied in three surgical interventions in a public hospital in Malta to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Third, the policy alternatives developed are compared to a selection of current international standards for each surgical intervention. The proposed model analyses three LOS threshold policies for three procedures using efficiency and responsiveness criteria. The entire analysis is carried out using 325 randomly selected patient files along with structured interactions with more than 50 stakeholders (surgeon, patients/patients’ relatives, hospital management and other medics). A multiple criteria decision-making method is deployed for model building and data analysis. The method involves combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for verbal subjective judgements on prioritizing the four predictors of surgical LOS—medical, financial, social and risk, with pairwise comparisons of the sub-criteria under each criterion in line with the concerned interventions—the objective data of which are obtained from the patients’ files. Findings: The proposed model was successfully applied to decide on the best policy alternative for LOS for the three interventions. The best policy alternatives compared well to current international benchmarks. Research limitations/implications: The proposed method needs to be tested for other interventions across various healthcare settings. Practical implications: Multi-criteria decision-making tools enable resource optimization and overall improvement of patient care through the application of a scientific management technique that involves all relevant stakeholders while utilizing both subjective judgements as well as objective data. Originality/value: Traditionally, the duration of post-surgery LOS is mainly based on the surgeons’ clinical but also arbitrary decisions, with, as a result, having insufficiently explicable variations in LOS amongst peers for similar interventions. According to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to derive post-surgery LOS using the AHP, a multiple criteria decision-making method. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytic hierarchy process; Hospital; Length of stay; Multi-criteria decision making; Multiple stakeholders","adult; article; controlled study; data analysis; decision making; female; hospital management; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; Malta; patient care; public hospital; randomized controlled trial (topic); relative; surgeon; surgery; decision support system; health care policy; hysterectomy; knee replacement; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; length of stay; postoperative care; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Hysterectomy; Length of Stay; Male; Malta; Postoperative Care; Surgical Procedures, Operative",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049152777

Human resources and claims system information were obtained from a single, large multistate employer through a third-party firm that extracted, merged, and deidentified the data for a final sample of 9,616 insured households. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate plan choice between a managed care preferred provider organization and two forms of CDHP. Andersen's Behavioral Model guided the cross-sectional, nonexperimental ex post facto design. Results indicate that cost sharing and health status have minimal effect on CDHP choice when operationalized as a continuous measure. However, a nonlinear association is suggested when examining the lowest and lower cost-sharing and health status groups. Enrollees in the lowest cost-sharing and best health status groups are most likely to choose a CDHP option offering a health savings account, while those in the lower cost-sharing and better health status groups are most likely to opt for a CDHP that includes a health reimbursement arrangement. This study supports the assessment that CDHPs benefit from favorable selection. Results also suggest that previously experienced cost sharing is a greater factor than health status when choosing a CDHP, particularly for those who are less healthy and who have experienced greater out-of-pocket spending. Employers should consider enrollees' experiences with healthcare plans, as these may influence plan choice and suggest features most important to employees, which can also influence healthcare-related behaviors. © 2018 Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives.",,"article; bank account; consumer; controlled study; employee; employer; health status; household; human; preferred provider organization; psychological model; reimbursement; retrospective study; adult; aged; comparative study; cross-sectional study; economics; female; health care cost; health insurance; male; middle aged; United States; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Benefit Plans, Employee; Health Expenditures; Health Status; Humans; Male; Managed Care Programs; Middle Aged; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050207497

Two special cases deliver classic outcomes under rational expectations: as the degree of low-frequency variation in beliefs goes to zero, the long-run inflation rate coincides with the inflation bias under optimal discretion; for non-zero low-frequency drift in beliefs, as households become highly patient valuing utility in any period equally, the optimal long-run inflation rate coincides with optimal commitment – price stability is optimal. The optimal state-contingent response to cost-push disturbances similarly reflects properties of optimal discretion and optimal commitment, depending on the degree of low-frequency variation in beliefs.

An increasingly popular efficiency benchmarking tool within agricultural research is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). However, the literature currently lacks sufficient demonstration of how DEA could be tuned to the needs of the farm advisor/extension officer, rather than of the researcher. Also, the literature is flooded with DEA terminology that may discourage the non-academic practitioner from adopting DEA. This paper aims at making DEA more accessible to farm consultants/extension officers by explaining the method step-by-step, visually and with minimal use of specialised terminology and mathematics. Then, DEA's potential for identifying cost-reducing and profit-making opportunities for farmers is demonstrated with a series of examples drawn from commercial UK dairy farm data. Finally, three DEA methods for studying efficiency change and trends over time are also presented. Main challenges are discussed (e.g. data availability), as well as ideas for extending DEA's applicability in the agricultural industry, such as the use of carbon footprints and other farm sustainability indicators in DEA analyses. © 2018 International Farm Management Association and Institute of Agricultural Management.","Benchmarking; Commercial dairy farms; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency; Farm management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059016059

Decades have passed and the inequality in compensation between minority and non-minority attorneys is still one of the most controversial issues in the legal profession. Based on human capital and labor discrimination theory, we examine the productivity and compensation differences between minority attorneys and non-minority counterparts. The sample consists of 554 firm-year observations of the 200 largest U.S law firms from 2013 to 2016. We use OLS with clustered standard errors by year. We find minority partners are more likely to provide relatively routine and template-based services, which do not command fee premium, which results in low productivity of minority partners. We find that minority partners are compensated less than their non-minority counterparts after controlling for productivity. This paper aids in the understanding of diversity in the workplace and the effect of diversity on a firms’ productivity and the type of services to provide. Also, this paper has implications on the compensation gap between minorities and their non-minority counterparts. © Business & Professional Ethics Journal.","Compensation disparity; Human capital theory; Labor discrimination theory; Law firms; Productivity; Profitability ratio analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058010135

Each agent has a randomly drawn productivity with respect to each type of agent on the other side. The value generated from a match between a pair of agents is the sum of the two productivity terms, each of which depends only on the type (but not the identity) of one of the agents, and a third deterministic term driven by the pair of types. We prove, under reasonable assumptions, that when the number of agent types is kept fixed, the relative size of the core vanishes rapidly as the number of agents grows. Numerical experiments confirm that the core is typically small. Our results provide justification for the typical assumption of a unique core outcome in such markets, which is close to a limit point.

Assuming that the consumer's future utility for each product alternative can be characterized by a standard random utility model, we use dynamic programming to determine the optimal consumption policy and the maximum expected value of consuming any n substitutable products selected while shopping (an n-pack). We propose two models. In the first (canonical) model, we assume that an alternative is consumed on each successive consumption occasion and obtain a closed-form optimal policy and a closed-form value function. Given a consumer's preferences for the product alternatives in an assortment, we then show how to identify that consumer's optimal n-pack using a simple swapping algorithm that converges in at most n swaps. In the second (generalized) model, we introduce an outside option so that a product alternative need not be consumed on each consumption occasion. We obtain a closed-form value function for the generalized model and show that its optimal n-pack is related to that of the canonical model using a special type of majorization. Additional structural properties and implications of each model are explored, as are other applications. © 2017 INFORMS.","Assortment optimization; Decision analysis; Dynamic programming; Multinomial logit; Utility/preference applications","Decision theory; Management; Operations research; Assortment optimization; Consumer's preferences; Multinomial Logit; Optimal consumption; Random utility model; Substitutable products; Swapping algorithms; Utility/preference; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047175974

In our study, we conducted a lab experiment to examine the effect of prediscussion note-taking on this phenomenon. The experiment used a murder-mystery hidden profile task. In all, 192 undergraduate students were recruited and randomly assigned into 48 four-person groups with gender being the matching variable (i.e., each group consisted of four same-gender participants). During the decision-making processes, some groups were asked to take notes while reading task materials and had their notes available in the following group discussion, while the other groups were not given this opportunity. Our analysis results suggest that (a) the presence of an information piece in group members' notes positively correlates with its appearance in the subsequent discussion and note-taking positively affects the group's information repetition rate; (b) group decision quality positively correlates with the group's information sampling rate and negatively correlates with the group's information sampling/repetition bias; and (c) gender has no statistically significant moderating effect on the relationship between note-taking and information sharing.

Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a case study of a collaboration with a global acting automotive Tier 1 supplier, who produces steering systems for cars and commercial vehicles. A total of 116 different variants of three components of a car automotive steering system were analysed and evaluated. The data were gathered from 13 sub-suppliers for three different types of a steering system. Findings: Unnecessary time, money, quality and technology can be saved through a greater understanding of such product variances. The results of the case study lead to a general method to optimise existing product variance and present cost improvements and a new key performance indicator to manage product variance out of the purchasing department. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on a purchasing case study at a Tier 1 supplier of the automotive branch. The approach can be used for other company departments, e.g. logistics and for different industries than automotive. Practical implications: A company can be successful and competitive when it meets the customer needs with a maximum on satisfaction without generating of waste. Unnecessary existing product variance is a kind of waste. The insights of this paper support the operative user and the strategic company management to reduce and improve unnecessary variance in different sections. Originality/value: The structured analysis of product variance from the purchasing perspective and the key performance indicator “variance share” are new to company management. The research focuses on the management of existing variance out of the purchasing department which is a segment that has received limited academic attention in research to date. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Product strategy; Purchasing; Variance","Automotive industry; Benchmarking; Commercial vehicles; Customer satisfaction; Purchasing; Sales; Automotive steering systems; Complexity; Design/methodology/approach; Key performance indicators; Product strategy; Purchasing department; Structured analysis; Variance; Automobile steering equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040789409

The chances of winning are amplified if one's choice matches the likelihood of the panel's choice. In this era of financialization, where profit-making has shifted to speculative sways rather than fundamental trade and commodity production measures (Krippner, Socio-Econ Rev 3(2):173-208, 2005), similar beauty contests have become even more acute. Online, real-time media channels along with pervasive investments applications have ushered in unprecedented online financial information and retail investor interest, ranging from dealing in penny stocks to sentiment-based trading. More than information sources, similar investment sites compete to recommend investment directions and strategies, not driven by strict fundamentals used by ""arbitrageurs"" or rational speculators but on pseudo-signals proffered by various information investment channels with varying degrees of credibility. This behavior, referred to herein as information activism, concomitantly adds a sociopsychological dimension to the concept of financialization (Lagoarde-Segot, Int Rev Financial Anal 2016)-wherein technology-driven information reach and range contribute to financial dominance of financial actors and practices. Using information activism as a lens, this research empirically evidences the extent to which information activism affects retail investor behavior under various market conditions. This study examines the differential effects of two primary, albeit reputable, sources of information activism: an investment news channel (CNBC-Mad Money) and an online financial blog (SeekingAlpha), and the effect on investor behavior during the 2008 financial crisis. In identifying the specific downstream effects of information activism on capital markets and investor behavior, factors related to investor behavior, such as trading volume and price reaction, are analyzed surrounding information activism events. Results indicate that retail investors appear to rely on online information activists during uncertain economic conditions.

The study outcomes show that the key drivers were unnecessary diagnostic procedures such as imaging tests, large numbers of specialty referrals, and hospitalization. The author observed that adoption of patient-centered care results in a significant reduction in hospitalization, unnecessary procedures, and specialty visits. The findings also indicate that an emphasis on primary care reduces hospitalization, unnecessary procedures, and visits to specialists. Further, organizational restructuring had a significant impact on reducing unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The study outcomes suggest that healthcare leaders should promote the active participation of patients in care delivery. Leaders also should develop strategies that enhance primary care as a means of reducing hospitalization and the need for specialty referrals.

It aims to identify what elements have an impact on board independence and examine how these influence the independence of independent directors. Four elements, independence from management; dependence on shareholders; access to information; and incentive to monitor, may have a substantial influence on board independence and align with the in-fact independence of independent directors. This article examines how and why these four elements have an impact on the effectiveness of the role of independent directors in monitoring top management and lead to independent directors failing to be truly independent of management. To support this argument, this article also investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of independent directors serving as a governance mechanism in terms of board independence in Chinese listed companies. The aim was therefore to scrutinise whether independent directors in Chinese listed companies are truly independent from management. Based on statistics calculated on data collected from CSMAR, there appears to be little evidence that independent directors serve as a governance mechanism in monitoring top management in Chinese listed companies, which thus shows that independent directors are not independent in China. The implications arising from this article are that solutions addressing the four elements that have an impact on board independence will enable independent directors to become truly independent. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","board independence; effectiveness; efficiency; managerial hegemony; monitoring",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117506580

The extensively used factor model proposed initially by Sharpe in 1963 has provided a robust backdrop for development of relevant, micro, macro, and context-specific or asset specific explanatory variables to be incorporated in a statistical manner as inputs to forecasting models that can then be used to obtain risk measures upon which portfolio allocations are based. However, like all statistical models, a set of statistical assumptions accompany this factor model regression framework, one of which has recently been highlighted as seemingly nonvalidated in financial data. This is, of course, the assumption such factor models make on homoskedasticity or weak-sense covariance stationarity of the returns processes being modeled. Such factor models, therefore, have typically failed to cope with an important and ubiquitous feature of financial assets data, which often demonstrates heteroskedasticity of the returns variances and covariances. We propose a novel generalized multifactor forecasting structure utilizing a covariance regression model, which allows us to incorporate the required heteroskedasticity effects while also admitting potential dependence in the idiosyncratic error terms. We argue that such a modeling approach allows for more explicit relationships to be interpreted between the driving factors and the conditional responses of the portfolio returns. We then compare the forecasting performances of our model with the multifactor model and the time series dynamic conditional correlation model through a currency portfolio application.

This study provides preliminary answers to that question using a natural experiment underway at the Department of Energy (DOE): a leader with significant high-level management experience superior to that of his predecessors, but no relevant technical experience was appointed to run the vast scientific research operation. The following hypothesis is proposed: A major risk of allowing technically-unqualified leadership is that an amateur can be more easily manipulated by special interests against the best interests of the nation. The hypothesis is tested by technically analyzing three case studies on proposals from the Secretary of Energy. The results show 1) requests for budget cuts undermining DOE's mission, 2) requests for redundant studies wasting DOE resources, and 3) counter-productive recommendations derived from a misrepresentation of the studies' results, which indicate technical competence is important for DOE leadership. These preliminary results indicate technical competency is important for leaders running organizations that oversee research. Finally, a potential policy safe guard to the risks of extreme technical incompetence is provided, which can be applied to either independent- or politically-appointed bureaucrats. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Bureaucrats; Leadership; Management; Political appointments; Research organization; Technical competence","Computer applications; Information systems; Management; Bureaucrats; Leadership; Political appointments; Research organization; Technical competence; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054460818

It employs predictive quantile regressions of excess return on a predictor for three quantiles to estimate the occurrence of the scenarios over an in-sample period and the transition probabilities of the Markov chain, predicts the expected returns under the scenarios, and generates an equity premium forecast by combining the predicted expected returns under three scenarios with the estimated transition probabilities. The second method generates an equity premium forecast by combining the individual forecasts from the first method across all predictors.

I attribute the first effect to the difficulty of obtaining information about a large, diverse social network, which the app reduces, and the second effect to the regularity with which people use information about their personal ties. © 2018 ASIS&T",,"Digital storage; Purchasing; Sales; E-mail address; On-line service; Purchase rates; Second effects; Social groups; Social networking sites; Structural diversity; Tie strengths; Social networking (online); article; e-mail; friend; human; social network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040743355

The purpose of this paper is to examine the genetic basis of deception detection performance using the classic twin study design and address the research question: how much variance in individual differences in deception detection performance can be accounted for by the variance in genetics vs environmental influences? Design/methodology/approach: In total, 192 twins, with 65 pairs of monozygotic (identical) twins and 31 pairs of dizygotic (fraternal) twins participated in an experiment. A series of behavioral genetic analyses were performed. Findings: The variability in deception detection performance was largely determined by differences in shared and non-shared environments. Research limitations/implications: The subjects were solicited during the Twins Days Festival so the sample selection and data collection were limited to the natural settings in the field. In addition, the risks and rewards associated with deception detection performance in the study are pale in comparison with those in practice. Practical implications: Deception detection performance may be improved through training programs. Corporations should continue funding training programs for deception detection. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study that examines the complementary influences of genetics and environment on people’s ability to detect deception. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Experiment; Training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042942276

Instead, pluralists argue that there are multiple ways of constructing knowledge and that we cannot decide on the one best methodology or epistemic principle; in short, pluralistic knowledge is all there is. Yet, epistemic pluralism implies the absence of a single conclusive final methodology or epistemological principle, and consequently choice of methods, theories and concepts risk becoming relativistic under pluralism. In the light of the absence of objective choice criteria this paper argues: 1) that choices can be justified through consensuses in intellectual exchanges; 2) that MacIntyrian epistemological crises are a suitable basis for consensus under pluralism; 3) choice under pluralism, understood as migration between different frameworks, becomes necessary for the development of framework-dependent narratives and resulting policy implications.

If so, what is the most effective method for doing so? These are important questions for those in education and management to consider. To better understand these questions, it is helpful to look at definitions of leadership versus management and to explore reasons why organizations need both. The use of experiential learning models developed by various researchers can be applied to the challenge. This article examines these constructs and then takes a closer look at a specific doctoral program in organizational leadership provided by Brandman University in Southern California. This program is making successful use of such constructs as evidenced by student self-reported perception on their growth as a leader. Student exit survey data is analyzed, generating three areas of emphasis: growth in knowledge about leadership, gain in capacity as a leader, and overall perceived growth as a leader. The results indicate that students overwhelmingly believe they have grown in all three areas of emphasis. The analysis also reinforces the need to use experiential learning methods that balance content acquisition with real-time experiences of consequence to create an optimal environment for student growth. © Common Ground Research Networks, Len Hightower, Marlo Waters","Brandman University; Experiential Learning; Leadership; Leadership Developmental Challenge; Leadership Education; Management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043248506
