Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture supply chain; Blockchain technology; DEMATEL; ISM; Sustainability; Traceability; Transparency","Agriculture; Decision making; Food supply; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Transparency; Causal relationships; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratories; DEMATEL; Developing economies; Faster implementation; Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); Sustainable performance; Traceability; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067237938

These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing. © 2020 The Authors","Cumulative prospect theory; Hesitant fuzzy set; Industry 4.0; Sustainability; Technology; VIKOR","Automotive industry; Decision theory; Economics; Electronics industry; Industry 4.0; Planning; Shoe manufacture; Telecommunication equipment; Textile industry; Cumulative prospect theory; Industrial revolutions; Production efficiency; Social and environmental; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainability impacts; Sustainable performance; Technology adoption; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084572031

Prior studies have reported on the influence of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability (BDA) for improved organizational agility and organizational performance, but there has been a paucity of literature regarding the role of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability in untangling the supply chain ambidexterity dilemma and organizational performance. To address these research gaps, this paper draws on the dynamic capability view of the organization under the contingent effect of environmental dynamism. We tested our research hypotheses using 281 surveys, gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire. Our results suggest that BDA has positive effects on improving supply chain agility (SCAG), supply chain adaptability (SCAD) and performance measures (cost performance and operational performance). However, we noted that hypotheses regarding the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the paths joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD were not supported. To address these unexpected results, we conducted post hoc analysis to explain the rationale behind the insignificant moderating effects of ED on the paths joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD. We found that the effects of BDA on SCAG/SCAD were higher under intermediate levels of environmental dynamism but comparatively weak when the environmental dynamism is low or high. Hence, we can argue that big data analytics can help enhance supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance, but these effects are contingent upon the level of environmental dynamism. Moreover, a non-linear, inverse U-shaped moderating effect of environmental dynamism exists. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based understanding of the organizational level of usage of big data analytics and its effects on supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance. Moreover, they further shape our understanding of how big data analytics–enabled dynamic capabilities yield differential results under the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. Hence, we believe that our results will be useful for managers who are highly optimistic about the usage of these emerging technologies and their effects on supply chain characteristics. Finally, we have outlined our study limitations and offered numerous research directions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data analytics; Dynamic capability; Organizational performance; Supply chain adaptability; Supply chain agility; Supply chain ambidexterity","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Enterprise resource management; Information management; Joining; Supply chains; Surveys; Dynamic capabilities; Emerging technologies; Environmental dynamisms; Operational performance; Organizational agility; Organizational levels; Organizational performance; Supply chain agility; Data Analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073019919

Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural supply chain; Machine learning; Smart farming; Sustainability; Systematic literature review","Agriculture; Data Analytics; Decision making; Environmental technology; Food supply; Learning systems; Machine learning; Productivity; Soil conservation; Supply chains; Water conservation; Agricultural production system; Agricultural supply chains; Agricultural sustainability; Ecological sustainability; Environmental stewardship; Information and Communication Technologies; Smart farming; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082019942

The connection between I4.0 and CE is unveiled by addressing the case-based model affecting the economic and environmental performances imparting two important dimensions: (i) the information sharing with the reverse logistics system is in real-time mode, and (ii) diffusion of green product in the market. The effectiveness of the virtual world in I4.0 environment is explored using simulation of reverse logistics model involving operations such as inventory and production planning policy, family-based dispatching rules of remanufacturing, and additive manufacturing. The remanufacturing model examines the trade-off between set-up delays and the availability of green transportation. For managerial insights, Taguchi experimental design framework has been used for the analysis. Based on the trade-off analysis between environmental and economic performances, the findings of the paper suggest appropriate combinations of information-sharing and family-based dispatching rules. Further, the findings suggest that, given the I4.0 and circular capabilities, it is necessary to focus on the cost of the socially influenced operations involving factors such as collection investment and size of the end-user market that governs the product returns.

While the amount of data made available through digitisation has enabled supply chain benefits, there still exist challenges regarding the rapid digitisation of the field. Therein lies opportunities for scholars to leverage the growing amount of data through knowledge management to cultivate valuable information for organisations. The purpose of this paper is to understand future inquiries for scholars to broaden their perspectives and leveraging knowledge management to enhance the supply chain digitisation research paradigm. This is done through both a large-scale literature review as well as a textual analysis and forecasting on industry- and field-applications, technologies and topics in digitisation. Utilizing textual data as well as google trends data from 2010 to 2018, comparisons are conducted on two measurements (prevalence and growth) to determine significant differences between the scholarly publications and practitioner (news and video) media to compare scholarly vs. practitioner activity in the aforementioned areas of supply chain digitisation. Applying the field of knowledge management to supply chain management through a knowledge management theoretical framework, this paper provides future research inquiries pertaining to how scholars can utilize the largely ignored areas of supply chain digitisation as well as the growing areas to explain how the human dimension of supply chain management can be further explored for the purposes of optimizing supply chain digital performance. © 2019","Digitisation; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Supply chain","Forecasting; Knowledge management; Supply chains; Chain digitisation; Digitisation; Field application; Human dimensions; Integration of knowledge; Literature reviews; Scholarly publication; Theoretical framework; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070683093

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Hospitality services; Human-robot interaction; Intention to use robots; Social robots","artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; ecotourism; hospitality industry; numerical model; robotics; service quality; tourism management; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075628508

Natural disasters and unexpected events are prime examples of such determining factors, as they have profound effects on individuals and society, and as a result have the potential to affect tourism flows considerably. Several theoretical arguments exist why natural disasters and unexpected events could influence tourist destination choices. However, empirical research to confirm the nature and extent of impacts of disasters on tourism is lacking. To address this gap, this paper incorporates a dataset on natural and man-made disaster events into a model of international tourism flows to evaluate the effect of different types of disasters on international arrivals at the national level. Findings provide evidence that the occurrence of different types of event change tourist flows to varying degrees. Although in some cases a positive effect is estimated, in general the impacts are negative, resulting in reduced tourist arrivals following an event. Understanding the relationship between disaster events and tourism is helpful for destination managers who make critical decisions in relation to recovery, reconstruction and marketing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Disaster; Gravity model; Hazard; Unexpected event","data set; hazard management; marketing; natural disaster; numerical model; reconstruction; recovery; tourism management; tourist destination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078654306

The results suggest the existence of a significant positive “U-shaped” relationship between MA and GEE, no matter in the short-term or long-term. However, for traditional economic efficiency, in the short-term, MA first inhibits it and then promotes it; while in the long-term, there is no significant positive “U-shaped” relationship between the two. In addition, industrial structure upgrading plays an important mediating role between MA and GEE, which accounts for 31.992%. Therefore, this paper believes that in order to improve green economic efficiency, it is necessary to dynamically adjust regional related policies, eliminate the congestion effect caused by manufacturing agglomeration, and achieve high-quality development of manufacturing agglomeration through industrial structure transformation and upgrading. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic spatial panel Durbin model; Green economic efficiency; Manufacturing agglomeration; Mediating effect model","Agglomeration; Efficiency; Green manufacturing; Industrial research; Dynamic spatial; Economic efficiency; Green economies; Industrial structure transformation; Industrial structures; Mediating effect; Mediating roles; Non-linear impact; Industrial economics; agglomeration; efficiency measurement; energy market; manufacturing; panel data; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091574459

One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.

Green supply chain management (GSCM) has been regarded as an effective tool in China for mitigating the negative effects that firms have on the environment. However, the extent to which GSCM pressures influence GSCM practices, and whether and how GSCM practices affect GSCM performance are topics that remain under-explored. Combining Institutional Theory, Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, and the literature on GSCM, our study sheds light on the relationship among GSCM pressures, practices, and performance under the moderating effect of quick response (QR) technology. Using statistical analysis of the collected data and case studies from companies in China, we establish several results. First, among different GSCM pressures, market and export pressures have significant impacts on GSCM practices, whereas cost pressure does not influence GSCM practices significantly. Second, internal improvement practice exerts a significant impact on GSCM practices, while external improvement practice negatively affects positive economic performance. In addition, ecology practice has significantly influenced environmental, positive economic, and operational performance. Third, QR technology suppresses the positive effect between internal improvement practice and negative economic performance. Two real cases from Huawei (telecommunications technologies) and Beijing Benz Automotive (automobile manufacturing) are conducted to verify the findings and generate additional insights.

Many platforms hire agents to serve customers who are risk sensitive towards the waiting-time. In this paper, we apply the mean-risk theory to analytically explore how the risk attitude of customers affects the optimal service pricing decision of the on-demand platform, consumer surplus (CS) of customers, the expected profit (EP) and profit risk (PR) of the platform (and the hired service agents). In the basic model, assuming consumers are homogeneous, we find that if the customers are more risk averse (risk seeking), the optimal service price will drop (increase). Comparing among the three different risk attitudes of customers, we find that when the customers are risk seeking, the CS and the platform's EP are highest, even though the platform's PR is also highest. While the opposite happens when the customers are risk averse. In the extended model with a market including customers with different risk attitudes, the blockchain technology helps the platform assess the proportion of risk seeking, risk neutral and risk averse customers accurately. We explore the optimal service prices under both the common pricing policy and the customized pricing policy (with-respect-to customer's risk attitude), and derive the value of blockchain technology mediated customized service pricing strategy. We conclude by highlighting that the risk attitudes of customers play a critical role in determining the optimal on-demand service pricing, and the blockchain technology is a valuable technological tool to help. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral OR; Blockchain; Mean-risk analysis; Platform operations; Pricing","Blockchain; Costs; Decision theory; Profitability; Risk assessment; Sales; Behavioral OR; Consumer surplus; Customized services; Expected profits; On-demand services; Optimal pricing; Platform operations; Technological tools; Risk analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079875512

One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance. This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and equity. © 2019 The Authors","Equity; Governance; Mobility as a service; Smart mobility; Technological transition","Efficiency; Intelligent systems; Public risks; Telecommunication industry; Telecommunication services; Traffic control; Urban transportation; Critical assessment; Equity; Governance; Intelligent transport systems; Public interventions; Societal implications; Socio-technical transitions; Technological transition; Service industry; accessibility; conceptual framework; efficiency measurement; governance approach; intelligent transportation system; mobility; technological development; technology adoption; transportation planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072749072

However, while researchers using PLS-SEM routinely stress the causal-predictive nature of their analyses, the model evaluation assessment relies exclusively on criteria designed to assess the path model's explanatory power. To take full advantage of the purpose of causal prediction in PLS-SEM, it is imperative for researchers to comprehend the efficacy of various quality criteria, such as traditional PLS-SEM criteria, model fit, PLSpredict, cross-validated predictive ability test (CVPAT) and model selection criteria. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review was conducted to understand empirical studies employing the use of the causal prediction criteria available for PLS-SEM in the database of Industrial Management and Data Systems (IMDS) and Management Information Systems Quarterly (MISQ). Furthermore, this study discusses the details of each of the procedures for the causal prediction criteria available for PLS-SEM, as well as how these criteria should be interpreted. While the focus of the paper is on demystifying the role of causal prediction modeling in PLS-SEM, the overarching aim is to compare the performance of different quality criteria and to select the appropriate causal-predictive model from a cohort of competing models in the IS field. Findings: The study found that the traditional PLS-SEM criteria (goodness of fit (GoF) by Tenenhaus, R2 and Q2) and model fit have difficulty determining the appropriate causal-predictive model. In contrast, PLSpredict, CVPAT and model selection criteria (i.e. Bayesian information criterion (BIC), BIC weight, Geweke–Meese criterion (GM), GM weight, HQ and HQC) were found to outperform the traditional criteria in determining the appropriate causal-predictive model, because these criteria provided both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions in PLS-SEM. Originality/value: This research substantiates the use of the PLSpredict, CVPAT and the model selection criteria (i.e. BIC, BIC weight, GM, GM weight, HQ and HQC). It provides IS researchers and practitioners with the knowledge they need to properly assess, report on and interpret PLS-SEM results when the goal is only causal prediction, thereby contributing to safeguarding the goal of using PLS-SEM in IS studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Causal prediction; CVPAT; Model fit; Model selection criteria; PLSpredict; Traditional PLS criteria","Forecasting; Information management; Information use; Least squares approximations; Bayesian information criterion; Design/methodology/approach; Model selection criteria; Partial least square (PLS); Predictive abilities; Predictive modeling; Structural equation modeling; Structural relationship; Predictive analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088930666

No empirical study was found in the supply chain literature that specifically examines the relationships among Additive Manufacturing adoption, flexibility and performance; the paper therefore fills an important gap in the supply chain literature. The research is based on a quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey from a total of 124 medium-and large-sized European Union automotive manufacturing companies. The hypothesized relationships are tested using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The research provides insights into how supply chain flexibility mediates the effect of Additive Manufacturing adoption on supply chain performance in the context of European automotive industry. Research findings indicate that Additive Manufacturing adoption positively impacts supply chain flexibility and that, in turn, supply chain flexibility positively impacts supply chain performance. This suggests that companies should focus on flexibilities in the supply chain to improve its performance. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the value of Additive Manufacturing adoption for supply chain flexibility and performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing adoption; Automotive industry; Supply chain flexibility; Supply chain performance","3D printers; Additives; Automotive industry; Industrial research; Least squares approximations; Supply chains; Surveys; Automotive manufacturing; Conceptual frameworks; Partial least square (PLS); Quantitative approach; Questionnaire surveys; Structural equation modeling; Supply chain flexibility; Supply chain performance; Flexible manufacturing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080035584

The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have limited resources and therefore, would like to see the benefits from investments before allowing adopting SMS. This study uses a combination of exploratory and empirical research design to identify and validate the performance measures relevant to the evaluation of SMS investments in auto-component manufacturing SMMEs based in India. The study found that an Industry 4.0 enabled SMS offer more competitive benefits compared to a traditional manufacturing system. The planned investments in SMS can be evaluated on ten performance dimensions namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis & prognosis, computing, social and ecological sustainability.

We build a stylized duopoly model to analyze the product-information-disclosure Nash game between two rental service platforms whose products-to-rent are substituble. We derive the equilibrium level of product information disclosure and identify conditions under which the platforms choose to disclose or not to disclose information, which correspond to different types of supply chains. For the basic model, we find that there exists a critical threshold on the information-sensitive consumers which helps each platform decide whether or not to disclose product information. If the information auditing cost is sufficiently small, both platforms should disclose the product information as much as possible. For products with higher profit margin, both platforms are more likely to disclose information. We also explore the impacts of product information disclosure on the consumer surplus and seller benefits, and discuss the roles played by the blockchain technology. To check robustness of the results as well as to examine different supply chain configurations, we extend the analysis to the cases including (i) the platforms are risk averse in decision making, (ii) rather than selling the product, the seller (owner of the product) consigns the product to the platform and shares a revenue, and (iii) rather than two competing platforms, there is a common rental service platform providing service for two substitutable products. We find that the core insights remain valid in all the extended models.

In the absence of a vaccine, non-clinical preventative measures have been implemented as the principal means of limiting deaths. However, these measures have caused unprecedented disruption to daily lives and economic activity. Given this developing crisis, the potential for a second wave of infections and the near certainty of future pandemics, lessons need to be rapidly gleaned from the available data. We address the challenges of cross-country comparisons by allowing for differences in reporting and variation in underlying socio-economic conditions between countries. Our analyses show that, to date, differences in policy interventions have out-weighed socio-economic variation in explaining the range of death rates observed in the data. Our epidemiological models show that across 8 countries a further week long delay in imposing lockdown would likely have cost more than half a million lives. Furthermore, those countries which acted more promptly saved substantially more lives than those that delayed. Linking decisions over the timing of lockdown and consequent deaths to economic data, we reveal the costs that national governments were implicitly prepared to pay to protect their citizens as reflected in the economic activity foregone to save lives. These ‘price of life’ estimates vary enormously between countries, ranging from as low as around $100,000 (e.g. the UK, US and Italy) to in excess of $1million (e.g. Denmark, Germany, New Zealand and Korea). The lowest estimates are further reduced once we correct for under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Modeling; Price of life; Valuation","Country comparisons; Economic activities; Economic data; Epidemiological models; National governments; Policy intervention; Socio-economic conditions; Socio-economics; Economics; cause of death; comparative study; economic activity; epidemiology; price determination; socioeconomic conditions; Denmark; Germany; Italy; Korea; New Zealand; United Kingdom; United States; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089084380

We theorise on tracing apps and mass acceptance and conduct a full-factorial experiment to investigate how app installation intention is influenced by different app specifications based on three benefit appeals, two privacy designs, and two convenience designs. By applying quantile regression, we not only estimate the general effect of these app specifications but also uncover how their influence differs among citizens with different propensities for acceptance (i.e. critics, undecided, advocates)–a crucial insight for succeeding with mass acceptance. This study contributes to research in three ways: we theorise how mass acceptance differs from established app acceptance, we provide a fine-grained approach to investigating the app specifications salient for mass acceptance, and we reveal contextualised insights specific to tracing apps with multi-layered benefit structures.

Particularly, where the 4th industrial revolution is expected to fundamentally change the economy, society, and financial systems, it may also create opportunities for a zero-carbon future. Therefore, in the context of UK's legally binding commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050, we analyse the role of economic growth, R&amp;D expenditures, financial development, and energy consumption in causing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Employing the bootstrapping bounds testing approach to examine short- and long-run relationships, our analysis is based on historical data from 1870 to 2017. The results suggest the existence of cointegration between CO2 emissions and its determinants. Financial development and energy consumption lead to environmental degradation, but R&amp;D expenditures help to reduce CO2 emissions. The estimated environmental effects of economic growth support the EKC hypothesis. While a U-shaped relationship is found between financial development and CO2 emissions, the nexus between R&amp;D expenditures and CO2 emissions is analogues to the EKC. In the context of the efforts to tackle climate change, our findings suggest policy prescriptions by using financial development and R&amp;D expenditures as the key tools to meet the emissions target. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 Emissions; Economic Growth; Financial Development; Net-zero Emissions; R&D Expenditures","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy utilization; Finance; Industrial economics; Binding commitment; Bounds testing approaches; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decarbonisation; Economic growths; Financial development; Financial system; Industrial revolutions; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; expenditure; financial system; research and development; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090045566

The whole world has come together to work in the direction to protect the environment. Consumers are increasingly becoming cautious towards the impact of their consumption pattern on environment and organisations can attain a competitive edge by leveraging this cautiousness by offering them green products/brands. However, it is importance for the marketers to understand that how increasing levels of sustainability awareness impacts other factors which explain pro-environmental behaviour of customers. To fill the existing gap in the current literature in this regard, the current study aims to build a structural model which includes social and environmental sustainability awareness in measuring customer altruism, buying intention, loyalty and customer evangelism. The theoretical model extends the existing framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and explores the decision-making framework regarding ethical behaviour. Through existing literature review and expert input, the indicators (variables) for each construct were recognised. After that, data was collected from 331 respondents through a structurally designed questionnaire; the hypothetical model was test using the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique.

Despite continuing alignment between tourism and sustainable development in both academic and policy circles, not only have the intervening two decades proved this argument in practice to be correct, but also there is little evidence of a more sustainable tourism sector. This paper, therefore, returns to the theoretical relationship between tourism and sustainable development, considering more recent transformations in understandings of the concept of development as well as contemporary approaches to sustainable development.

In order to stay competitive, both these transitions need to follow sustainable resource management and digital transformation principles. However, there are barriers to these changes that organizations should consider. Both Industry 4.0 transition, in other words Industry 3.5, and circularity transition require great efforts to deal with these barriers; in the current environment, organizations need to deal with these barriers simultaneously for more sustainable resource management. This study focuses in particular on circular supply chains in the Industry 3.5 stage. There are some studies that suggest barriers to Industry 4.0 and circular supply chains separately, none of these studies consider them together. From this point of view, this study contributes to existing literature by presenting synchronized barriers that integrate circular supply chain and Industry 4.0 barriers.

More specifically, recent findings of algorithm aversion—the reluctance of human forecasters to use superior but imperfect algorithms—raise questions about whether joint human-algorithm decision making is feasible in practice. In this paper, we systematically review the topic of algorithm aversion as it appears in 61 peer-reviewed articles between 1950 and 2018 and follow its conceptual trail across disciplines. We categorize and report on the proposed causes and solutions of algorithm aversion in five themes: expectations and expertise, decision autonomy, incentivization, cognitive compatibility, and divergent rationalities. Although each of the presented themes addresses distinct features of an algorithmic decision aid, human users of the decision aid, and/or the decision making environment, apparent interdependencies are highlighted. We conclude that resolving algorithm aversion requires an updated research program with an emphasis on theory integration.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Asset management; Building and city levels; Digital twin (DT); Operation and maintenance (O&M)","Artificial intelligence; Asset management; Buildings; Data Analytics; Decision making; Information management; Life cycle; Maintenance; Research and development management; Decision making process; Digital simulation models; Heterogeneous data sources; Infrastructure assets; Multi tier architecture; Operation and maintenance; System architectures; University of Cambridge; Digital twin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

Accurate carbon trading volume and price forecasts have far-reaching implications for environmental and energy policy formulation. As the country with the most massive carbon emissions in the world, China's carbon price trends, carbon trading volume trends, and policy orientation are of great significance. As matters stand, there are few studies on carbon price and trading volume forecasts, and no research paper has covered carbon price and trading volume forecasts for all carbon trading markets in China. In order to provide a relatively complete reference for the carbon price and trading volume in China, this paper uses six machine learning models to predict the daily carbon price and trading volume of eight carbon markets in China, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Fujian, Tianjin, Chongqing. The prediction models include extreme gradient boosting, random forest, kernel-based nonlinear extension of the Arps decline model optimized by grey wolf optimizer (GWO-KNEA), support vector machine optimized by particle swarm optimizer, support vector machine optimized by fruit fly optimizer and simulated annealing algorithm, and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Moreover, an advanced data denoising method, i.e., complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), is used in the models to smooth the raw data. Because the eight carbon trading markets have different carbon price and trading volume distribution characteristics in time series, by comparing the prediction results, more suitable models for the specific carbon market can be obtained. The prediction results show that CEEMDAN-GWO-KNEA and CEEMDAN-RBFNN are more competitive in predicting carbon prices and trading volume in China because of their best performance in many datasets. The average accuracy of CEEMDAN-RBFNN and CEMDAN-GWO-KNEA in carbon price prediction is 98.40% and 97.89%, respectively. The predictive stability of each model in different application scenarios is also discussed. The results show that high prediction accuracy does not mean better prediction stability, but CEEMDAN-RBFNN and CEMDAN-GWO-KNEA can still guarantee high stability in most datasets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon trading market; China; Forecasting; Machine learning; Price; Trading volume","Decision trees; Emission control; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Simulated annealing; Support vector machines; Carbon trading; China; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Particle swarm optimizers; Price; Radial basis function neural networks; Simulated annealing algorithms; Trading volumes; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076142378

These results also show that there are phase relationships between those paired prices. The volatility spillover results indicate that the agricultural sector is the most affected by shocks from the other markets. The return series of the industrial input prices at all frequencies appears to be the main source of volatility transmission to the prices of the other commodities over the whole period.

To evaluate the effect of emission trading system on carbon emission reduction, this study applies a robust econometric method difference-in-difference estimation on city-level panel data in China from 2004 to 2015. The findings of this study indicate that the emission trading policy adopted in pilot regions has reduced carbon emission by approximately 16.2% and such effect is particularly prominent in eastern areas of China where the economy is more developed.

Owning channel advantages and rich transaction data regarding suppliers’ sales, inventory, and credits, e-commerce platforms (henceforth, e-retailers) can offer online distribution channels and online financing service for SMEs to facilitate their distribution and alleviate their capital constraints. This study analyzes the pricing competition in a dual-channel supply chain consisting of one capital-constrained supplier and one e-retailer providing finance. The supplier can sell her products either through the e-retailer using the online channel or through her direct offline channel. The e-retailer offers finance to the supplier if she is capital-constrained. We examine the equilibrium price and the associated optimal quantity and profits in dual channels when supplier may face capital constraint and compete with e-retailer horizontally or vertically. We find that e-retailer finance is a value-added service for e-retailer and that the increased profits generated from financing offerings can offset the lowered revenue in the online distribution channel. E-retailer finance can increase market share, which also benefits the supplier. Participating in the vertical competition through announcing pricing decisions earlier than does the supplier can help the e-retailer seize the first-mover advantage. Further, we present the value of e-retailer finance and examine the impact of various financing, operational, and consumer-related factors on pricing and channel structure. We also provide guidelines for e-retailers and financing-constrained suppliers to utilize e-retailer finance to optimize their dual-channel structure and to make optimal pricing decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dual channel; E-retailer finance; Game theory; Pricing; Supply chain finance","Competition; Constrained optimization; Costs; Electronic commerce; Game theory; Profitability; Supply chains; Distribution channel; Dual channel; Dual channel supply chain; Dual-channel structures; First mover advantages; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Supply chain finances; Vertical competition; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077378623

This “decision making” side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as “design.” Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture?. This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem-solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking, that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking. Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI—Netflix and Airbnb (complemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)—which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human-intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and enhancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles. AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people-centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human-based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle. In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem-solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead handle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously. This paper discusses the implications of these insights for design and innovation management scholars and practitioners. © 2020 Product Development & Management Association",,"Behavioral research; Computational complexity; Decision making; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Problem solving; Creative problem-solving; Design and innovations; Digital technologies; Learning iteration; Principles of design; Product life cycles; Theoretical framework; Traditional boundaries; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083781043

This paper develops a framework for exploring the implications of a more scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making. The panel sample of our randomized control trial includes 116 Italian startups and 16 data points over a period of about one year. Both the treatment and control groups receive 10 sessions of general training on how to obtain feedback from the market and gauge the feasibility of their idea. We teach the treated startups to develop frameworks for predicting the performance of their idea and conduct rigorous tests of their hypotheses, very much as scientists do in their research. We let the firms in the control group instead follow their intuitions about how to assess their idea, which has typically produced fairly standard search heuristics. We find that entrepreneurs who behave like scientists perform better, are more likely to pivot to a different idea, and are not more likely to drop out than the control group in the early stages of the startup. These results are consistent with the main prediction of our theory: A scientific approach improves precision-it reduces the odds of pursuing projects with false positive returns and increases the odds of pursuing projects with false negative returns. © 2019 INFORMS.","Decision making; Entrepreneurship; Randomized control trial; Scientific method; Startup","Heuristic algorithms; Reactor startup; Classical approach; Entrepreneurship; False negatives; False positive; Randomized control trials; Scientific method; Search heuristics; Trial and error; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080100984

With insights gained from Business Analytics, companies are able to develop new or improved products/services. However, few studies have investigated the mechanism through which Business Analytics contributes to a firm's innovation success. This research aims to address this gap by theoretically and empirically investigating the relationship between Business Analytics and innovation. To achieve this aim, absorptive capacity theory is used as a theoretical lens to inform the development of a research model. Absorptive capacity theory refers to a firm's ability to recognize the value of new, external information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends. The research model covers the use of Business Analytics, environmental scanning, data-driven culture, innovation (new product newness and meaningfulness), and competitive advantage. The research model is tested through a questionnaire survey of 218 UK businesses. The results suggest that Business Analytics directly improves environmental scanning which in turn helps to enhance a company's innovation. Business Analytics also directly enhances data-driven culture that in turn impacts on environmental scanning. Data-driven culture plays another important role by moderating the effect of environmental scanning on new product meaningfulness. The findings demonstrate the positive impact of business analytics on innovation and the pivotal roles of environmental scanning and data-driven culture. Organizations wishing to realize the potential of Business Analytics thus need changes in both their external and internal focus. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Absorptive capacity; Analytics; Big Data; Data-driven culture; Innovation","Competition; Scanning; Surveys; Absorptive capacity; Analytics; Business analytics; Competitive advantage; Data driven; Environmental scanning; External informations; Questionnaire surveys; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049330316

Results indicate that technological turbulence, green recruitment and selection and green training, involvement and development are positive predictors of green team creativity. Green performance and compensation negatively predict green team creativity. While green team creativity positively predicts green product innovation, environmental dynamic capability negatively predicts green product innovation. Technological turbulence reinforces the positive impact of green recruitment and selection on green team creativity and dampens the positive impact of green training, involvement and development on green team creativity. Furthermore, green team creativity is a complementary and competitive mediator.

Quantitative attributes can be assessed by accurate numerical values, interval values or fuzzy numbers, while qualitative attributes can be evaluated by belief distributions, linguistic variables or intuitionistic fuzzy sets. However, the determination of attribute weights is still an open issue in MADM problems until now. In the traditional objective weight assignment method, attributes are usually assessed by accurate values. In this paper, an entropy weight assignment method is proposed to dealing with the situation where the assessment of attributes can contain uncertainties, e.g., interval values, or contain both uncertainties and incompleteness, e.g., belief distributions. The advantage of the proposed method lies in that uncertainties and incompleteness contained in the interval numerical values or belief distributions can be preserved in the generated weights. Specifically, several pairs of programming models to generate the weights of attributes are constructed in three different circumstances: (1) quantitative attribute expressed by interval values; (2) incomplete belief distribution with accurate belief degrees; and (3) belief distribution constituted by interval belief degrees. The evidential reasoning approach is then utilized to aggregate the distributions of attributes based on the generated attribute weights. The normalized interval weight vector is defined, and the characteristics of the weight assignment method are discussed. The proposed method has been experimented with real data to illustrate its advantages and the potential in supporting MADM with uncertain and incomplete information. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Belief distribution; Entropy weight assignment method; Evidential reasoning; Incompleteness; Interval belief degree; Interval value","Decision making; Entropy; Fuzzy sets; Belief degrees; Belief distribution; Entropy weights; Evidential reasoning; Incompleteness; Interval value; Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074481826

This is a high time to assess the sustainability in energy systems for meeting the requirements of energy with an enhanced economic, ecological, and social performance from a nation context. The energy system plays a significant role in deciding the economic progress of emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil, and Africa. In this paper, an original attempt has been made to list and evaluate important indicators for sustainability assessment of energy systems development and management in an emerging economy especially India. Firstly, based on the analysis of the extant literature and then followed by expert opinion, potential key sustainability assessment indicators for energy systems development and management were identified.

Lean is efficiency focused, whereas Sustainability Oriented Innovation emphasizes on responsiveness. Although lean and sustainability oriented innovation have been separately researched, there is a gap in knowledge on the combined effect of lean and sustainability oriented innovation (SOI) on SMEs Supply Chain sustainability. SMEs have limited resources and face numerous competition. Therefore, their supply chain sustainability can only be achieved through most appropriate trade-off between economic, environment and social aspects of business. The purpose of this paper is to understand the combined effect of sustainability oriented innovation and lean practices, on supply chain sustainability performance of SMEs. The study uses a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) based framework and applies this to a group of SMEs within the Eastern part of India. Lean and sustainability oriented innovation are considered as input criteria, and economic, operational, environmental and social aspects are considered as output criteria of the proposed framework. DEA segregates inefficient SMEs and suggests at least a SME to benchmark. Subsequently, the study undertakes qualitative approach to suggest improvement measures for the inefficient SMEs. The results reveal that combined lean and SOI helps achieve SMEs' supply chain sustainability. The findings are useful for policy makers and Individual SMEs' owners and managers to undertake measures for improving sustainability. Theoretically this research contributes a DEA-based framework to study the effect of combined lean and SOI on sustainability that helps improving SMEs’ sustainability performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Small and medium enterprises; Supply chain sustainability; Sustainability-oriented innovation","Competition; Data envelopment analysis; Economic and social effects; Social aspects; Supply chains; Combined effect; Improvement measure; Lean practices; Policy makers; Qualitative approach; Small and medium enterprise; Small and medium sized enterprise; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075863244

Public opinion on self-driving vehicles or AVs is evolving rapidly, and many behavioral questions have not yet been addressed. This study emphasizes AV mode choices, including Americans’ willingness to pay (WTP) to ride with a stranger in a shared AV fleet vehicle on various trip types and the long-distance travel impacts of AVs. Exactly 2,588 complete responses to a stated-preference survey with 70 questions provide valuable insights on privacy concerns, safety and dynamic ride-sharing with strangers, long-distance travel and preferences for smarter vehicles and transport systems. Two hurdle models (which allow for a high share of zero-value responses) were estimated: one to predict WTP to share a ride and another to determine WTP to anonymize location while using AVs, and a multinomial logit was developed to estimate long-distance mode choices with AVs and SAVs available. Results suggest that WTP to share rides will rise over time, for a variety of reasons, and SAV use will be particularly popular for long-distance business travel. Elasticity estimates suggest that privacy may not be an important concern for AV-based travel. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Autonomous vehicles; Dynamic ride-sharing; Mode choice; Privacy; Shared; Travel behavior survey; Willingness to pay","Data privacy; Fleet operations; Social aspects; Surveys; Mode choice; Ride-sharing; Shared; Travel behaviors; Willingness to pay; Autonomous vehicles; advanced technology; modeling; preference behavior; transportation mode; transportation system; travel behavior; unmanned vehicle; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074343293

Our analysis shows that the mechanism of how AI affects technological innovation is that the former promotes technological innovation through accelerating knowledge creation and technology spillover, improving learning and absorptive capacities, while increasing R&D and talent investment. Our empirical results indicate that under the condition of controlling intensity of R&D investment, FDI, ownership structure, technical imitation, AI significantly promotes technological innovation. And the impact of AI on technological innovation experiences sector heterogeneity: AI has more significant impact on the technological innovation of low-tech sectors.

As such, the first aim of the present review is to identify and synthesize a set of common critiques levied against UET research. In doing so, we unpack important nuance within each critique while establishing a common vocabulary to facilitate greater consistency in how these critiques are discussed by scholars, editors, and reviewers. Next, we analyze the past decade of UET research (i.e., empirical and conceptual articles) to provide a progress report on the state of the literature as it pertains to each critique. Based on this analysis, we issue a “verdict,” providing clear guidance on what issues still need to be resolved and offering clear recommendations for UET scholars moving forward.

This paper examines end-of-first-life applications of EVs batteries in a low-carbon circular economy following global transition to EVs and net zero economy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors within the EV industry in the UK. Drawing on Stahel closed-loop solutions, a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of these interviews revealed the need for business models towards coherent low-carbon circular economy of the value chains. This paper reveals a whole range of issues relating to: extraction of battery critical raw minerals (e.g. ethical concerns); manufacturing (e.g. lack of policy frameworks addressing value chain emissions); distribution and sale (e.g. gaps in circular built economy strategy and transition plan); use (e.g. lack of a functioning market for end-of-first-life batteries) as well as research and innovation (e.g. lack of infrastructure to deal with end-of-first-life cells). The views on policy weaknesses testifies to the need for close-loop business model to not only focus on recycling battery raw minerals or repurposing battery for energy storage applications. But, should consider many aspects of an innovative policy strategy and product's global value chain, accounting for: equitable jobs, critical raw minerals dependency, circularity governance and industry standards, protecting the natural environment, tackling emissions and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. The study highlights establishing key trade-offs within policy goals considering the global value chains, as well as, harnessing synergies between social, economic and environmental goals.

The results show that green customer integration improves cost and environmental performance through green process innovation (not green product innovation). Both green product and process innovations are facilitated by green customer integration (not green supplier integration), while both green customer and supplier integration significantly depend on green internal integration.

Our research builds on the real and perceived needs and challenges faced by manufacturing SMEs and advances the field by developing and evaluating an SME-specific ‘SM adoption framework’. We have employed a multiple case study approach to acknowledge the lessons learned by selected early-adopter SMEs that have recently implemented and deployed SM tools and practices. We propose an SM adoption framework with five vital steps that SMEs interested in SM should follow: (i) identify manufacturing data available within the SME, (ii) readiness assessment of the SME data-hierarchy steps, (iii) developing SM awareness of SME leadership and staff, (iv) develop a SM tailored vision for the SMEs, and (v) identify appropriate SM tools and practices necessary to realise the tailored SM vision.

To reconcile these two divergent views, this study proposes that the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility-brand fit and sustainable customer engagement behavior is serially mediated by self-cause and/or brand integration. Furthermore, such serial mediation mechanism is moderated by environmental concern and green trust. The results of an empirical study carried out in the airline industry confirm that the link between perceived corporate social responsibility-brand fit and sustainable customer engagement behavior is serially mediated by self-cause and/or brand integration and moderated by environmental concern and green trust. Sustainable customer engagement behavior, in turn, drives customers’ extra-role, citizenship behavior that goes beyond their in-role, loyalty behavior. This study contributes to the micro-corporate social responsibility stream of cleaner production by demonstrating that the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility-brand fit and sustainable customer engagement behavior is not straightforward and by providing a theoretical framework to better explain the psychological mechanisms and boundary conditions affecting this relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Customer citizenship behavior; Environmental concern; Green trust; Sustainable customer engagement behavior","Air transportation; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Customer citizenship behaviors; Environmental concerns; Green trust; Sustainable customer engagement behavior; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082648759

Global digital infrastructure, social media, Internet of Things, robotic process automation, digital business platforms, algorithmic decision making, and other digitally enabled networks and ecosystems fuel complexity by fostering hyper-connections and mutual dependencies among human actors, technical artifacts, processes, organizations, and institutions. Complexity affects human agencies and experiences in all dimensions. Individuals and organizations turn to digitally enabled solutions to cope with the wicked problems arising out of digitalization. In the digital world, complexity and digital solutions present new opportunities and challenges for information systems (IS) research. The purpose of this special issue is to foster the development of new IS theories on the causes, dynamics, and consequences of complexity in increasing digital sociotechnical systems. In this essay, we discuss the key theories and methods of complexity science, and illustrate emerging new IS research challenges and opportunities in complex sociotechnical systems. We also provide an overview of the five articles included in the special issue. These articles illustrate how IS researchers build on theories and methods from complexity science to study wicked problems in the emerging digital world. They also illustrate how IS researchers leverage the uniqueness of the IS context to generate new insights to contribute back to complexity science. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

The theory and technologies behind these platforms have become one of the most active research topics in the fields of economics, operations research, computer science, and transportation engineering. In particular, advanced matching and dynamic pricing (DP) algorithms—the two key levers in ride-hailing—have received tremendous attention from the research community and are continuously being designed and implemented at industrial scales by ride-hailing platforms. We provide a review of matching and DP techniques in ride-hailing, and show that they are critical for providing an experience with low waiting time for both riders and drivers. Then we link the two levers together by studying a pool-matching mechanism called dynamic waiting (DW) that varies rider waiting and walking before dispatch, which is inspired by a recent carpooling product Express Pool from Uber. We show using data from Uber that by jointly optimizing DP and DW, price variability can be mitigated, while increasing capacity utilization, trip throughput, and welfare. We also highlight several key practical challenges and directions of future research from a practitioner's perspective. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","dynamic pricing; dynamic waiting; matching; ride-hailing; ride-sharing","Costs; Economics; Industrial research; Operations research; Urban growth; Dynamic pricing; Increasing capacities; matching; Matching mechanisms; Research communities; ride-hailing; Ride-sharing; Transportation engineering; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075119595

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the interrelationship between these variables in a multivariate causality study using quarterly frequency data 1985Q1-2017Q4. Empirical results indicate a unidirectional causality running from geopolitical risk index to economic growth and from geopolitical risk index to tourism.

A comparative study of consumers' online review behavior and its impact on overall satisfaction and demand in the accommodation-sharing economy and the hotel industry indicates that consumers' perceptions and behavior change gradually with changes in the level of sharing—from no sharing when staying in hotel rooms to intensive sharing when sharing rooms through collaborative consumption. Online consumer reviews focus on product and service attributes, and the influential factors of customer satisfaction and demand differ when consumers are at different accommodation-sharing levels. Not all attributes described in online reviews influence overall customer satisfaction. With a higher level of sharing, consumers' valuation changes from more to less tangible attributes. Consumers at a higher sharing level care more about social interaction and economic value than consumers at a lower sharing level. Transaction costs, particularly the information search and acquisition costs, play an important role in influencing customer purchase decisions in the sharing economy. Consumers refer to direct information for tangible attributes and to previous consumers' online reviews for intangible attributes to familiarize themselves with details before making purchase decisions. Our study provides implications that help platforms and hosts better target consumer segments with different sharing levels and more effectively utilize online reviews to generate positive electronic word of mouth to enhance consumer demand and the performance of platform economics. © 2019","Customer satisfaction; Online reviews; Product and service attributes; Sharing economy","Costs; Customer satisfaction; Economics; Hotels; Sales; Comparative studies; Electronic word of mouths; Influential factors; Online consumer reviews; Online reviews; Product and services; Sharing economy; Social interactions; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075017735

The inability to answer this question backed by data is a problem for industrial maintenance management, especially in light of the ongoing rapid transition towards an industrial environment with pervasive digital technologies. To this end, this paper, which is the first part of a two-paper series, aims to investigate and answer the question, “What is Smart Maintenance?“. The authors deployed an empirical, inductive research approach to conceptualize Smart Maintenance using focus groups and interviews with more than 110 experts from over 20 different firms. By viewing our original data through the lens of multiple general theories, our findings chart new directions for contemporary and future maintenance research. This paper describes empirical observations and theoretical interpretations cumulating in the first empirically grounded definition of Smart Maintenance and its four underlying dimensions; data-driven decision-making, human capital resource, internal integration, and external integration. In addition, the relationships between the underlying dimensions are specified and the concept structure formally modeled. This study thus achieves concept clarity with respect to Smart Maintenance, thereby making several theoretical and managerial contributions that guide both scholars and practitioners within the field of industrial maintenance management. © 2019 The Authors","Digitalization; Industrial organization; Industry 4.0; Maintenance; Manufacturing; Smart manufacturing","Decision making; Industry 4.0; Manufacture; Digital technologies; Digitalization; Human capital resources; Industrial environments; Industrial maintenance; Industrial organization; Maintenance operations; Smart manufacturing; Maintenance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075355821

This research contributes to the literature by proffering a policy framework for the emerging economies by analyzing the impact of globalization and tourism on environmental degradation, by considering the Chinese context as a sample. Following the quantile autoregressive distributed lag model, the impact of economic growth, globalization, and tourism on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the ecological footprint in China over 1978Q1-2017Q4 are analyzed. The results demonstrate that economic growth stimulates environmental degradation, while the presence of Environmental Kuznets Curve is also validated. Moreover, tourism has been found to exert positive environmental externalities, while globalization exerts negative environmental externalities. Based on the outcomes of the research, a comprehensive policy framework has been suggested, following which the Chinese economy might be able to attain the objectives of Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, and 13. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; EKC; Globalization; QARDL; Tourism","Carbon dioxide; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Public policy; Sustainable development; Tourism; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chinese economy; Ecological footprint; Economic growths; Emerging economies; Environmental Kuznets curves; Policy framework; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088152205

We examine a supply chain with multiple sites, multiple transportation channels, and multiple product planning, over multiple periods, under supply risk and demand risk. Using a numerical example, we determine the relationship between three objective functions related to responsiveness, risk, and the cost of new and seasonal products, then discuss the impact of flexibility and agility on mitigating supply chain disruptions. To show a trade-off among objective functions in our numerical example, we solve the multi-objective mixed integer programming (MOMIP) model using three multi-objective optimization methods: the weighted goal programming (WGP) method, the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON) method, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ). Our findings help decision makers with these two tasks: anticipate how much improvement in flexibility and agility will lead to an improvement in responsiveness; and create an investment plan to minimize the negative impact of supply chain disruptions by an examination of the trade-offs among responsiveness, risk, and cost. The results show that the NSGA-Ⅱ method outperforms the AUGMECON method in several metric indexes: the spacing metric, the diversity metric, and simple additive weighting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON) method; Disruption risk; Multi-objective mixed integer programming (MOMIP); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ); Supply chain management; Weighted goal programming (WGP) method","Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical methods; Supply chain management; Goal programming; Mixed integer programming; Multiple products; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective functions; Simple additive weighting; Supply-chain disruptions; Transportation channels; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070717812

Amid the global energy crisis and environmental degradation, the international port community has proposed the concept of green port. Zhuhai Port, an important shipping and logistics platform in southern China, is confronted with key questions of how to effectively conduct environmental pollution control and green development performance evaluation, while its size and business performance continue the rapid growth. To address this problem, this study first suggested a green port indicator system tailored-made for Zhuhai Port, and then uses the fuzzy importance-performance analysis (FIPA) method to determine the performance of Zhuhai Port in green port indicators before putting forward a governance strategy. The study shows that Zhuhai Port should focus on monitoring of energy consumption and pollutant emissions, innovation of scientific research technologies and development of green port schemes to deepen the concept of green development and improve the energy conservation and environmental protection capacity of the port. The research results can serve as a theoretical basis for formulation of Zhuhai's green port policies and the establishment of an effective methodology system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental pollution; Governance; Green port; Performance evaluation","Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Development performance; Energy conservation and environmental protections; Environmental pollution control; Environmental pollutions; Global economic growth; Governance; Green ports; Performance evaluation; Pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076245172

Doing so involves learning a model of decision rewards conditional on individual-specific covariates. In many practical settings, these covariates are high dimensional; however, typically only a small subset of the observed features are predictive of a decision’s success. We formulate this problem as a K-armed contextual bandit with high-dimensional covariates and present a new efficient bandit algorithm based on the LASSO estimator. We prove that our algorithm’s cumulative expected regret scales at most polylogarithmically in the covariate dimension d; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such bound for a contextual bandit. The key step in our analysis is proving a new tail inequality that guarantees the convergence of the LASSO estimator despite the non-i.i.d. data induced by the bandit policy. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical relevance of our algorithm by evaluating it on a simplified version of a medication dosing problem. A patient’s optimal medication dosage depends on the patient’s genetic profile and medical records; incorrect initial dosage may result in adverse consequences, such as stroke or bleeding. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing bandit methods and physicians in correctly dosing a majority of patients. © 2019 INFORMS.","Adaptive treatment allocation; Contextual bandits; High-dimensional statistics; LASSO; Online learning; Personalized decision making","Decision making; Contextual bandits; Covariates; Decision makers; High-dimensional; Individual levels; Medical record; On-line decision makings; Online advertising; Regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084863032

However, it is found that only a small number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have capabilities to leverage customer online insights for design innovation, which often demonstrate a significant share in national economies growth. To discover the beneath reasons regarding the barrier that prevent them to make effective utilization, in this study, as a concrete example, manufacturing SMEs in the South Wales and Greater Manchester industrial areas of the UK are focused and their potential motivations for using and knowledge of big data-based customer analytics are investigated. An exploratory survey was conducted in terms of the type of customer data they have, the storage approaches, the volume of customer data, etc. Next, a carefully devised exploratory study was undertaken to understand how SMEs perceive the relations between customer data and product design, how about their expectations from big customer data analytics and what really challenges SMEs to exploit the value of big customer data. Besides, a demonstration platform is developed to present SMEs an automatic process of analysing customer online reviews and the capacity on customer insights acquisition and strategic decision making. Finally, findings from two focus groups indicate the different managerial and technical considerations required for SMEs considering implementing big data and customer analytics. This study encourages SMEs to welcome big customer data and suggests that a cloud-based approach may be the most appropriate way of giving access to big data analytics techniques. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; Customer insight; Design innovation; Online reviews; SME","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Concrete products; Data Analytics; Decision making; Digital storage; Product design; Customer insights; Design innovations; Exploratory studies; Exploratory surveys; Online reviews; Product designers; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Strategic decision making; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075391466

While many associated operational issues have been extensively studied, research into the prediction customer demand for, and the market development of, remanufactured products is still in its infancy. The majority of the existing research into remanufactured product demand is largely based on conventional statistical models that fail to capture the non-linear behaviour of customer demand and market factors in real-world business environments, in particular e-marketplaces. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a comprehensible data-mining prediction approach, in order to achieve two objectives: (1) to provide a highly accurate and robust demand prediction model of remanufactured products; and (2) to shed light on the non-linear effect of online market factors as predictors of customer demand. Based on the real-world Amazon dataset, the results suggest that predicting remanufactured product demand is a complex, non-linear problem, and that, by using advanced machine-learning techniques, our proposed approach can predict the product demand with high accuracy. In terms of practical implications, the importance of market factors is ranked according to their predictive powers of demand, while their effects on demand are analysed through their partial dependence plots. Several insights for management are revealed by a thorough comparison of the sales impact of these market factors on remanufactured and new products. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Machine learning; Regression trees; Remanufactured products","Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Business environments; Machine learning techniques; Market development; Nonlinear behaviours; Nonlinear problems; Operational issues; Regression trees; Remanufactured products; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071125070

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business; Machine learning; Management; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study","Accident prevention; Agricultural robots; Decision support systems; Health care; Job satisfaction; Leisure industry; Project management; Reusability; Service industry; Social aspects; Supply chains; Tourism; Business and management; Design and evaluations; Health-care managements; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multiple stakeholders; Rigorous evaluation; Systematic literature review; Technology adoption; Information management; artificial intelligence; business development; literature review; machine learning; management; social impact; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085273894

We include consumer-derived explanations for the decline in physical retail, and the growth of online shopping, as well as anticipated consequences for both, individual consumers and society in general, in a conceptual framework. We find many consumers lamenting the disappearance of physical retailers. Most expect negative consequences for themselves and society. However, many consumers also describe physical retailers as often unable to deliver on basic retail functions, and many are accepting of a future with very few physical stores.

The feedback mechanism in the “Carbon-Energy-Finance” system makes the information connectedness dynamics more complex since we add equity, bond and non-energy commodity assets into the system. Using modified error variance decomposition and network diagrams, we quantify and systematically analyze how the European carbon market connects with information from a wide range of other markets. Our results indicate: (i) the nature of information spillover changes over time, with system-wide return connectedness being higher and more variable than the volatility interdependence; (ii) both the oil and carbon markets closely connect with equity and non-energy commodity markets rather than bond markets; (iii) we identify three structural breaks in carbon volatility and their implication for carbon-finance linkages; (iv) financial risk-type macroeconomic factors make greater contributions to system-wide connectedness than commodity factors.

We provide strong evidence for a strong positive association between GHG voluntary disclosures and gender diversity, which constitutes an important input to the ongoing debate about the role of women in the boardroom. The governance mechanism of environmental committees is not found to significantly affect GHG disclosures. This adds to the growing empirical evidence in the literature that questions the effectiveness of the current board structures in serving the wider needs of stakeholders and in addressing the relevant issues on climate change. Overall, our results suggest that by being diverse and open to a mixed-gender governance approach, a firm can better serve the demands of stakeholders and legitimise their green credentials, thus gaining more trust from a broad range of stakeholders other than their shareholders. The noneffectiveness of the environmental committees in enhancing GHG voluntary disclosures demonstrates that firms may not have to directly link the relevant governance mechanism to their disclosure decisions and practices. © 2020 The Authors.

However, these efforts are not successful for some organizations, and there is an opportunity to explore what it takes to have an effective IMS implementation. Prior studies attribute several barriers to implementation. Yet, little is known about the degree to which these barriers impede implementation. To fill this gap in the literature, we have developed a systematic framework to prioritize barriers. We first identify and classify barriers using a literature review and modified Delphi method providing twenty-six barriers categorized under six main categories. These included Resources and Management, People, Implementation, Economic, Social & Legal and Cultural. Next, we used Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to calculate weights and rankings of barriers and sub-barriers. We then take this process a step further by using a Grey preference by similarity to ideal solution (GTOPSIS) methodology to further prioritize alternatives. The results reveal the implementation and social & legal barrier categories ranked highest among major categories. Overall rankings showed that the economic and implementation sub-barrier is more important than the other twenty-four sub-barriers within different categories. The contributions of this study provide new insights regarding levels of integration and employee motivation as important to overcoming barriers to implementation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis checked the robustness of the proposed research framework that could be implemented to overcome the IMS barriers. This study is the first of its kind to organize barriers of IMS in this way. The outcomes of this study will assist organizations and policymakers in their decision making regarding IMS implementation while simultaneously improving sustainability practices. Researchers will find new IMS implementation insights and constructs for further empirical investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; Barriers; Grey TOPSIS; Implementation; Integrated management system; Ranking","Behavioral research; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Barriers; Grey TOPSIS; Implementation; Integrated management systems; Ranking; Integrated control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078097075

This paper estimates the impact of two facets of system performance on bike-share ridership: Accessibility (how far the user must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bicycle). We obtain these estimates from a structural demand model for ridership estimated using data from the Vélib' system in Paris. We find that every additional meter of walking to a station decreases a user's likelihood of using a bike from that station by 0.194% (±0.0693%), and an even more significant reduction at higher distances (>300 m). These estimates imply that almost 80% of bike-share usage comes from areas within 300 m of stations, highlighting the need for dense station networks. We find that a 10% increase in bike-availability would increase ridership by 12.211% (±1.097%), threefourths of which comes from fewer abandonments and the rest of which comes from increased user interest. We illustrate the use of our estimates in comparing the effect of adding stations or increasing bike-availabilities in different parts of the city, at different times, and in evaluating other proposed improvements. © 2019 INFORMS.",,"Management; Operations research; Chicago; Demand modeling; New York; Station network; Urban commuting; User interests; Bicycles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094838430

In conjunction with the online selling channel, our research explores the retailer's deployment of physical showrooms which mitigates consumer fit uncertainty. Beyond asking whether the deployment of physical showrooms can improve the retailer's profit and which assortment strategy is more profitable for the retailer, our analysis also addresses the questions of how the showroom deployment strategy impacts the product prices and the information service provision. The main findings are threefold. First, the effect of physical showroom deployment on retailer's performance is determined by the showroom feasibility. A high level of showroom feasibility (i.e., relatively low setup cost and high proportion of local consumers) is more likely to increase the profit of the retailer who establishes physical showrooms, and vice versa. Second, the profitability of different assortment strategies is closely related to consumers’ showrooming behaviors (i.e., intra-product showrooming and inter-product showrooming). Whether or not the partial assortment strategy is more profitable than the full assortment strategy is determined by the intensity of consumer inter-product showrooming (or the weight of consumers’ valuation on the common attribute of different products). Third, our findings reveal that the expected return cost of pure-online shopping is critical to the retailer's omni-channel pricing and information service decisions. Our research provides implications for online retailers on how to benefit from offline information delivery and consumer showrooming behavior. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Assortment strategy; E-commerce; Omni-channel retailing; Physical showrooms; Showrooming","Costs; Electronic commerce; Information services; Mobile commerce; Profitability; Sales; Assortment strategy; Deployment strategy; Expected return; Information delivery; Mobile e-commerce; Omni-channel retailing; Physical showrooms; Showrooming; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076553567

However, the current big data analytics have conspicuous limitations, especially when dealing with information silos. In this paper, we synthesise existing researches on big data analytics and propose an integrated infrastructure for breaking down the information silos, in order to enhance supply chain performance. The analytic infrastructure effectively leverages rich big data sources (i.e. databases, social media, mobile and sensor data) and quantifies the related information using various big data analytics. The information generated can be used to identify a required competence set (which refers to a collection of skills and knowledge used for specific problem solving) and to provide roadmaps to firms and managers in generating actionable supply chain strategies, facilitating collaboration between departments, and generating fact-based operational decisions.

The aim of this paper is to investigate new correlation measures between HFLTSs and apply them in decision-making process. Firstly, the concepts of mean and hesitancy degree of hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements are introduced. Based on them, we address the drawbacks of the existing correlation measures between HFLTSs. Then, a new correlation coefficient between HFLTSs is established. Additionally, the hesitancy degree of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic correlation coefficient is proposed, which is composed by the upper and lower bounds of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic correlation coefficient. To show the applicability of the proposed correlation measures, a correlation coefficient-based method is developed for multiple criteria decision making in the cases that the weights of criteria are either known or unknown. A practical example concerning the strategic management of Sichuan liquor brands in China is given to validate the proposed method. It is verified that the proposed correlation coefficients between HFLTSs is more convincing than the existing ones and the developed correlation coefficient-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic MCDM with the weights of criteria being either completely known or unknown is applicable. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Correlation coefficient; Correlation measure; Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set; Multiple criteria decision making; Qualitative decision making; Weight-determining method","Behavioral research; Decision making; Correlation coefficient; Correlation measures; Fuzzy linguistics; Multiple criteria decision making; Qualitative decision making; Weight determining; Linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071590618

Firms' emphasis on observable aspects and negligence of the unobservable aspects are often labeled as greenwashing. This paper develops a game-theoretic model of CSR investment, in which consumers are socially minded, but they can observe only a subset of CSR initiatives. Two types of firms are considered: those that are driven solely by profit maximization and those that are socially responsible, motivated not only by profit, but also by a genuine concern for the social good. Our analysis examines how information transparency affects a firm's strategies and the social welfare, and we identify both positive and negative aspects of greenwashing. First, low transparency incentivizes a profit-driven firm to engage in greenwashing through observable investment. Greenwashing prevents consumers from making informed purchase decisions but raises overall CSR spending. Second, sufficiently high transparency eliminates greenwashing and can motivate a socially responsible firm to make extra observable investment under the threat of greenwashing on the part of a profit-driven firm. However, when transparency further increases, this extra investment diminishes. In addition, our paper studies the impacts of firms' budget constraint and consumers' bargaining power: Raising the budget and increasing consumers' bargaining power can both lead to an inferior social outcome. © 2020 INFORMS","Corporate social responsibility; Game theory; Greenwashing; Signaling","Budget control; Game theory; Investments; Profitability; Budget constraint; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Game-theoretic model; High transparency; Information transparency; Profit maximization; Purchase decision; Social outcomes; Transparency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082706522

This balanced panel study of 30 countries uses two single-equation models to investigate the impacts of natural resource abundance, international trade, financial development, trade openness and institutional quality on two proxies for economic development – economic growth and a human development index. The data spans from 1990 to 2016 and the impact is assessed in aggregate as well as the countries' level of development in three groups – Lower-middle, Upper-middle and High Income Countries. Four panel estimation approaches are used: Fixed Effects (FE), Random Effects (RE), Panel Fully Modified Least Squares (FMOLS) and Panel Dynamic Least Squares (DOLS). While natural resource abundance has a significantly positive impact on economic growth, a primarily negative and insignificant effect on human development exists. Interestingly, international trade and broad money have significantly negative impacts on economic development. Trade openness’ positive effect exceeds that of institutional quality. The findings suggest that the variables have a stronger influence on economic growth as compared to human development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic development; Economic growth; Financial development; Human development; Institutional quality; International trade; Natural resource abundance; Trade openness","Economic analysis; Finance; International trade; Natural resources; Random processes; Economic growths; Financial development; Human development; Institutional qualities; Resource abundance; Trade openness; Economic and social effects; economic development; economic growth; financial market; financial services; institutional development; international trade; natural resource; trade openness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079100471

This paper is the second part of a two-paper series. We present an empirically grounded research agenda that reflects the heterogeneity in industrial adoption and performance of Smart Maintenance. Focus groups and interviews with more than 110 experts from over 20 different firms were used to identify contingencies, responses, and performance implications of Smart Maintenance. The findings were transformed into a contingency model, providing the basis for a research agenda consisting of five principal areas: (1) environmental contingencies; (2) institutional isomorphism; (3) implementation issues related to change, investments and interfaces; (4) the four dimensions of Smart Maintenance; and (5) performance implications at the plant and firm level. The agenda can guide the field of industrial maintenance management to move from exploratory work to confirmatory work, studying the validity of the proposed concepts as well as the magnitude and direction of their relationships. This will ultimately help scholars and practitioners answer how Smart Maintenance can impact industrial performance. © 2019 The Authors","Digitalization; Industrial organization; Industry 4.0; Maintenance; Manufacturing; Smart manufacturing","Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Investments; Manufacture; Digitalization; Industrial environments; Industrial maintenance; Industrial organization; Industrial performance; Institutional isomorphism; Maintenance operations; Smart manufacturing; Maintenance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075452499

To measure innovation, we first utilize a survey to capture two types of firm practices, process improvement and new technology development for 331 firms. We then use patent data to further analyze new technology development for a broader sample of more than 2,000 publicly traded firms. We find that data analytics capabilities are more likely to be present and are more valuable in firms that are oriented around process improvement and that create new technologies by combining a diverse set of existing technologies than they are in firms that are focused on generating entirely new technologies. These results are consistent with the theory that data analytics are complementary to certain types of innovation because they enable firms to expand the search space of existing knowledge to combine into new technologies, as well as the theoretical arguments that data analytics support incremental process improvements. Data analytics appears less effective for developing entirely new technologies or creating combinations involving a few areas of knowledge, innovative approaches where there is either limited data or limited value in integrating diverse knowledge. Overall, our results suggest that firms that have historically focused on specific types of innovation-process innovation and innovation by diverse recombination-may receive the most benefits from using data analytics.

More importantly, the role agility plays in enhancing or not enhancing sustainability performance is not fully understood. Therefore, we explored the interaction effects between agile practices, sustainable practices, operational performance objectives and sustainable performance of organisations. A survey of higher carbon and energy intensive supply chains in the UK was carried out with a net 311 respondent organisations. The results show that there is a significant correlation between sustainable supply chain practices and agile practices. Also, the results indicate that agile practices do have a positive influence on both sustainability performance and operational performance objectives. Whilst the link between agility and operational performance is not new, what is new here is the connection between agile practices and sustainability performance. In addition, the findings show that sustainable supply chain practices predict both sustainability performance and operational performance. But more importantly, when these relationships are mediated by agile practices, the performance impacts of sustainability practices are enhanced. These findings question the usefulness of implementing sustainability practices within the supply chains when there is a lack of agile capabilities. In other words, the results suggest that agile capabilities are necessary conditions for maximizing the outcomes of implementation of sustainability practices. As such, managers who want to maximize the outcomes of their sustainability campaigns should consider concurrent implementation of sustainability practices and agile practices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Competitive performance objectives; Supply chain agility; Sustainability performance measures and organisational performance criteria; Sustainable supply chain","Supply chains; Surveys; Competitive performance; Operational performance; Organisational performance; Supply chain agility; Sustainability performance; Sustainability practices; Sustainable performance; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073923186

The task of selecting important engineering characteristics (ECs) in QFD is crucial and often involves multiple customer requirements (CRs). In this paper, a modified multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA) method based on cloud model theory (called C-MULTIMOORA) is developed to determine the ranking order of ECs in QFD. First, the linguistic assessments provided by decision makers are transformed into normal clouds and aggregated by the cloud weighted averaging operator. Then, the weights of CRs are determined based on a maximizing deviation method with incomplete weight information. Finally, the importance of ECs is obtained using the C-MULTIMOORA method. An empirical case conducted in an electric vehicle manufacturing organization is provided together with a comparative analysis to validate the advantages of our proposed QFD model. © 2017 The Authors.

In this paper, the impact of fiscal decentralization on China's environmental quality is investigated both theoretically and empirically. A neoclassical model is developed based on the primary characteristics of China's fiscal decentralization. Using provincial panel data for the period 1995-2015, a two-equation regression model is employed to empirically verify the three propositions of the theoretical model: (1) there exists an inverted-U shaped relationship between fiscal decentralization and GDP per capita; (2) fiscal decentralization is positively related to GDP per capita at the steady state; (3) there is an inverted-U shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve relationship between pollution emissions and economic growth. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","China; economic growth; environmental quality; fiscal decentralization; panel data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071947432

This task embodies typical modeling challenges faced in risk and behavior forecasting. Conventional machine learning requires data that is representative of the feature-target relationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, and revision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable, heterogeneous patterns such as trader behavior is challenging. Deep learning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical distributed representations of the data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior), it uncovers generative features that determine the target (e.g., trader's profitability), avoids manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g. dynamic market conditions). The results of employing a deep network for operational risk forecasting confirm the feature learning capability of deep learning, provide guidance on designing a suitable network architecture and demonstrate the superiority of deep learning over machine learning and rule-based benchmarks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Forecasting; Retail finance; Risk management","Commerce; Forecasting; Investments; Machine learning; Network architecture; Profitability; Risk management; Conventional machines; Distributed representation; Feature engineerings; Feature learning; Financial risk management; Operational risks; Provide guidances; Risk-taking behaviors; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076549323

In this paper, we discuss the application of data analytics in predicting first tier supply chain disruptions using historical data available to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Our methodology includes three phases: First, an exploratory phase is conducted to select and engineer potential features that can act as useful predictors of disruptions. This is followed by the development of a performance metric in alignment with the specific goals of the case study to rate successful methods. Third, an experimental design is created to systematically analyse the success rate of different algorithms, algorithmic parameters, on the selected feature space. Our results indicate that adding engineered features in the data, namely agility, outperforms other experiments leading to the final algorithm that can predict late orders with 80% accuracy. An additional contribution is the novel application of machine learning in predicting supply disruptions. Through the discussion and the development of the case study we hope to shed light on the development and application of data analytics techniques in the analysis of supply chain data.

Specifically, grounded in Resource Advantage Theory, we examine the effects of strategic orientation on the operational ambidexterity-performance link using data from 204 SMEs located in northern India. We first find that explorative and exploitative operational activities and their levels (average) have significant impacts on firms’ business performance. We also find that entrepreneurial- and market-oriented Indian SMEs place a greater emphasis on explorative operational activities; however, the impact of market orientation on exploitative operational activities is insignificant while that of entrepreneurial orientation on exploitative operational activities is highly significant. Despite insufficient resources to frequently undertake new projects, SMEs explore new opportunities to make profits, and also optimally utilize their existing resources and capabilities. Thus, the operations function of SMEs can ensure ambidexterity by focusing equally on existing resources and exploring new ones to seize market opportunities. We suggest that future research should investigate the relationships between operational ambidexterity and other orientations (e.g., technology, and learning), performance measures (e.g., customer satisfaction and loyalty), and contexts (e.g., large scale and non-for-profit companies). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Business performance; Entrepreneurial orientation; Exploitative operations; Explorative operations; Market orientation; Operational ambidexterity","Customer satisfaction; Industry 4.0; Profitability; Business performance; Entrepreneurial orientation; Exploitative operations; Explorative operations; Market orientation; Operational ambidexterity; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079635783

The extant literature about entrepreneurship recognizes new ventures as potential mechanisms for long-term development. Yet, there is a consensus on the lack of evidence, particularly for these countries. Drawing on institutional economics, this article explores the interrelationships among institutional environment, entrepreneurial activity, and economic growth. To this end, we use simultaneous-equation panel data models for a sample of 14 developing countries (78 observations) over the period of 2004–2012. The main findings suggest a causal chain running from institutions to opportunity entrepreneurship, which is linked to the economic growth of emerging economies. In particular, we find that institutional factors – such as the number of procedures to start a new business, private credit coverage , and access to communication– influence entrepreneurial activity driven by opportunity. Policy implications for developing countries could be derived in order to enhance their economic performance through entrepreneurial activity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Developing countries; Economic growth; Entrepreneurial activity; Institutions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077037737

Numerous research efforts have been directed to forecast the aforementioned two important project variables using different modeling techniques. However, no prior work is believed to have offered an integrated approach to estimating the performance of construction projects. This critical knowledge gap is compounded even more by the evolving complexities and uncertainties in today's construction industry. This paper creates a holistic framework to evaluate project progress and to predict its performance by incorporating a broad spectrum of inputs. The objectives are to (1) quantify the impacts of the risks related to the performance of projects in terms of cost and schedule; (2) formulate a holistic assessment model; and (3) correlate the developed system to predict cost and time at project completion. To this end, a multistep research methodology was utilized. First, for data collection, a survey was distributed and filled by 63 construction experts to study the effects of 25 performance risks that have shown to be the most important based on a meta-analysis of the literature in a previous study. Second, mathematical and statistical analysis techniques were used to develop a model that maps the investigated project risks to both cost and schedule performance. Steps included fitting parametric and nonparametric distributions, calculating cost overruns, verifying the model, and providing guidelines for using the proposed model. Third, for application, a hypothetical dataset was used to demonstrate the use of the model, its ability to deduce real-world behavior patterns, and associated limitations. The developed framework contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a novel model that improves project performance in terms of prediction, control, management, analysis, and decision making based on an individualized assessment of different risk indicators. This study is valuable for the construction industry because it allows all stakeholders to evaluate the performance of construction projects based on a list of variables, ultimately ensuring more effective and efficient delivery and execution of projects. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Construction industry; Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Project management; Risk assessment; Construction projects; Holistic frameworks; Individualized assessments; Integrated approach; Nonparametric distribution; Project characteristics; Project performance; Research methodologies; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081106733

The study identifies (i) operational benefits of SRAMODS including improved service quality and/or lower operational costs relative to automated mobility-on-demand services (AMODS) without shared rides; and (ii) challenges associated with operating SRAMODS. The study employs an agent-based stochastic dynamic simulation framework to model the operational problems of AMODS. The agents include automated vehicles (AVs), on-demand user requests, and a central AV fleet controller that can dynamically change the plans (i.e. routes and AV-user assignments) of AVs in real-time using optimization-based control policies. The agent-based simulation tool and AV fleet control policies are used to test the operational performance of AMODS under a variety of scenarios. The first set of scenarios vary user demand and a parameter constraining the maximum user detour distance. Results indicate that even with a small maximum user detour distance parameter value, allowing shared rides significantly improves the operational efficiency of the AV fleet, where the efficiency gains stem from economies of demand density and network effects. The second set of scenarios vary the mean and coefficient of variation of the curbside pickup time parameter; i.e. how long an AV must wait curbside at a user's pickup location before the user gets inside the AV. Results indicate that increases in mean curbside pickup time significantly degrade operational performance in terms of user in-vehicle travel time and user wait time. The study quantifies the total system (user plus fleet controller) cost as a function of mean curbside pickup time. Finally, the paper provides an extensive discussion of the implications of the quantitative analysis for public-sector transportation planners and policy-makers as well as for mobility service providers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Automated mobility-on-demand; Automated vehicles; Dynamic vehicle routing; Shared mobility; Shared rides; Simulation","Automation; Controllers; Efficiency; Fleet operations; Pickups; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Travel time; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Automated vehicles; Dynamic Vehicle Routing; On demands; Shared rides; Simulation; Service industry; car use; cost analysis; policy making; public transport; service quality; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079883644

Understanding factors that influence bike sharing ridership and accurate estimation of ridership play an important role in designing the system. Previous studies assume the relationship between predicting variables and the response variable are the same across the study area. However, this assumption may not be true, since the study area is usually wide and thus the relationship between predicting variabels and the response variable may change across space. As a result, semi-parametric geographically weighted regression (S-GWR) model is used to explore the spatially varying relationship. S-GWR is an extension of the GWR model. While in GWR model, all predicting variables are local variables with spatially varying relationship with the response variable, S-GWR model allows predicting variables to be either global or local, which is closer to reality. We also extend previous studies by differenciating members and 24-h pass users, as well as data related to trip production and trip attraction. Results show that S-GWR models fit the data better and the relationship between some predicting variables and response variable are local while other relationships are global. Ridership of both members and 24-h users are positively related to number of employed residents nearby and capacity of the station, and negatively related to distance to central business area and percent of low-income workers living nearby. Number of employments is only significantly associated with trip attraction. Among them, the variable capacity is always a global variable, with higher capacity associated with higher ridership. As a result, S-GWR model could be used to estimate the ridership of stations for accurate prediction and spatially varying relationship between ridership and influencing factors should be considered when designing bike sharing system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Direct modeling; Geographically weighted regression; Land use; Public bike; Transit","accuracy assessment; cycle transport; numerical model; public transport; regression analysis; spatial analysis; traffic congestion; travel behavior; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077710340

In the present research, we have proposed a framework for assessing the instrumentality of after-sales services on customer satisfaction. Kano model and SERVQUAL framework were used to categorize customer satisfaction elements. In addition, in order to address behavioral dissimilarities among customers, RFM clustering technique was used for analysing 243,180 customers of automobile after-sales services. Accordingly, dissatisfaction decrement index and satisfaction increment index were measured for every cluster separately. We identified a group of 21 quality elements and demonstrated the instrumentality and quality of these quality elements on customer satisfaction. RFM clustering technique is applied to address customer dissimilarities and we demonstrated the preferences and desires of customers in each cluster. While some papers have already identified the influential factors of after-sales services on customer satisfaction, this is for the first time that the instrumentality of after-sales services is being identified. Accordingly, this study demonstrates how different after-sales services quality elements affect customer satisfaction.

A concise framework is proposed to aid critical reflection in the design and reporting of stakeholder identification and engagement. This is grounded in a critical-systemic epistemology, and is informed by social identity theory. We illustrate the utility of the framework with an example of a problem structuring workshop, which was part of a green innovation project on the development of a technology for the recovery of rare metals from steel slag. The workshop was initially going to be designed to surface stakeholder views on the technology itself. However, it became apparent that a range of other strategic issues concerning the future of the site were going to impact on decision making about the use of steel slag. It therefore became important to evolve the agenda for the problem structuring, and this is where the critical-systemic approach made a difference. It enabled the workshop to be reframed as a community-based event looking at how the former steelworks site could be developed for new purposes. Evaluation of this problem structuring intervention revealed significant stakeholder learning about the issues needing to be accounted for, and a range of possible options for the development of the steelworks site were explored. The paper ends with a discussion of the utility of social identity theory for understanding the processes and outcomes of the workshop, and reflections are provided on its implications for operational research practice more generally. © 2019 The Authors","Community operational research; Critical systems thinking; Green innovation; Problem structuring methods; Stakeholder analysis","Decision making; Slags; Steel; Steel construction; Critical systems thinking; Green innovations; Operational research; Problem structuring methods; Stakeholder analysis; Metal recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076856247

By applying meta-analyses and SEM on 104 independent studies with 42,256 samples from existing empirical studies, we attempt to systematically reveal the relationship between privacy cognition and information disclosure. The results show that perceived privacy risks can significantly reduce personal information disclosure intention, as well as actual information disclosure behavior. However, privacy concerns only affect disclosure intention, but do not have a significant effect on actual information disclosure behavior. The study also verified that platform types have moderating effects on the privacy decision making of Internet users.

However, little quantitative research has been conducted under the BRI in the same framework. Therefore, by developing a data envelopment analysis optimisation model combined with the window analysis method, this paper investigates the energy performance of BRI countries for the period from 1995 to 2015, and evaluate the potential of energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction for each BRI country. The results show that, first, the average energy performance of 56 BRI countries is about 0.69, with evident difference across regions and countries. Specifically, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe and Central Asia, energy performance is relatively lower, and their averages are 0.59 and 0.60, respectively; in particular, Ukraine has the lowest energy performance among the 56 BRI countries (0.24); while the energy performance in Middle East and North Africa and South Asia appears relatively higher (0.80 and 0.89, respectively). Second, these 56 BRI countries have great energy saving potential, about 9.95 billion metric tonnes of oil equivalent from 1995 to 2015.

Hence, examining the critical success factors (CSFs) of SSM is vital. Although previous research mainly focused on the motives and implication of SSM, practical research that proposes how SSM can be implemented is still lacking. Therefore, this study fills the gap by identifying and ranking the CSFs of SSM with a theory-driven approach. The CSFs were developed through the theoretical lenses of five organisational theories, namely, stakeholder theory, resource-based view theory, relational-view theory, innovation diffusion theory, and contingency (fit) theory. Based on these theories, this study proposes stakeholders' focus, intra-firm management, inter-firm collaboration, new technology acceptance, and strategic fit as the CSFs of SSM. Further, 20 sub-criteria were identified to operationalise the CSFs. A survey questionnaire was pretested and then administered to 36 shipping companies in Vietnam. Thereafter, the obtained data were analysed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The findings show that the CSFs of SSM, in descending order of their importance, are (1) stakeholders' focus, (2) intra-firm management, (3) new technology acceptance, (4) inter-firm collaboration, and (5) strategic fit. Moreover, results of this study show that among the sub-criteria of SSM, the most important ones are primarily related to monetary resources and tangible infrastructures and equipment. Additionally, SSM implementation in shipping companies can be improved by addressing the needs of stakeholders and aligning SSM activities with shipping companies' strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Critical success factors; Relation view theory; Resource-based view theory; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable shipping management","Surveys; Critical success factor; Relation view theory; Resource-based view; Shipping management; Stakeholder theory; Ships",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072694162

The Chinese government, acknowledging this problem, enacted a series of laws and regulations concerning remanufacturing to help support the development of such industries. In this paper, we outline current situation and progress made in remanufacturing industry in China. Our investigation covers three perspectives, namely: the government policies, enterprises, and public awareness. Policies and the regulations related to remanufacturing are elaborated and evaluated in a chronological order. Advanced remanufacturing technologies as well as leading remanufacturing enterprises and national industrial parks are discussed. Public awareness on remanufacturing and citizens' participation in the environmental activities, both of which are beneficial to policy formulation and implementation, are surveyed and analyzed. Our analysis shows that industrial scale and annual production value of remanufacturing enterprises is improving with the new policies as well as capital and technical support from the government. Potential problems such as technical barriers, inefficiency, and lack of unified standards of remanufactured products still exist. Our survey of public awareness on remanufacturing shows that most respondents are unfamiliar with remanufactured products, but expressed their willingness and active support to promote the industry. Targeted recommendations and solutions are proposed for the government, enterprises, and public to promote and advance remanufacturing industry. © 2019","Pilot enterprise; Public awareness; Remanufacturing; Swap old for remanufacturing; Used product","Conservation; Natural resources; Surveys; End-of-life products; Environmental activities; Public awareness; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing; Resource conservation; Swap old for remanufacturing; Used product; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072394570

From the perspective of machine learning, the task of predicting customer churn can be presented as a binary classification problem. Using data on historic behavior, classification algorithms are built with the purpose of accurately predicting the probability of a customer defecting. The predictive churn models are then commonly selected based on accuracy related performance measures such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC). However, these models are often not well aligned with the core business requirement of profit maximization, in the sense that, the models fail to take into account not only misclassification costs, but also the benefits originating from a correct classification. Therefore, the aim is to construct churn prediction models that are profitable and preferably interpretable too. The recently developed expected maximum profit measure for customer churn (EMPC) has been proposed in order to select the most profitable churn model. We present a new classifier that integrates the EMPC metric directly into the model construction. Our technique, called ProfTree, uses an evolutionary algorithm for learning profit driven decision trees. In a benchmark study with real-life datasets from various telecommunication service providers, we show that ProfTree achieves significant profit improvements compared to classic accuracy driven tree-based methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Classification; Customer churn prediction; Evolutionary algorithm; Profit-based model evaluation","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Area under the ROC curve; Binary classification problems; Classification algorithm; Customer churn prediction; Misclassification costs; Model evaluation; Performance measure; Telecommunication service provider; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058042486

Following a qualitative approach, the findings are threefold: First, it is shown that the possibility of an entire SC integration based on new technologies is still at distance. Current burdens are the missing willingness to exchange far-reaching information even with long-term partners and the missing technological interface standards in order to enable a trouble-free communication alongside the SC. Second, the impact of Industry 4.0 and the Digital Transformation on decision making is greatly connected to information sharing. An increasing amount of decisions is prepared, recommended or even fully automated by information systems. However, usually, the human being still has the last word. Third, companies’ preparations for these impacts differ greatly. Whereas some companies rely on classical phase-based strategies and long-term visions, others do not have a long-term plan at all. © 2020, © 2020 Kedge Business School.","decision making; digital transformation; industry 4.0; information sharing; Supply Chain Management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078411366

Hence, the concept of a circular economy for plastics has been proposed as a sustainable approach to thrive both economy and our modern life. To implement a circular economy for plastics, an understanding of both individuals’ and organizations’ behaviors is needed since psychological effects often undermine technical solutions. We particularly focus on organizations’ behaviors since commercial plastic waste has not been thoroughly investigated compared to household plastic waste. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we assess the determinants of intentions and behaviors of 637 organizations in Belgium towards a circular economy for plastics. Our PLS-SEM analysis support that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of decision makers positively influence organizations’ intentions to implement best practices of plastic recycling. Furthermore, organizations’ intentions, perceived behavioral control, pressures, and enablers positively, whereas barriers negatively, influence organizations’ behaviors. Our study shows that most organizations have positive intentions, yet they seem to be failing in implementing best practices of plastic recycling due to some critical barriers. To overcome this intention-behavior gap and to attain a circular economy for plastics, our study suggests some measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Barriers; Circular economy; Plastic recycling; Plastic waste; PLS-SEM; Theory of Planned Behavior","Decision making; Elastomers; Least squares approximations; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Commercial plastics; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived behavioral control; Production and consumption; Psychological effects; Structural equation modeling; Technical solutions; Theory of Planned Behavior; Plastic recycling; plastic; environmental economics; plastic waste; policy implementation; pollution control; recycling; sustainability; waste management; Article; attitude; behavior; circular economy; controlled study; domestic waste; environmental decision making; environmental economics; human; partial least squares regression; plastic waste; recycling; structural equation modeling; Theory of Planned Behavior; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088964363

However, existing research has not clearly distinguished between the two liabilities, leaving it unclear how certain determinants differentially affect innovation performance in start-ups relative to older established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, in this study we investigate the impact of R&D investments, external knowledge sourcing and public R&D subsidies on innovation effectiveness in new versus older small firms. Employing panel data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey (CIS), we show that R&D investments have a lower contribution to the innovation performance of new ventures, compared to older small firms. In contrast, we find that external knowledge sourcing makes a higher contribution to the innovation performance of new compared to older small firms, but only in high-tech settings. However, we find no support for a differentiating effect of R&D subsidies in new versus established small firms. Effectively, our results highlight the limited effects of internal R&D investments and R&D policy instruments to promote the growth of innovative start-ups, while highlighting potential benefits of their openness to external sources of innovation. As such, these results have important implications for research, practices and policies that relate to innovation in new ventures and SMEs, while casting doubts on the effectiveness of some of the common strategy and policy instruments to stimulate performance in small innovative start-ups. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurship; External Knowledge Sourcing; Open innovation; Public policy; R&D resources; Smes; Spillovers","Engineering; Community innovation surveys; Differentiating effects; External knowledge; External sources; Innovation performance; Policy instruments; Potential benefits; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087183287

Planning for building materials reuse at the end-of-life of buildings is usually a difficult task because limited time are usually made available for building removal and materials recovery. In this study, deep learning models were developed for predicting the amount (in tons) of salvage and waste materials that are obtainable from buildings at the end-of-life prior to demolition. Datasets used for deep neural network model developments were extracted from 2280 building demolition records obtained from the practitioners in the UK Demolition Industry. The data was partitioned into training, testing and validation datasets in the ratio 8:1:1. Deep learning models were developed with a deep learning framework in R programming environment. The average R-squared value for the three deep learning models is 0.97 with Mean Absolute Error between 17.93 and 19.04. The models were evaluated with four scenarios of a case study building design.

(2017), and test the empirical relationship between environmental regulation and corporate financial performance using a fixed effects model. We find that: First, the Porter hypothesis per se is not supported in China's manufacturing sector, and environmental regulation often lowers manufacturing enterprises’ financial performance. Second, property rights protection has a positive impact on corporate financial performance, and a good property rights environment can mitigate the negative impact of environmental regulation on corporate financial performance by inducing corporate innovations. Third, property rights protection exhibits differential extent of its moderating effect on the relationship between environmental regulation and enterprise performance across different types of enterprises in terms of their ownership natures and the regional economic development level of their geographic locations. All of our main results survive several robustness checks that we performed. We confirm that Porter hypothesis in general is not applicable for China's manufacturing enterprises at present, but the moderating effect of property rights protection is steering the relationship between environmental regulations and corporate financial performance towards the path of Porter hypothesis, thereby in the future a win-win situation of environmental protection and corporate financial performance improvement may be achieved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate financial performance; Environmental regulation; Porter hypothesis; Property rights protection","Economics; Finance; Laws and legislation; Manufacture; Regional planning; Chinese manufacturing enterprise; Corporate financial performance; Empirical relationships; Enterprise performance; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing enterprise; Regional economic development; Shenzhen stock exchanges; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083878354

Considering energy use impacts and economic outputs together within the scope of a global-trade-linked, cradle-to-gate life cycle provides a comprehensive understanding of the environmental and economic impacts of industrial activities. In the first phase of the methodology, twenty multi-region input-output models were built to assess the energy and economic output nexus using a time series approach. Sixteen energy carriers were considered and aggregated in terms of renewable and nonrenewable energy use impacts. The second phase of the methodology focused on benchmarking U.S. manufacturing industries’ eco-efficiency, considering renewable to nonrenewable energy use and economic output. To accomplish this, data envelopment analysis (DEA) models were developed, and two benchmarking (eco-efficiency) measures were proposed, namely: renewability ratio (RR) and economic-output-induced renewability ratio (E-RR). The results indicated that the economic output of the manufacturing industries exhibited a steady, sustainable growth. Similar growth was observed in nonrenewable energy use. In contrast, the trend in renewable energy use was seen to be stagnant. No statistically significant improvement was observed in either the RR or E-RR measures, which were found to parallel the multi-region input-output analysis (MRIO) results. Although an increase in both the mean RR (0.3–0.4) and the mean E-RR (0.38–0.52) scores was recorded from 1995 to 2014, this was concluded to be unsatisfactory, since the majority of the industries’ eco-efficiency results were still below 0.5. Such an unsatisfactory result could be attributed to an imbalanced growth in nonrenewable energy use and economic output relative to renewable energy use. The findings of this study suggest that substantial policy changes are required immediately to shift the negative trend in renewable energy use to comply with UN Sustainability Development Goals 7 and 13. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Manufacturing; Multi-region input-output (MRIO) analysis; Renewability ratio; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Time series; Environmental and economic impacts; Input output analysis; Input-output; Manufacturing industries; Multi-region input-output models; Non-renewable energy use; Renewability ratio; Renewable energies; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077448211

Considering reference emission and cost learning effects, this study investigates a Stackelberg differential game, where a manufacturer acts as a leader and determines the wholesale price and emission reduction level and a retailer acts as a follower and sets the retail price. Equilibrium emission reduction and pricing strategies in cost- and revenue-sharing contracts are deduced from modelling these two collaboration modes. Results demonstrate that the manufacturer and the entire supply chain prefer the revenue-sharing contract rather than the cost-sharing one, whereas the retailer prefers only the wholesale price contract. High ratios in revenue-sharing contract lead to low emission levels and prices and hence benefit consumers. The environmental awareness of consumers and tax rates considerably affect the emission reduction, but learning effect does not. However, the high learning ability of the manufacturer can improve the performance of supply chain members. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; Cost learning; Differential game; Low-carbon supply chain; Pricing; Reference emissions","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Game theory; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chains; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Cost learning; Differential games; Environmental awareness; Low-carbon supply chains; Revenue sharing contracts; Stackelberg differential games; Wholesale price contract; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076830028

We proposed an integrated model by combining psychological distance theory and commitment-trust theory to examine the antecedents of consumer trust and relationship commitment in CBMC. We collected data from 699 global consumers on a CBMC platform and found the variables explain over 63% of buyer intentions. We confirm consumer trust as important to online commerce but also show that relational commitment is even more important to online consumer intention in the CBMC context. Seven influence factors are further confirmed to have impacts on commitment, trust and usage intentions.

However, the process by which emotion produces influence in online social media networks is relatively unknown. Previous works focus largely on sentiment classification and polarity identification but do not adequately consider the way emotion affects user influence. This research developed a novel framework, a theory-based model, and a proof-of-concept system for dissecting emotion and user influence in social media networks. The system models emotion-triggered influence and facilitates analysis of emotion-influence causality in the context of U.S. border security (using 5,327,813 tweets posted by 1,303,477 users). Motivated by a theory of emotion spread, the model was integrated in an influence-computation method, called the interaction modeling (IM) approach, which was compared with a benchmark using a user centrality (UC) approach based on social positions. IM was found to have identified influential users who are more broadly related to U.S. cultural issues. Influential users tended to express intense emotions of fear, anger, disgust, and sadness. The emotion trust distinguishes influential users from others, whereas anger and fear contributed significantly to causing user influence. The research contributes to incorporating human emotion into the data-information-knowledge-wisdom model of knowledge management and to providing new information systems artifacts and new causality findings for emotion-influence analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Border security; Causal modeling; Emotion; Emotion extraction; Influence modeling; Network analysis; Sentiment analysis; Social computing; Social media analytics","Computation theory; Electric network analysis; Knowledge management; Man machine systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Border security; Causal model; Emotion; Emotion extractions; Influence model; Social computing; Social media analytics; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054456877

The main findings illuminate the varying importance of three primary dimensions (i.e., service system analytics management capability, technology capability and personnel capability) and various respective subdimensions (i.e., service system planning, investment, coordination, control, connectivity, compatibility, modularity, technology management knowledge, technical knowledge, business knowledge and relationship knowledge) in developing overall analytics capabilities for a service system. The findings also confirm the strong mediating effects of three dynamic capabilities (i.e., market sensing, seizing and reconfiguring) in establishing competitive advantages. We critically discuss the implications of our findings for theory, methods and practice with limitations and future research directions. © 2020","Big data; Competitive advantage; Dynamic capability; Service analytics capability","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Human resource management; Investments; Competitive advantage; Dynamic capabilities; Future research directions; In-service systems; Management capabilities; Relationship knowledge; Resource-based view; Technology managements; Competition; competitiveness; data management; Delphi analysis; model validation; planning theory; service sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087340759

We use four categories of disruption risks in a supply chain: demand, process, supply, and environmental. Building upon dynamic capability theory, we examine the relationships among a firm's R&D investment, supply chain disruption risk drivers, supply chain performance, and firm performance, using data collected from manufacturing and service organizations in the U.S. Our findings show that a firm's R&D investment can be regarded as enhancing the firm's resilience capability. R&D investment significantly mitigates the effects of process disruption, supply disruption, and demand disruption on firm performance. R&D investment significantly mitigates the effects of process disruption and environmental disruption on supply chain performance.

To increase the likelihood of a sale, the business must recommend additional items that the customers may be unaware of or may find appealing. Recommender Engine (RE) is considered to be the preferred solution in these cases for reasons that include delivering relevant items, hence improving cart value, and boosting customer engagement. The paper describes a model for delivering real-time, personalised marketing information concerning the recommended items for online and offline customers, using a blend of selling strategies: up-selling, cross-selling, best-in-class-selling, needs-satisfaction-selling and consultative-selling. The model further defines the e-marketplace by clustering items, customers and unique selling proposition (USP), and then gathering, storing, and processing transactional data, and displaying personalised marketing information to support the customer in their decision-making process, even when purchasing from large item spaces. An experimental study using a quantitative research methodology was conducted in a mid-size healthcare retailer, based out of India, to determine the tangible benefits. The model was tested with 100 online customers and, with the adoption of the proposed methodology, the results indicated growth in average monthly revenue (33.49%), Average Order Value (AOV) (32.79%) and Items per Order (IPO) (1.93%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Customer relationship management; Personalized digital marketing; Recommender engine","decision making; development strategy; experimental study; marketing; research method; retailing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064105972

Countries have implemented agricultural subsidy policies with a focus on food security and environmental protection. Agricultural production is risky and uncertain, influencing the efficiency of agricultural subsidies. This study develops a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of production uncertainties on the efficiency of agricultural subsidy policies under the double constraints of food security and environmental protection. The basic model is investigated under six different conditions, and expanded research also is presented. Our models show that uncertainty, including output, cost, and price uncertainties, and technology conversion efficiency significantly affects the efficiency of agricultural subsidies. Under high technology conversion efficiency, output-oriented subsidies are appropriate for food security and environmental protection goals. Policymakers should take both uncertainty and production efficiency into consideration when choosing between input-oriented and output-oriented subsidy policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Efficiency; Environmental protection; Food security; Subsidy; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073027225

Using comparative case-study analysis, this paper examines the extent to which nature-driven stewardship initiatives recognize and redress inequalities. We compare two urban contexts that have undergone significant societal transformations over the last two to three decades: Sofia and Cape Town. The comparison shows how nature-driven stewardship initiatives differentially address deeper roots of environmental, social and racial privilege shaped significantly by post-socialist and post-apartheid transition contexts. Instead of assuming a homogenous ideal of urban nature and focusing on questions of the distribution of urban nature and its access, this paper finds it is important to consider the kinds of social relations that are required to both shape decision-making processes and generate meaningful and diverse values and ways of relating to nature in the city. Furthermore, it finds that inclusive nature-based solution governance recognizes and redresses both inequalities in access and inequalities that perpetuate dominant views about what nature is and for whom nature is produced and maintained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cities in transition; Governance; Inclusive; Inequality; Nature; Stewardship; Urban","comparative study; decision making; governance approach; social exclusion; social participation; social problem; urban area; Bulgaria; Sofia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089831622

Nevertheless, it is argued that state-of-the-art studies focus excessively on producing quantitative performances superior to existing models, by playing “the Kaggle game.” Hence, the field requires more effort in solving new problems and proposing novel approaches and architectures. We claim that one of the promising and constructive efforts would be to design transparent and accountable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for text analytics. By doing so, we can enhance the applicability and problem-solving capacity of the system for real-world decision support. It is widely accepted that deep learning models demonstrate remarkable performances compared to existing algorithms. However, they are often criticized for being less interpretable, i.e., the “black box.” In such cases, users tend to hesitate to utilize them for decision-making, especially in crucial tasks. Such complexity obstructs transparency and accountability of the overall system, potentially debilitating the deployment of decision support systems powered by AI. Furthermore, recent regulations are emphasizing fairness and transparency in algorithms to a greater extent, turning explanations more compulsory than voluntary. Thus, to enhance the transparency and accountability of the decision support system and preserve the capacity to model complex text data at the same time, we propose the Explaining and Visualizing Convolutional neural networks for Text information (EVCT) framework. By adopting and ameliorating cutting-edge methods in NLP and image processing, the EVCT framework provides a human-interpretable solution to the problem of text classification while minimizing information loss. Experimental results with large-scale, real-world datasets show that EVCT performs comparably to benchmark models, including widely used deep learning models. In addition, we provide instances of human-interpretable and relevant visualized explanations obtained from applying EVCT to the dataset and possible applications for real-world decision support. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Class activation mapping; Convolutional neural network; Explainable artificial intelligence; Machine learning interpretability","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cutting; Decision making; Deep learning; Image processing; Large dataset; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Problem solving; Text processing; Transparency; Decision supports; Explosive growth; Information loss; NAtural language processing; Real-world datasets; State of the art; Text classification; Text information; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084200807

In this paper, the effect of the current deposit-refund scheme in promoting recycling is explored and some improvement suggestions are proposed. The results show that: 1) the current deposit-refund scheme can increase the collection rate of used EV batteries. However, the effect is very limited. 2) The subsidy fund is at surplus under the current collection subsidy level. In order to further promote the collection of used EV batteries, the collection subsidy could be increased within a certain range. 3) With continuous progress in recycling technology and gradual enhancement of consumers’ environmental awareness, collection subsidy level can be decreased to avoid the deficiency of collection subsidy fund while maintaining the collection rate at similar level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Deposit-refund scheme; Electric vehicle battery; Game theory; System dynamics","Deposits; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Environmental technology; Game theory; Recycling; System theory; Collection rates; Current collection; Efficient recycling; Electric vehicle batteries; Environmental awareness; Recycling technology; System Dynamics; System dynamics simulation; Automotive batteries; econometrics; electric vehicle; energy policy; game theory; numerical model; policy implementation; recycling; subsidy system; article; awareness; China; consumer; game; human; recycling; simulation; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080043206

Past data envelopment analysis (DEA) studies on energy system efficiency have often ignored the dynamics of each process of the system individually. Here a network-based DEA method is built, which considers the interrelationships of the operations to determine the efficacy of the system. For assessing the performance over successive periods, with time-based dependencies between the successive periods, a dynamic DEA (DDEA) model is proposed. In DDEA, a linear combination of the efficiencies in successive periods is used as the complement of the system. The network-based and dynamic features of the created model enable measuring the performance of each sub-system process and the entire system in multi-period planning horizons simultaneously. These features make the DEA model identify changes in system efficiencies so much better than the current approaches. The created model is comprehensively implemented in the Iranian electricity sector using real data. Based on the findings, the efficiencies of power generation and transmission sectors are decreasing while the distribution performance is increasing. The proposed model could be applied to electricity generation systems in other countries as well. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Dynamic; Efficiency assessment; Electricity generation systems; Energy; Network","Complex networks; Data envelopment analysis; Electric power generation; Dynamic features; Dynamic network; Electricity sector; Electricity-generation system; Linear combinations; Planning horizons; Power generation and transmission; System efficiency; Power quality; data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; electricity generation; energy efficiency; numerical model; power generation; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089747476

Firms are now required to report not only their operations' carbon emissions but also their suppliers'. This research explores the institutional pressures emanating from buyers and industry peers driving supplier firms to disclose high-quality carbon emission publicly—our concept of carbon transparency. Many firms are increasingly adopting incentives to engage their employees in corporate climate change programs. Thus, we study the impact of three institutional pressures—coercive, mimetic, and normative—and examine when these pressures are more (or less) effective for driving supplier carbon transparency depending on the presence of climate change incentives. We used Carbon Disclosure Project's supply chain program (CDP-SCP) as our research context. To gain deeper insight into the CDP-SCP as well as the drivers and challenges of suppliers' carbon transparency, we conducted interviews with three CDP officials, three CDP-SCP members (i.e., buyers), and six CDP-SCP participants (i.e., suppliers). To test our hypotheses, we used a unique dataset from CDP-SCP and complemented it with four other archival datasets for a sample of 835 suppliers operating in 41 countries during the 2013–2015 period. The results show that suppliers without climate change incentives are more vulnerable to coercive and mimetic pressures, whereas suppliers with climate change incentives are more receptive to normative pressure in terms of how much carbon transparency they exhibit. Thus, our study proposes an extensive concept of supplier carbon transparency, provides a comprehensive analysis of its external/internal drivers, and reveals when institutional pressures are more/less effective in eliciting supplier carbon transparency. This research also provides strategies for how buyers, suppliers, and CDP can foster more carbon transparency in supply chains. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","buyer–supplier relationship; CDP; climate change; institutional pressure; transparency","Carbon; Sales; Statistical tests; Supply chains; Transparency; Carbon Disclosure Project; Carbon emissions; Comprehensive analysis; Global supply chain; Institutional pressures; Managerial incentives; Mimetic pressures; Normative pressures; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083717726

Using a vector error-correction model, the study finds that in the long run, both entrepreneurship and innovation stimulate economic growth. In the short run, strong causal links exist but are not always uniform. The results reveal that Eurozone countries should indeed base their growth strategies on policies that promote innovation and policies that create incentives for entrepreneurship. © 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling","Economic growth; Entrepreneurship; Eurozone countries; Innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081278445

As the introduction of Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) usually implies in high capital expenditures and requires a more skilled labor force, such understanding gains relevance when considering hospitals in emerging economies, more likely to be resource-constrained. This study examines the effect of five contingency factors on the adoption of H4.0 technologies and associated barriers to H4.0 adoption in emerging economies; they are: hospital's ownership and age, number of employees, number of inpatient beds, and functionality (teaching hospital or not). The analysis is based on a transnational survey with 159 middle and senior managers from 16 hospitals, located in Brazil, India, Mexico and Argentina. Results indicate that contingencies do affect both H4.0 technologies adoption and associated barriers although not homogeneously in terms of effect, being more prominent on technologies’ adoption than on barriers to H4.0 implementation. Our study sheds light on these relationships, providing hospitals’ managers a means to anticipate potential issues and handle eventual difficulties inherent to the context in which they are inserted. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Barriers; Contingency factors; Digital technologies; Healthcare 4.0; Survey","Health care; Managers; Surveying; Surveys; Barriers; Capital expenditures; Contingency factors; Digital technologies; Emerging economies; High complexity; Senior managers; Skilled labor force; Hospitals; contingent valuation; expenditure; health care; health services; health survey; hospital sector; skilled labor; technology adoption; Argentina; Brazil; India; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082849521

We show that SA of tweets has potential as a real-time barometer of public sentiment towards negotiating outcomes to inform government decision-making. Despite the increasing need for information on collective preferences regarding possible negotiating outcomes, negotiators have been slow to capitalise on BDA. Through SA on a corpus of 13,018,367 tweets on defined Brexit hashtags, we illustrate how SA can provide a platform for decision-makers engaged in international negotiations to grasp collective preferences. We show that BDA and SA can enhance decision-making and strategy in public policy and negotiation contexts of the magnitude of Brexit. Our findings indicate that the preferred or least preferred Brexit outcomes could have been inferred by the emotions expressed by Twitter users. We argue that BDA can be a mechanism to map the different options available to decision-makers and bring insights to and inform their decision-making.

The advent of self-driving vehicles is likely to facilitate the growth of car-sharing by addressing a couple of the current barriers, including limited dedicated parking and non-competitive access times. Despite the growing importance of this topic, however, the patterns emerging in the market penetration of automated vehicles in car-sharing programs have not received much attention in the literature because of the relative newness of the automated vehicle technologies enabling them. Towards addressing this research gap in this increasingly important area, this paper presents the results of an Australian survey with a focus on consumer preferences towards car-sharing. A stated preference (SP) methodology was adopted to elicit consumers’ valuation of specified mode-choice related factors. In particular, vehicle self-driving capability, a factor rarely examined in the literature, was provided as an option to participants in the SP survey. To increase the realness of the experiment, SP tasks were pivoted from respondents’ most recent trips. The travel preferences data were analyzed using a random parameter (mixed) logit model. To explore preference heterogeneity, socio-demographic and other factors were interacted with alternative-specific attributes, and their influences on marginal utilities were extracted using simulation analysis. Preference heterogeneity across individuals towards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) was identified. Consistent with the literature, consumers’ experience of using car-sharing appears to have significant influence on household mode choices, increasing the probability of using a diversified mode tools (e.g., TWS and Taxi) and decreasing the likelihood of choosing to use privately owned travel tools, such as private car. Although it has been argued in the literature that females, non-drivers, and the elderly are the most likely to benefit from SAVs, the results of this study reveal that these user groups in fact hold negative opinions about SAVs. The findings highlight the challenges policymakers may encounter in maximizing the social and individual benefits of SAVs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Car-sharing (CS); Mixed logit; Mode choice; Random parameter; Self-driving; Shared automated vehicles (SAVs); Stated preference","Automation; Commerce; Logistic regression; Surveys; Taxicabs; Automated vehicles; Mixed logit; Mode choice; Random parameters; Self drivings; Stated preferences; User experience; car use; discrete choice analysis; heterogeneity; logit analysis; transportation mode; travel behavior; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076979268

The sector's sustainable growth depends on how firms might best reduce the financial constraints, such as high costs of external financing involved in cleaner production. To address this challenge, this study explores how the financing behavior of Chinese firms impacts production-generated pollution by illustrating financial constraint mechanisms. We argue that cash holdings significantly finance pollution control investment with a marginal contribution of 0.1%, which can be explained by the low financial cost of cash holdings. Furthermore, our empirical results indicate that a) financially-constrained firms are more likely to use cash to smooth financial constraints to finance pollution control investment; b) internal cash flow only supports pollution investment in financially-constrained firms, i.e., firms with a poor ability to pay debt and higher debt costs prefer to use cash to smooth their pollution control investment activities. Notably, debt significantly curbs the high cost of pollution control investment at a general level of 0.04%. In addition, the effect of cash-backing pollution control investment is particularly compelling in industries that are more pollution- and labor-intensive, with respective marginal contributions of 0.14% and 0.63%. Finally, we find that fixed asset investments and intangible asset investments crowd out pollution control investment at 0.11% and 0.52%, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cash holdings; Financial constraints; Financial cost theory; Investment order; Pollution control","Environmental regulations; Investments; Manufacture; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Cash holdings; Cleaner production; External financings; Financial constraints; Financial costs; Fixed asset investments; Manufacturing sector; Marginal contribution; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074159097

Traditional stick-built construction and modular construction differ in many aspects including design, engineering, collaboration requirements, logistics, and others. Available research efforts tried to study and model the complex modular construction processes. However, they seemed to fall short in investigating modular construction processes in a comprehensive and holistic manner. In effect, the currently used decision-making models and processes for modular construction do not necessarily reflect the diverse and multiple interconnected and associated factors. This paper develops a comprehensive list of decision factors as well as determines future research needs for modular construction. As such, the authors (1) conducted a systematic literature review and analysis of modular construction studies that were conducted between 2009 and 2019, (2) highlighted the broad factors affecting decision-making in modular construction projects, and (3) utilized social network analysis (SNA) to quantitatively identify the literature gaps and strengths and create a roadmap for the factors that need further investigation. This paper identified 50 decision factors affecting the various modular construction operations in the construction industry. Consequently, it was revealed that there are some understudied decision factors, including those related to legal and regulatory considerations, material and construction waste management, green practices, as well as commissioning and testing. Further, it was shown that there is an explicit absence of the decision models and frameworks that simultaneously incorporate all the identified decision factors. Accordingly, this study provides a substantiated foundation for comprehensive decision-making processes for modular construction. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Commerce; Construction industry; Modular construction; Waste management; Well testing; Compound annual growth rates; Construction operations; Construction projects; Construction waste managements; Decision making models; Decision making process; Regulatory considerations; Systematic literature review; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091041335

Crossing these boundaries with data on 1,324 activist hedge fund campaigns between 2000 and 2016, we find a clear trade-off associated with hedge fund activism: benefits are shareholder-centric and short-lived, reflected in immediate increases in market value and profitability; however, these increases come at a mid- to long-term cost to other stakeholders, captured by decreases in operating cash flow, investment spending, and social performance. We discuss our findings from a multi-stakeholder perspective to move beyond a polarizing debate about the merits of hedge fund activism. Managerial Summary: With hedge fund activism on the rise, determining the consequences of equity ownership by activist hedge funds on target companies' short-term and long-term financial and social performance takes on central importance. In this study, we find hedge fund campaigns are associated with three broad sets of outcomes for targeted companies: (a) an immediate but short-lived increase in market value and profitability, and an immediate and long-lived decline in operating cash flow; (b) decreases in number of employees, operating expenses, R&D spending, and capital expenditures; and (c) the suppression of corporate social performance. By capturing the range of positive and negative effects on target companies, our study presents the competing implications of hedge fund activism on business and society. © 2020 The Authors.

CE adoption in emerging economies facilitates in substantial economic growth through appropriate utilisation of energy and material resources across manufacturing industries. This study identifies CE indicators in the context of an emerging economy. The study further develops a framework for the adoption of CE and tests it through a hybrid Best Worst Method and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory approach. The framework is validated through an Indian manufacturing case organisation. While Best Worst Method computes the CE related indicator weights, Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory analyses the inter-relationship among indicators. Disparate CE related indicators, e.g. strategic, managerial, informational and technological, supply chain and organisational, influence the CE adoption in an emerging economy context. The findings reveal that the strategic and managerial indicators have the strongest influence on developing other indicators. The causal digraph and relationship diagram assist the practitioners in predicting the inter-relationship of indicators in CE adoption.

The purpose of this paper is to highlight a region of manufacturing firms in the Midwest USA to investigate the role of firm size, access to funds and industry type on decision to invest in and deploy various Industry 4.0 technologies. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was developed, piloted, and deployed to manufacturing companies located in the Midwest USA, specifically, Indiana, USA. A total of 138 manufacturing firms completed the full survey. The survey participants were requested to rank order the various technology categories with respect to previous historical spending, workforce capabilities and anticipated return on investment. The survey was supplemented with publically available data. Due to the use of rank-order data to identify Industry 4.0 priorities, a non-parametric analysis was completed using the Kruskall Wallis test. Findings: The findings suggest that manufacturers with less than 20 employees and/or less access to funds (sales less than $10m) prioritize digital factory floor technologies (e.g. technology directly impacting productivity, quality and safety of manufacturing processes). Larger manufacturers with 20 or more employees and/or access to more funds (sales greater than or equal to $10m) prioritize enterprise support operations technologies. Originality/value: Research studies and reports tend to lump manufacturing’s perspective of Industry 4.0 into one homogenous group, and rarely acknowledge the limited participation of “smaller” Small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for the far majority of manufacturing firms in the USA. The value of this study is on the “novelty of approach,” in that the data collection and analysis focuses on heterogeneity of manufacturing firms with respect to size, access to funds and industry type. The findings and recommendations are beneficial and relevant to organizations supporting Industry 4.0 efforts through workforce development and economic development initiatives. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Strategy; Technology implementation","Decision making; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Personnel; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Manufacturing companies; Non-parametric analysis; Small and medium sized enterprise; Strategy; Technology implementation; Technology investments; Uncertainty and complexity; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075811826

We proposed a mixed integer programming model to assign passengers to seats on an airplane in a manner that will respect two types of social distancing. One type of social distancing refers to passengers being seated far enough away from each other. The metric for this type of social distancing is how many passengers are seated so close to each other as to increase the risk of infection. The other type of social distancing refers to the distance between seat assignments and the aisle. That distance influences the health risk involved in passengers and crew members walking down the aisle. Corresponding metrics for both health risks are included in the objective function. To conduct simulation experiments, we define different scenarios distinguishing between the relative level of significance of each type of social distancing. The results suggest the seating assignments that best serve the intention of the scenarios. We also reformulate the initial model to determine seat assignments that maximize the number of passengers boarding an airplane while practicing social distancing among passengers. In the last part of this study, we compare the proposed scenarios with the recommended middle-seat blocking policy presently used by some airlines to keep social distancing among passengers. The results show that the proposed scenarios can provide social distancing among seated passengers similar to the middle-seat blocking policy, while reducing the number of passengers seated close to the aisle of an airplane. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Airplane boarding; Airplane seat assignment; COVID-19; Mixed integer programming; SARS-CoV-2; Social distancing","air transportation; airline industry; comparative study; COVID-19; health risk; infectious disease; numerical model; policy approach; simulation; software; SARS coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090598572

In particular, production processes that are relatively high emitting will be more sensitive to the uncertain costs of emitting carbon dioxide and might further reflect productive inefficiencies. We employ a productive efficiency model to evaluate firms' carbon emission levels relative to those of best-practice (efficient) peers with comparable production structures. By accounting for total factor productivity and sector-relative performance aspects, this measure of carbon efficiency helps to quantify and rank firms' relative dependence on carbon in the production process. We investigate the impact of carbon efficiency on various financial performance outcomes and evaluate the role of general resource efficiency in explaining these impacts. Using an international sample of 1572 firms over the years 2009–2017, we find superior financial performance in carbon-efficient (best-practice) firms. On average, a 0.1 higher carbon efficiency is associated with a 1.0% higher profitability and 0.6% lower systematic risk. While carbon efficiency closely relates to resource efficiency, it also has distinct financial performance impacts, particularly lowering systematic risk. Overall, our findings suggest that carbon-efficient production can be valuable from both operational and risk management perspectives. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Directional distance function; Financial performance; Total factor productivity","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; finance; firm size; profitability; spatiotemporal analysis; total factor productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085603202

We define a new source of bias related to incompleteness in real time inputs, which may result from strategic behavior by agents. We theorize that domain expertise of users can complement ML by mitigating this bias. Our observational and experimental analyses in the patent examination context support this conjecture. In the face of “input incompleteness,” we find ML is biased toward finding prior art textually similar to focal claims and domain expertise is needed to find the most relevant prior art. We also document the importance of vintage-specific skills, and discuss the implications for artificial intelligence and strategic management of human capital. Managerial Summary: Unleashing the productivity benefits of machine learning (ML) technologies in the future of work requires managers to pay careful attention to mitigating potential biases from its use. One such bias occurs when there is input incompleteness to the ML tool, potentially because agents strategically provide information that may benefit them. We demonstrate that in such circumstances, ML tools can make worse predictions than the prior technology vintages. To ensure productivity benefits of ML in light of potentially strategic inputs, our research suggests that managers need to consider two attributes of human capital—domain expertise and vintage-specific skills. Domain expertise complements ML by correcting for the (strategic) incompleteness of the input to the ML tool, while vintage-specific skills ensure the ability to properly operate the technology. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bias; complementarities; domain expertise; human capital; machine learning","Learning systems; Managers; Productivity; bias; complementarities; Domain expertise; Experimental analysis; Experimental evidence; Human capitals; Strategic Behavior; Strategic management; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082960429

Various key factors were identified from extant literature and subsequently validated from 28 industry experts. Further, cause and effect relationships among the factors are examined by applying Grey-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique. The results indicate that ‘Governmental regulations and support’ (R–C = 1.14), ‘Increased customer awareness on environment protection’ (R–C = 0.65) and ‘Implementation of information technologies’ (R–C = 0.34) are the most important causal factors.

We use psychology theory to classify the emotional content of social media-based word of mouth, which we refer to as ESWOM. We examine whether ESWOM influences institutional investors' stockholdings differentially based on investor type and if institutional investors' stockholdings mediate the relation between ESWOM and firm value. We identify eight types of ESWOM by linguistically interpreting web scrapings of millions of social media posts on 38 corporate brands for the 2007-2015 period. We find differential effects of ESWOM on stockholdings of institutional investors. Dedicated and quasi-index institutional investors increase their stockholdings in response to increases in positive ESWOM such as joy and trust. Transient investors decrease their stockholdings in response to increases in negative ESWOM such as anger, disgust, and fear. Competitive intensity and intangible asset intensity influence these results. Path analysis indicates that ESWOM influences firm abnormal stock returns and idiosyncratic risk both directly and indirectly through its effects on institutional investors' stockholdings. These findings support our hypothesis that investors' responses to customer sentiment vary based on whether they follow longterm or short-term investment strategies. Our research highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneous preferences of institutional investors and their use of social media information for decision making. © 2019 INFORMS.","Firm value; Institutional stockholdings; Risk; Social media; Word of mouth","Decision making; Investments; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Risks; Social networking (online); Differential effect; Firm value; Institutional investors; Institutional stockholdings; Investment decisions; Social media; Social media informations; Word of mouth; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080034039

Using a vector error-correction model, the study examines the underlying short-run and long-run relationships for the above variables. The empirical analysis shows that in the long run, venture capital investment, ICT diffusion, and innovation diffusion have significant impacts on economic growth in Europe. However, in the short run, the direction of the causality varies depending on the specific measures of ICT diffusion and innovation diffusion that are utilized. Results from this study provide valuable insights into the types of policies that will contribute to sustainable economic growth in Europe. © 2019 University of New Orleans","economic growth; European countries; ICT diffusion; innovation diffusion; venture capital investment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066636186

The three oil shocks are disentangled using the recent procedure of Ready (2018), which allows one to identify oil supply, oil demand, and oil risk shocks. Using daily data covering the period between January 2, 1997 and January 30, 2019, the results reveal a weak average of the total dynamic connectedness between the oil price shocks and the gold returns, manifesting sudden upsurges during turmoil periods. We also find that the oil supply shocks are the dominant transmitter of the time-varying spillovers from oil to the gold market, followed by the oil risk shocks, while the oil demand shocks are a net receiver of the spillovers from the gold market. Performing further analysis, we did not find any asymmetric patterns of dynamic connectedness between the oil shocks and the gold returns, regardless of the signs of the oil shocks. Besides, the results indicate a significant effect of the economic policy uncertainty on the connectedness between the oil shocks and the gold market in both the static and regime-switching framework.

Food waste is a multi-sectoral issue and must be addressed as such, by ensuring policymakers, practitioners, and consumers are equipped with the relevant knowledge and understanding of the importance of sustainable food waste practices. By exploring current attitudes and understanding of this topic amongst consumers, a lack of education about the importance of this issue has been identified as a barrier to carrying out sustainable practices at the household level, along with excess packaging, cultural norms of overconsumption and inappropriate social marketing. In contrast, a number of enablers, including social pressures, access to appropriate facilities and encouragement from media advertisements appear to have been highly influential in infringing on the consciousness of consumers. Investigating these enablers and barriers has allowed a number of potential interventions to be identified, with the intention of addressing this issue using a multifaceted approach and encouraging society to carry out sustainable food waste practices in the future. © 2020","Food waste; Food waste management; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable lifestyles","Contrast media; Economic and social effects; Food waste; Marketing; Cultural norms; Household level; Multi-faceted approach; Policy makers; Social marketings; Social pressures; Societal impacts; Sustainable practices; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088652140

For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model – the ”Rippled Newsvendor” – with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and ”wear-and-tear” (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk. Furthermore, we show that the type of risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the supply chain and inventory system, impact risk severity differently. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian networks; Inventory management; Newsvendor; Ripple effect; Supply chain risk propagation; Supply chain risk structure","Bayesian networks; Economic and social effects; Inventory control; Probability distributions; Supply chains; Conditional probability distributions; Inventory management; Newsvendors; Optimal ordering policy; Ripple effects; Structural characteristics; Supply chain risk; Supply-chain disruptions; Risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082822675

Recently, corporate management has encountered stakeholder pressure to disclose more information about their carbon profile and their plans to improve it. They have also been challenged to find the appropriate strategy for carbon disclosures, requiring an understanding of the costs and benefits of both carbon improvement initiatives and the reporting of them. Using a unique data set that contains firms listed on the FTSE 350 index on the London Stock Exchange market from 2009 to 2015, we apply the event study method to examine market reaction to carbon disclosures. The results show that investors respond significantly negatively to carbon disclosure announcements via Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) of FTSE 350 firms. Moreover, for firms working in carbon-intensive industries, investors react to carbon disclosure announcements in a more significantly negative way compared with the main sample. We also find that the study's main findings are driven by the smaller FTSE 350 firms. Furthermore, a subsample of observations for the financial crisis period of 2007–2008 was analyzed to explore the examined relationship during the crisis. In contrast, a significant positive market reaction to carbon disclosure was found for the 2007–2008 crisis period. Our study's findings offer fresh insight and updated policy implications for investors, management and sustainability institutions.

Thus, we ask: “What is the optimal choice of revenue model?” Using a novel theory-building method combining machine learning and multi-case theory building, we unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store. Our primary theoretical contribution is a framework of high-performing revenue model-activity system configurations. Our core insight is the fit between value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activities) at the heart of successful business models. Contrastingly, low-performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort). Overall, we contribute a theoretically accurate and empirically grounded view of successful business models using a pioneering method for theory building using large, quantitative data sets.

We combine machine learning with multiple-case deep-dives to unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store, a significant setting in the digital economy.

This study follows a five-stage method to understand these barriers to AV adoption. First, based on a literature review followed by discussions with experts, ten barriers are identified. Second, the opinions of eighteen experts from industry and academia regarding inter-relations between these barriers are recorded. Third, a multicriteria decision making technique, the grey-based Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Grey-DEMATEL), is applied to characterize the structure of relationships between the barriers. Fourth, robustness of the results is tested using sensitivity analysis. Fifth, the key results are depicted in a causal loop diagram (CLD), a systems thinking approach, to comprehend cause-and-effect relationships between the barriers. The results indicate that the lack of customer acceptance (LCA) is the most prominent barrier, the one which should be addressed at the highest priority. The CLD suggests that LCA can be mitigated by addressing two other prominent and more tangible barriers – lack of industry standards and the absence of regulations and certifications. The study's contribution lies in demonstrating that the barriers to AV adoption do not exist in isolation but are linked with each other in overlapping loops of cause and effect relationships. These insights can help different stakeholders in prioritizing their endeavors to expedite AV adoption. From the methodological perspective, this is the first study in the transportation literature that integrates Grey-DEMATEL with systems thinking. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicle; Barriers; Causal loop diagram; Grey-DEMATEL","Decision making; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; System theory; Barriers; Causal loop diagrams; Cause-and-effect relationships; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratories; DEMATEL; Infrastructure development; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making technique; Autonomous vehicles; decision making; stakeholder; technology adoption; transportation development; transportation infrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078702418

Recently, a web survey was developed to provide an opportunity to share thousands of sexual harassment experiences in academia. Using an efficient approach, this study collected and investigated more than 2,000 sexual harassment experiences to better understand these unwanted advances in higher education. This paper utilized text mining to disclose hidden topics and explore their weight across three variables: harasser gender, institution type, and victim's field of study. We mapped the topics on five themes drawn from the sexual harassment literature and found that more than 50% of the topics were assigned to the unwanted sexual attention theme. Fourteen percent of the topics were in the gender harassment theme, in which insulting, sexist, or degrading comments or behavior was directed towards women. Five percent of the topics involved sexual coercion (a benefit is offered in exchange for sexual favors), 5% involved sex discrimination, and 7% of the topics discussed retaliation against the victim for reporting the harassment, or for simply not complying with the harasser.

Design/methodology/approach: The study resorted to structured questionnaire to collect data from 158 manufacturing firms from different industries, and partial least square–structural equation modelling is used to test all hypothesized relationships. Findings: The results indicate that green manufacturing has a positive significant impact on social, economic and environmental performance. However, firm reputation and operational competitiveness were found not to significantly influence economic performance. The mediation analysis also showed that operational competitiveness, firm reputation and environmental performance play no mediation role between green manufacturing and economic performance. Furthermore, social performance is found to mediate the relationship between green manufacturing and economic performance. Research limitations/implications: The study did not consider any moderator variables. Also, the universal applicability and generalizability are somewhat a problem since data was mainly collected from Ghana, an emerging country. Practical implications: The results provide managers with reasonable evidence to proactively implement and invest in green manufacturing practices because such practices will not only have a positive impact on their sustainable performance dimensions but further enhance operational competitiveness and provide firms with superior reputation. Originality/value: The study provides significant findings that contribute to and expand the literature on green manufacturing, and it is among the relatively few studies that has investigated the link between green manufacturing, sustainable performance dimensions, firm reputation and operational competitiveness, especially from a mediation analysis perspective. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic performance; Environmental performance; Firm reputation; Green manufacturing practices; Operational competitiveness; Social performance","Competition; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Design/methodology/approach; Economic and environmental performance; Economic performance; Environmental performance; Manufacturing practices; Partial least square (PLS); Structural equation modelling; Sustainable performance; Green manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085954575

To realize the national abatement commitment, a rational allocation into its subunits (i.e. industries, provinces) is eagerly needed. Centralized allocation models can maximize the overall interests, but might cause implementation difficulty and fierce resistance from individual subunits. Based on this observation, this article will address the carbon emission abatement quota allocation problem from decentralized perspective, taking the competitive and cooperative relationships simultaneously into account. To this end, this article develops an integrated cooperative game data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. We first investigate the relative efficiency evaluation by taking flexible carbon emission abatement allocation plans into account, and then define a super-additive characteristic function for developing a cooperative game among units. To calculate the nucleolus-based allocation plan, a practical computation procedure is developed based on the constraint generation mechanism. Further, we present a two-layer way to allocate the CO2 abatement quota into different sub-industries and further different provinces in Chinese manufacturing industries. The empirical results show that five sub-industries (Processing of petroleum, coking and processing of nuclear fuel; Smelting and pressing of ferrous metals; Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products; Manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical product; Smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals) and two provinces (Guangdong and Shandong) will be allocated more than 10% of the total national carbon emission abatement quota. © 2019.

For example, a retailer's consumer data might be compromised via an attack on a supplier. In general, individual nodes in a supply chain bear the entire cost of their own cybersecurity investments, but some of the benefits of the investments may be enjoyed by the other nodes as well. We analyze the differences between coordinated and uncoordinated cybersecurity investments, as well as the differences resulting from a strategic and a non-strategic attacker. We find that lack of coordination leads to underinvestment with a non-strategic attacker, but that this is somewhat counterbalanced by an attacker being strategic. Lack of coordination may lead to either underinvestment or overinvestment with a strategic attacker, depending on how large the indirect damages from attacks are relative to the direct damages; overinvestment is more likely if indirect damages are relatively minor. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the impacts of and relationships between coordinated investments and a strategic attacker. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Attacker-defender model; Cybersecurity; Interdependent security; Supply chain coordination; Supply chain management","Supply chain management; Cyber security; Interdependent security; Over-investment; Supply chain coordination; Underinvestment; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072842932

The goal is to achieve a good prediction accuracy out of sample. We consider main effects and detailed interaction effects models using various machine learning methods. We find that Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) yields a predictive model achieving the best prediction accuracy for future return volume due to its ability to select informative interaction terms out of more than one thousand possible combinations.

The major driver characteristics, evacuation route characteristics, driving conditions, and traffic characteristics that affect the driving performance of individuals, including vulnerable population groups, are incorporated in the proposed mathematical model. In order to solve the developed mathematical model and analyze the trade-offs among the conflicting objectives, this study presents four multiobjective heuristic algorithms.

Its ‘dark’ side concerns the under-investment problem caused by non-appropriability of R&D benefits. On the ‘bright’ side, R&D spillovers are a source of productivity gains. Both aspects have been invoked to justify public support for R&D investment directly and indirectly. To establish whether public support can be justified due to productivity gains from spillovers, we meta-analyse 983 productivity estimates for spillovers and 501 estimates for own-R&D from 60 empirical studies. Our findings indicate that the average spillover effect is: (i) positive but heterogenous and smaller than what is reported in most narrative reviews; (ii) usually smaller than that of own-R&D capital; (iii) too small to be practically significant when evidence with adequate statistical power is considered. Controlling for observable sources of heterogeneity and best-practice research, the meta-effect is insignificant in the full sample but significant and large among OECD firms/industries/countries.

We analyze and compare two types of pollution regulation: Cap-and-Trade and Taxes. Firms can respond to regulation by any combination of pollution abatement, output reduction, emissions trading (under Cap-and- Trade), or payment of pollution taxes (under Taxes). We prove that well-chosen regulation can, besides reducing pollution, actually improve firms' profits relative to laissez-faire (unregulated markets), and simultaneously improve consumer surplus and welfare. Thus, regulation Pareto-dominates laissez-faire under a wide range of plausible conditions. These results are driven by an unintended consequence of pollution regulation: Competing firms can use the regulation to tacitly (and credibly) collude to reduce production and improve their profits. We show that the degree of competition plays a critical role in determining the economic consequences of pollution regulation. Our results suggest that the regulator's primary consideration should be the impact of regulation on consumers rather than producers. © 2020 INFORMS.","Cap-and-trade; Competition; Pollution regulation; Taxes","Emission control; Profitability; Competitive markets; Consumer surplus; Differentiated products; Economic consequences; Emissions Trading; Pollution abatement; Pollution regulation; Unintended consequences; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092931550

We utilize a model that captures three different environmental regulations: (1) emissions tax, (2) emissions permit-trading, and (3) command-and-control. Our results show that if the variable emissions tax, permit price or emissions penalty is nonzero, the firm should always invest in green technology emissions reductions. In general, we observe an all-or-nothing trend regarding end-of-pipe abatement investment. In particular, the firm invests in best available end-of-pipe abatement technology (BACT-EOP) when the variable emissions tax, permit price or emission penalty is greater than the per unit cost of end-of-pipe abatement. Moreover, we show that investments in end-of-pipe abatement can enhance investments in green technology, but that investments in end-of-pipe abatement should be pursued secondarily. Furthermore, we find that while the facility size, and consequently the local and global transportation emissions, are not impacted by an emissions tax regulation, facility size is impacted by an emissions permit trading or command-and-control emissions regulation. With regards to emissions, frequently there is a direct trade-off between local vs. global transportation and production emissions. To illustrate, we show that regulations that yield the lowest local production emissions, i.e. emissions from a single facility, do not always yield the lowest global production, and local and global transportation emissions. In fact, the conditions that yield the lowest local transportation emissions yield the largest global transportation emissions, and vice versa. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions abatement; Environmental regulations; Facility location; OR in environment and climate change","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Investments; Supply chains; Taxation; Abatement investment; Abatement technologies; Command and control; Emissions abatements; Emissions reduction; Emissions regulations; Facility locations; Single facilities; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076577186

Their market is projected to reach $95 billion by 2025, representing a large portion of the economy within the next decade. With these technologies gaining wide popularity, it is critical to understand their usage in the context of the various benefits and perils that they offer. Even though top-rated mobile applications face an increasing challenge to retain users, few studies have attempted to decipher the dilemma in their continuance momentum. In this study, we focus on Pokémon GO, a top-rated Augmented Reality app, using it as a special case to investigate factors influencing user continuance and more use intention. We extend expectation confirmation theory by incorporating the effects of subjective norm, perceived risk, technical features and sense of direction. To increase the relevance and richness of our understanding of risks and benefits, we integrate the text analytics and survey-based theory-validating research methodology to build and test our research model. Our findings suggest that rational risk/benefit calculus and satisfaction are two primary inputs for continuance intention. Besides physical health benefits, users also value the benefits in mental health and relationship building. The risks in performance, time and safety are salient risk dimensions that negatively impact satisfaction. Furthermore, we find technical features play a strong role in influencing perceived benefits and user satisfaction. The findings also provide important practical implications for the designers of next-generation mobile apps enabled by Augmented Reality. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Augmented reality; Multi-method approach; Post-adoption use intention; Technical features; Text analytics","Calculations; Surveys; Virtual reality; Continuance intentions; Expectation Confirmation Theory; Generation technologies; Multi-method approach; Research methodologies; Technical features; Text analytics; Use intentions; Augmented reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057432657

However, despite major efforts of manufacturers and governments to promote the technology, the adoption rate is still low. Among others, the absence of appropriate technology education is considered a major hurdle for adoption. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the behavioral intention of high school teachers to use these novel technologies in class. We propose applying the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology by integrating anxiety and attitude toward using technology. Data from 103 high school teachers is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The results show that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, anxiety, and attitude toward using technology significantly affect the adoption of novel technology. Contrary to expectations, effort expectancy and social influence do not affect the behavioral intention. Thus, the study adds to prior knowledge by underlining the need for further investigation of the relevance of anxiety and attitude toward using a novel technology in individual adoption processes. © 2018, The Author(s).","3D printing; Behavioral intention; Novel technology; Technology acceptance; Technology adoption; UTAUT","Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Teaching; 3-D printing; Behavioral intention; Technology acceptance; Technology adoption; UTAUT; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053602144

The existing academic literature has predominantly studied factors that drive crowd investments and whether crowdfunding predicts market success. However, we argue that the involvement of customers goes beyond the provision of capital. As investors, customers enter into a principal–agent relationship with entrepreneurs. Thus, entrepreneurs are often faced with a crowd of customer investors who try to influence product development. We show that entrepreneurs can benefit from this influence, because customer investors provide some of the support usually received from institutional investors. Greater involvement from customer investors thus increases funding success. This holds when we control for creator ability and project quality. The effect is driven by customers’ influence on product development and the reduction in agency costs for prospective customers. We also link the involvement of customer investors during crowdfunding to the crowdsourcing literature and show that its positive effect is augmented by the elicitation of external information through distant search. © 2019 The Author(s)","Crowdfunding; Crowdsourcing; Entrepreneurship; New product development; Principal–agent relationship","Crowdsourcing; Product development; Sales; Academic literature; Crowdfunding; Entrepreneurship; External informations; Innovation projects; Institutional investors; New product development; Prospective customers; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074733376

Delivering products to customers in a timely and reliable manner enhances customer experience and companies' profitability. In this research, we explore the extent to which customers value a high-quality delivery experience when shopping online. Our identification strategy exploits a natural experiment: A clash between SF Express and Alibaba, the largest private logistics service provider with the highest reputation in delivery quality in China and the largest online retail platform in China, respectively. The clash resulted in Alibaba unexpectedly removing SF Express as a shipping option from Alibaba's retail platform for 42 hours in June 2017. Using a difference-in-differences design, we analyze the market performance of 129,448 representative stock-keeping units on Alibaba to quantify the economic value of a highquality delivery service to sales, product variety, and logistics rating. We find that the removal of the high-quality delivery option from Alibaba's retail platform reduced sales by 14.56% during the clash, increased the contribution of long-tail to total sales-sales dispersion-by 3%, but did not impact the variety and logistics rating of sold products. Furthermore, we also identify product characteristics that attenuate the value of highquality logistics and find that the removal of SF Express is more obstructive for (1) star products as compared with long-tail products because the same star products are likely to be supplied by competing retail platforms that customers can easily switch to, (2) expensive products because customers need a reliable delivery service to protect their valuable items from damage or loss, and (3) less-discounted products because customers are more willing to sacrifice the service quality over a price markdown. © 2019 INFORMS.","Delivery; Natural experiment; Retail platform; Sales dispersion; Service quality","Product design; Stars; Customer experience; Difference-in-differences; Expensive products; Identification strategies; Logistics service provider; Natural experiment; Product characteristics; Stock keeping unit; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094864396

We propose that the financial impact of such configurations is contingent on the country's institutional setting. In Liberal Market Economies (LMEs), where firms face strong pressures to achieve short-term goals, the combination of MEPs and CSR creates shareholder value, particularly when firms engage in internally oriented CSR projects. Conversely, in Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs), where institutions already curb short-term demands, the combined adoption of MEPs and CSR initiatives destroys shareholder value, particularly when this CSR is external. Overall, our study enhances understanding of the institutional complementarity between corporate governance and CSR. Managerial summary: This study examines how two organizational practices, managerial entrenchment provisions (MEPs), and corporate social responsibility (CSR), combine between them to improve or reduce firms’ financial success. Our analysis demonstrates that institutional framework has a strong influence on their combined effect. When the institutional context supports solutions to coordination problems among economic agents through market-based arrangements, MEPs allow the implementation of strategies directed to promote long-term investments and relationships. In this case, MEPs when paired with CSR allow generating intangibles that contribute to create shareholder value. Contrarily, in frameworks with coordination mechanisms based on nonmarket arrangements, the joint adoption of MEPs and CSR destroys value by increasing the power of managers and blockholders to extract rents at the expense of firms’ minority shareholders. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","comparative capitalism; corporate governance; corporate social responsibility; managerial entrenchment; shareholder value","Commerce; Investments; Managers; comparative capitalism; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); managerial entrenchment; Shareholder values; Shareholders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078918905

Based on a global multi-regional input-output model and the water stress index, this study assesses the water scarcity impacts and economic benefits of the Initiative on countries along the Belt and Road route. The results indicate that considering water scarcity reveals new insights into the virtual water trade of the Belt and Road Initiative. There are great differences between the top virtual water exporters (mainly in Southern and Southeastern Asia) and the top virtual scarce water exporters (mainly in Southern and Central Asia) to China. In addition, water scarcity changes the trade balance between China and certain countries. For example, Russia, Indonesia, New Zealand, Madagascar, and Serbia are net virtual water exporters, but net virtual scarce water importers. In the net virtual scarce water trade with China, Pakistan, India, and Turkmenistan are the top net exporters, while South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia are the top net importers. Considering both the impacts of water scarcity and economic benefits, there is a significant difference in virtual scarce water use among countries to gain equal economic benefits from China. This study can facilitate policy decisions with regard to the Belt and Road Initiative for trade structure optimization and water scarcity mitigation when maximizing economic benefits from the global perspective. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Belt and Road Initiative; Global value chain; Input-output analysis; Scarcity; Virtual water","Commerce; Economic analysis; Roads and streets; Structural optimization; Water resources; Global perspective; Global value chain; Input output analysis; Scarcity; Structure optimization; Virtual water; Virtual water trade; Water stress indices; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077498463

However, despite numerous studies discussing the benefits of advanced technologies in the workplace, there is a lack of research on smart offices and how they affect productivity and employee well-being. This opinion paper argues that office spaces constitute a distinctive type of space, and research on smart homes or manufacturing does not suffice to capture its essence.

Innovation is considered by researchers and scholars to be a key driver for achieving sustainability. One of the key parts in any sustainable supply chains is sustainable supplier evaluation and selection. However, few sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) studies have focused on sustainable supplier evaluation and selection, particularly in the context of sustainable innovation management. Thus, supplier evaluation and selection studies that consider overall sustainability (social, environmental, and economic) innovation criteria are nearly non-existent. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a decision framework to assess sustainable innovative suppliers. A combination of best worst method (BWM) and modified Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) is employed as an integrated model in the analysis. The BWM is initially applied to identify the sustainable innovation criteria weights, and then the modified PROMETHEE is used to analyze the suppliers’ performance. A manufacturing case example is employed to verify the utility and applicability of the proposed methodology. This paper can assist industrial managers, researchers, and decision-makers in understanding and focusing on sustainable innovation, particularly when selecting suppliers, and enhancing their supply chains’ sustainability to make progress toward sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BWM; PROMETHEE; Supplier selection; Sustainable innovation; Sustainable supply chain management","Decision making; Supply chain management; Competitive business; Decision framework; Industrial managers; Innovation management; Integrated modeling; Preference ranking; Supplier evaluation and selections; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089686523

Scant research exists on the three pillars of sustainability ― economy, environment, and society ― in production frameworks through the lens of process improvement tools such as lean and six-sigma. Based on lean six-sigma, this paper develops a sustainable lean production framework (SLPF) for manufacturing companies supported by the theory of practice-based view. Since a high portion of production frameworks failed to reach the sustainability goals in the implementation, we use practitioners’ and scholars’ perspectives to build a framework including five stages and fifteen steps. To validate the framework, we empirically apply practitioners’ opinions using the Delphi method. Moreover, we experimentally verify the framework by implementing it in a cookware manufacturing company. The result showed that the proposed framework can significantly improve sustainability pillars, e.g., after an investment of $10,212, our case implementation was improved in the economy by $120,142 saving per year, the environment by reducing 257.14 tonnes CO2 per year and the society by minimizing 48 safety incidents per year, and 24 worker-absence per year. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Framework implementation; Practice-based view theory; Six-sigma; Sustainable lean production framework (SLPF)","Climate change; Competition; Investments; Lean production; Manufacture; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Six sigma; Work simplification; Competitive advantage; Global climate changes; Lean and Six Sigma; Manufacturing companies; Process Improvement; Production process; Safety incidents; Theory of practices; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089139334

Business performances include market share performance and innovation performance. The analysis results show that (1) supply chain information sharing has significant positive impact on quality management practices and supplier specific investment; and (2) quality management practices and supplier specific investment have significant positive impact on both market share performance and innovation performance. This study also finds that not only the market share performance and innovation performance but also the level of quality management practice and supplier's specific investment are higher at the coastal Zhejiang province than seven inland provinces. Regarding the supplier specific investment, firms facing severe intense competition tend not to invest as much as those facing fair level of competition. For the firms with different levels of supplier specific investment (i.e. low, and high), this study finds no difference in quality management practice, supply chain information sharing, and business performances. Finally, innovation performance is found to be positively correlated with market share performance.

These changes have yielded a variety of new economic and academic niches, including journals with questionable peer-review systems and business models, commonly dubbed “predatory publishing.” Empirical analysis of Cabellʼs Journal Blacklist reveals substantial diversity in types and degrees of predatory publishing. While some blacklisted publishers produce journals with many severe violations of academic norms, “gray” journals and publishers occupy borderline or ambiguous niches between predation and legitimacy. Predation in academic publishing is not a simple binary phenomenon and should instead be perceived as a spectrum with varying types and degrees of illegitimacy. Conceptions of predation are based on overlapping evaluations of academic and economic legitimacy. High institutional status benefits publishers by reducing conflicts between—if not aligning—professional and market institutional logics, which are more likely to conflict and create illegitimacy concerns in downmarket niches. High rejection rates imbue high-status journals with value and pricing power, while low-status OA journals face “predatory” incentives to optimize revenue via low selectivity. Status influences the social acceptability of profit-seeking in academic publishing, rendering lower-status publishers vulnerable to being perceived and stigmatized as illegitimate. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology",,"Academic publishing; Business models; Empirical analysis; Institutional logic; Peer review system; Rejection rates; Social acceptability; Economics; article; conception; human; illegitimacy; open access publishing; peer review; predation; profit; social acceptance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080126044

Recent research suggests that CEOs' characteristics can influence their general decisions to engage with stakeholders, however, this work has yet to consider why CEOs might utilize specific stakeholder strategies. In this article, we demonstrate how CEO regulatory focus influences the nature of a firm's stakeholder strategy. Specifically, we argue that CEO prevention focus is positively associated with engagement in governance-oriented initiatives and receptivity to governance-oriented stakeholder activism, while CEO promotion focus is positively associated with engagement in socially-oriented initiatives and receptivity to socially-oriented stakeholder activism. We find strong support for our hypotheses in a sample of 374 publicly-traded firms. Managerial summary: The strategies a firm uses to engage with stakeholders can influence its performance, yet little is known about what makes firms focus on certain stakeholders over others. To better understand this, we examined CEO regulatory focus in a sample of large public companies. Our findings reveal that the way CEOs view decisions—either based on a sense of duty, obligations, and responsibility or as a means to achieve high ideals—influences their tendency to prioritize shareholder concerns or the concerns of a broader array of stakeholders. This suggests that executives should be aware of their own natural tendencies to inject their motivations into their firm's stakeholder strategy and consider avenues to balance their perspectives for the sake of the firm. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CEO decision-making; corporate social responsibility; regulatory focus theory; stakeholder strategy; upper echelons theory","Decision making; Decision theory; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Public company; Recent researches; Regulatory focus; stakeholder strategy; Strategy research; Upper echelons theories; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079174109

SR covers a broad spectrum of issues which includes working conditions, preventing corruption, human rights etc. That must be considered in a business context. Developing countries are becoming more aware but to cover the comprehensive spectrum of SR will take time, especially the adoption of SR practices into supply chains. Nowadays, ready-made garments companies of developing countries have to consider SR practices due to pressure from governments and stakeholders. Many of these companies are responsible for a large contribution to the economic growth of the country and thus, need a SR based sustainable business environment to gain a competitive advantage. Due to the lack of practices in SR based sourcing into an existing supply chain (SC), this sector demands an evaluation of the drivers to SR practices. Therefore, the unique contribution of this research is to evaluate sustainable drivers for implementation of SR based sourcing of ready-made garments SC in the context of a developing country - Bangladesh. To achieve the objectives, Delphi based fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods are employed. An analysis shows that finance is the key driver, composed of four important sub-sets; these are sustainable economic benefits, maximization of the net return on investment, business ethics and an enhanced reputation in the global market.

We also show that gold futures are partially a safe haven for equity investments in the short-term, but not in the mid-term. Finally, we uncover some hedging (financialization) of crude oil futures associated to global demand (oil supply) shocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Commodity futures returns; Equity returns; Financialization; Hedging","Commerce; Gold; Investments; Commodity futures; Crude oil futures; Equity investment; Equity markets; Equity returns; Financialization; Global demand; Hedging; Financial markets; commodity market; correlation; crude oil; demand analysis; energy efficiency; finance; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077796325

Using a mixed methodology approach, focus group discussions with financier stakeholders in the UK's PFI/PPP industry were used to identify 23 criteria relevant for evaluating completion risk in funding applications. These criteria were put in a questionnaire survey to wider audiences of financiers of PFI/PPP projects in the UK. A series of statistical tests were performed, including reliability analysis, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test, descriptive statistics, principal rank agreement factor (PRAF), and regression analysis. After identifying 21 reliable criteria influencing the bankability of completion risk, the general agreement of three major financier stakeholders (senior lenders, equity financiers, and infrastructure financiers) on all criteria were examined through the Kruskal-Wallis test and PRAF. A regression model, constructed and validated with input from another team of expert financiers, revealed five key criteria influencing the bankability of completion risk in PPP megaprojects. These include (1) a construction contractor with years of experience of successful completion of megaprojects, (2) the construction contractor's financial strength, (3) the existence of tried-and-tested technology for the construction of project, (4) the availability of an independent technical consultant (ITC), and (5) the existence of a fixed-price turnkey (FPTK) construction contract.

In order to achieve sustainability, operational excellence initiatives are practiced by different organizations. The intent is to investigate how to perform the practices of operational excellence towards sustainability in industries. In the existing literature, some studies investigated key performance indicators (KPIs) for other domains that are not readily applicable in the background of an emerging economy, principally for the leather products industry. To fulfill these research gaps, this study contributes to the operational excellence literature by recognizing the KPIs of operational excellence towards sustainability by examining the peer-reviewed scientific articles and through expert's suggestions. The identified KPIs are segregated into six dominant categories and 27 sub-KPIs in the field of leather products industry. Further, the prioritization of the KPIs is established by adopting the best-worst method (BWM), which involves simple pairwise comparison matrices compared with other multicriteria decision making techniques. The findings indicate that the KPIs under the “Management” category are at the highest priority. It is anticipated that the results originated from the study will support the expert's to appropriately recognize the significant KPIs and drop insignificant KPIs for successful operational excellence towards sustainability practices in the supply chain of the emerging economy. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","business strategy; key performance indicators; leather products industry; operational excellence; sustainability","business; manufacturing; productivity; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087625300

However, when lean and agile production have been explored simultaneously, the quality and flexibility trade-offs have been mixed and unclear. In order to dispel the lean-agile ambiguity, and given that both high levels of flexibility and quality are required within the automotive industry, the purpose of this study was to: (a) Identify the relationship between flexibility and quality; and (b) Explore the quality and flexibility differences between lean and agile production. Primary quantitative data was obtained via a survey and a total of 140 automotive manufacturing firms within the UK returned the survey. Logistic regressions were utilised as the main mode of analysis. Not only was an inverse relationship found between quality and flexibility, but our findings depict two distinctive Business Models (BMs) existing in the automotive industry, one lean and one agile. We advance the lean-agile debate by asserting that lean and agile firms acquire quality (efficiency) and flexibility strengths respectively, and not vice-versa. Given this, we theoretically side with the notion of performance ‘trade-offs’ and contend the idea that capabilities are cumulatively gained. By incorporating an argument built on the strategy literature on BMs and Dynamic Capabilities, we assert that lean and agile firms have evolved to underpin different kinds of competitive advantage within the same industry, but these advantages are placed at different tiers in the automotive supply chain. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agile; automotive; Flexibility; lean; performance; quality","Commerce; Competition; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Image quality; Lean production; Manufacture; Supply chains; Surveys; agile; automotive; Flexibility; lean; performance; Automotive industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074532336

In this study, we constructed index system of forest ecological security and forestry management efficiency, based on 30 provinces. With the help of Super-CCR model, coupling coordination model and spatial panel models, the coupling coordination degree of forest ecological security and forestry management efficiency, and its spatiotemporal pattern characteristics and influencing factors of each province in China from 2003 to 2017 were measured and analyzed. Results showed that, first, in terms of forestry management efficiency, the number of DEA-efficiency provinces increased between 2003 and 2017, yet was still below 50% of all provinces. Efficiency values of most provinces in the Southern Forest Region increased significantly, whereas those of the Northern Forest Region decreased. In terms of forest ecological security, the index increased overall, with most high-value areas in the Northeast, Southwest, and Southern Forest Regions. Second, coupling coordination degree varied from near no coordination to intermediate coordination. Except for a decline in the Northern Region, the degree of coupling coordination in the other regions demonstrated an upward trend, with the growth from high to low in the Southern, Southwest and Northeast Forest Region. Spatially, high values appeared mainly in the Southern and Southwest Forest Regions, while low values mainly concentrated in the Northern Forest Region. Third, coupling coordination was affected by many factors, including nature, population, economy, society, and technological progress, driving temporal patterns and regional differences.

The forecasting literature, often disjoint from the needs of the forecast users, has focused on providing optimal models in terms of likelihood and various accuracy metrics. However, there is evidence that this does not always lead to better inventory performance, as often the translation between forecast errors and inventory results is not linear. In this study, we consider an approach to parametrising forecasting models by directly considering appropriate inventory metrics and the current inventory policy. We propose a way to combine the competing multiple inventory objectives, i.e. meeting demand, while eliminating excessive stock, and use the resulting cost function to identify inventory optimal parameters for forecasting models. We evaluate the proposed parametrisation against established alternatives and demonstrate its performance on real data. Furthermore, we explore the connection between forecast accuracy and inventory performance and discuss the extent to which the former is an appropriate proxy of the latter. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; Inventory management; Likelihood; Optimisation; Simulation","Cost functions; Inventory control; Forecasting models; Inventory management; Inventory performance; Inventory planning; Inventory policies; Likelihood; Optimisations; Simulation; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077690632

This study aims to find the prominent variables and their conditional dependencies/interrelations that affect student attrition in college settings. Specifically, using a large and feature-rich dataset, proposed methodology successfully captures the probabilistic interactions between attrition (the dependent variable) and related factors (the independent variables) to reveal the underlying, potentially complex/non-linear relationships. The proposed methodology successfully predicts the individual students' attrition risk through a Bayesian Belief Network-driven probabilistic model. The findings suggest that the proposed probabilistic graphical/network method is capable of predicting student attrition with 84% in AUC – Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve.

Most bioeconomic models assume single-species fisheries with perfectly elastic demand and focus on inter-seasonal dynamics. In real-world fisheries, vessels hold quotas for multiple species with heterogeneous biological and/or market conditions that vary intra-seasonally. We analyze within-season behavior in multispecies fisheries with individual fishing quotas, accounting for stock aggregations, capacity constraints, and downward-sloping demand. Numerical results demonstrate variation in harvest patterns. We specifically find: (1) harvests for species with downward-sloping demand tend to spread out; (2) spreading harvest of a high-value species can cause lower-value species to be harvested earlier in the season; and (3) harvest can be unresponsive or even respond negatively to biological aggregation when fishers balance incentives in multispecies settings. We test these using panel data from the Norwegian multispecies groundfish fishery and find evidence for all three. We extend the numerical model to account for transitions to management with individual fishing quotas in multispecies fisheries. We show that, under some circumstances, fishing seasons could contract or spread out. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Catch shares; Fishing behavior; Multi-fishery; Multispecies fishery; Seafood demand; Seasonal harvest; Sequential fishery","Harvesting; Bio-economic model; Biological aggregations; Capacity constraints; Catch shares; Multi-species; Numerical results; Seafood demand; Seasonal dynamics; Fisheries; catch statistics; fishing; market conditions; multispecies fishery; numerical model; panel data; seafood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078782191

The power law process is used to model product failures and evaluate warranty costs. The multinomial logit model is adopted to describe customer choice behaviors. From a warrantor's perspective, the design and pricing problem is to determine which candidate options to offer and the associated prices so as to maximize the expected warranty profit. We show that the optimal strategy is to offer all candidate options associated with a cost-plus-margin pricing policy, with the same profit margins for all options. If only a limited number of options can be offered, then the options with the highest valuation margins should be selected. In addition, we present three extended models by incorporating heterogeneous warranty breadths, free preventive maintenance programs, and customers with heterogeneous perceptions of product failure probability. Major findings in the extended models include: (i) a free preventive maintenance program should be attached to a warranty option only when it is feasible for that option; and (ii) when the customer population is heterogeneous, the equal-margin pricing policy is no longer optimal. Overall, this work will equip practitioners with a quantitative tool to design and price extended warranty menus in various practical scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Extended warranty; Multinomial logit model; Pricing; Warranty menu","Cost benefit analysis; Profitability; Railroad transportation; Sales; Extended warranties; Multinomial Logit; Multinomial logit model; Optimal strategies; Power law process; Pricing problems; Product failures; Quantitative tool; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085760046

In this research, a framed field experiment with a case study within the Egyptian medical sector was employed, since the waste generated by this sector is not only large but also toxic. In total, 209 accounting and auditing staff employed in central hospitals in Egypt were interviewed. The study shows that integrating life cycle costing and life-cycle assessment through the value chain reduces costs, improves environmental performance and improves economic and environmental efficiency to make strategic decisions. This demonstrates that integration supports decision making to achieve sustainable development. Also, the study provides a framework for the integration of life cycle costing and life cycle assessment based on the value chain. Our evidence related to the important role played by the integration of life cycle costing and life cycle assessment in the configuration of economic and environmental performance can be useful for informing future policy and regulatory initiatives, especially in developing countries such as Egypt.

The crucial step of scenario planning is the effective identification of the uncertain and most influential drivers and key factors. This paper integrates the Delphi survey into scenario planning. It proposes a four-step analytical procedure of Delphi survey-based scenario planning: identifying the key ingredients from Delphi results, establishing the causal relationships among key ingredients, scenario development, and scenario description. The integrated method has been adopted in the planning practice for the renewable energy development strategy towards 2030 in China. Based on the three uncertain and most influential drivers, “technology development,” “ecological awareness,” and “national energy pricing,” most possibly influencing the renewable energy development towards 2030 in China, a novel three-dimensional scenario analytical framework composed of eight future scenarios is constructed. Considering the possibility in China's practice, five scenarios are selected as possible development scenarios of China's renewable energy towards 2030.

This paper aims at making the class assignment process in AHPSort more flexible by using fuzzy sets theory, which facilitates soft transitions between classes and provides additional information about the membership of alternatives in each class that can be used to fine-tune actions beyond the crisp sorting process. This essentially complements the ordinal information of its crisp variant with cardinal information as to the degree of membership of an alternative to each class.

First exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were applied for the establishment of measurement model and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to find the significant influence barriers on Internet banking adoption. In the second phase, the neural network model was used to rank the relative influence of significant predictors obtained from SEM. The results indicate a significant positive relationship between value barrier, risk barrier, and image barrier with the usage of Internet banking. Only, the traditional barrier has a negative insignificant effect on the usage of Internet banking. The image barrier has a higher impact on usage of Internet banking followed by the value barrier and risk barrier. Results also indicate that males are facing high barriers in comparison with females.

Taking down jackets and trousers sold on Tmall—China's largest B2C e-commerce platform—as the example, this paper collects data about three factors that influence consumers' first impression on their search results: the price of a product, the quantity of historical reviews, and a photo of the product. Among these factors, previous research shows that a product photo contains four attributes: brand logo, promotional information, street scenes, and model display. Focusing on these attributes, we apply a decision tree to explore customer purchasing patterns, which allows us to further investigate the influence of product photo attributes on sales volume by using a hierarchical regression model. Our research finds that among the products from the list of their search results, customers prefer those with many good historical reviews and low prices. In addition, gender that differentiates men's from women's clothing has a moderating effect on the relationship between photo attributes and product sales. The purchase decision of consumers shopping for men's clothing is susceptible to the influence of the product photo. Furthermore, different from the traditional view which shows that brands can reduce perceived risks and increase sales, this study finds that men's clothing sales are negatively affected by brand logo attribute in product photos. Finally, using models cannot significantly increase product sales among consumers shopping for either men's or women's clothing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer reviews; E-commerce; First Sight; Online sales; Product photos","Decision trees; Electronic commerce; Regression analysis; Sales; Consumer reviews; First impressions; First Sight; Hierarchical regression models; Historical review; Moderating effect; Online sales; Product photos; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077931293

This is problematic, since it can impede operational effectiveness, prevent inter-organisational knowledge-creation and hamper organisational learning. This paper addresses this issue by adopting a cross-discipline approach and presenting meta-rules as a solution to aid organisational decision making. It is proposed that meta-rules can help resolve tensions arising from conflicting priorities between academics, knowledge transfer offices and industry and help facilitate strategic alignment of processes and policies within and between organisations. This research contributes to the growing debate on the strategic challenges of managing knowledge transfer and presents meta-rules as a practical solution to facilitate strategic alignment of internal and external stakeholder tensions. Meta-rules has previously only been applied in a computer intelligence context however, this research proves the efficacy of meta rules in a university–industry knowledge transfer context.

First, substantial fossil fuel reserves will be stranded at the end of the fossil era. Second, this is true for exploration capital too. Third, unanticipated changes in present or expected climate policy cause discrete jumps in today's valuation of physical and natural capital. Fourth, if timing and intensity of climate policy are uncertain, revaluation of assets occurs as uncertainty about future climate policy is resolved. To highlight these four effects, we use an analytical model of investment in exploration capital with intertemporal adjustment costs, reserves depletion and market capitalization, and calibrate it to the global oil and gas industry. Climate policy implements a carbon budget commensurate with 2 °C peak warming and we allow for immediate or delayed carbon taxes and renewable subsidies. The social welfare ranking of these instruments is inverse to that of the oil and gas industry which prefers renewable subsidy and delaying taxes for as long as possible. We also pay attention to how the legislative “risk” of tipping into policy action affects the timing of the end of the fossil era, the profitability of existing capital, and green paradox effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Adjustment costs; Botched climate policies; Discoveries; Exploration investment; Fossil fuel; Irreversible capital; Policy tipping; Stock prices; Stranded carbon assets","Budget control; Carbon; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Global warming; Investments; Proven reserves; Adjustment costs; Climate policy; Discoveries; Irreversible capital; Stock price; Stranded carbon assets; Costs; capital flow; carbon budget; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; global warming; policy implementation; pollution tax; profitability; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072405346

Thicker markets can offer more opportunities for participants to meet and higher chances that a potential match exists. However, they can also be vulnerable to potential search frictions. In this paper, using data from an online peer-to-peer holiday property rental platform, we aim to identify and measure the causal impact of market thickness on matching rates. In particular, we exploit an exogenous shock to market size caused by a one-time migration of listings from other platforms, which gives rise to a quasiexperimental design. We find that increased market thickness actually leads to lower matching rates. Keeping search technology and other factors constant, doubling market size leads to a 15.4% reduction in traveler confirmation rate and a 15.9% reduction in host occupancy rate. As a result, the platform lost 5.6% of potential matches because of the increased market size.

This effect is especially prominent when the matching needs to take place within a limited time. Our results offer insights for future empirical and theoretical research on matching markets.

Business models currently in use do not deliver sustainable and durable DRT in urban areas. This can be minimised using transport modelling tools ahead of the operation phase. However, transport models are not fit for purpose when it comes to model on-demand shared mobility services and the integration of these services in a complex public transport ecosystem. This paper focuses on how to model demand for ride-shared mobility services and how to plan for these services when running in integration with mass transit. An Agent Based Model (ABM), built in the open-source Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MatSim) platform for Bristol (UK), has used an activity-based approach to model demand for two New Mobility Services (NMS). This was then generated using anonymised and aggregated Mobile phone Network Dataset (MND), both as a trip-based and trip chains dataset to assess the capabilities of MND. Results show that the simulations built using the trip chains MND datasets (722,752 agents generated) lead to better insights in users’ travel patterns. An advanced method using additional data sources covering land-use (location of business, services and transport facilities) was used to infer purpose and mode of transport during the multimodal journeys. The output of the ABM predicts demand for two flexible on-demand services, identifying best routes to maximise the number of users served and quantifying the benefits in the integration with public transport services and in modal shift from private cars. This is expected to be useful either for Local Authorities for transport planning purposes, and for operators looking at financially sustainable DRT. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent based modelling; Demand responsive transport; MaaS; MatSim; Mobile phone network data; Shared mobility","Autonomous agents; Cellular telephones; Computational methods; Door to door service (freight); Integration; Land use; Motor transportation; Multi agent systems; Simulation platform; Urban planning; Agent-based modelling; Demand responsive transport; MaaS; MatSim; Mobile phone networks; Transportation routes; activity pattern; computer simulation; data set; integrated approach; mobile phone; numerical model; public transport; transportation planning; travel behavior; travel demand; Bristol [Bristol (ADS)]; Bristol [England]; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073012848

We observed links of maintenance function with product competitiveness and with energy management activities that were unexpected. We confirmed benefits from keeping machinery in good working conditions and restoring promptly good working conditions when an issue happens. The depth of maintenance contribution on each area identified in this study will depend on the operational and business context of the manufacturing company; thus, companies need to reflect on these based on their specific processes, business needs and goals.

This work investigates the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis considering a set of twelve of the fourteen OPEC countries. It contributes to previous literature exploring the Environmental Kuznets Curve relationship by analysing how economic activity sector diversification impacts the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions, addressing an important identified gap. To address this gap, annual data from 1992 to 2015 is used. A panel cross-section analysis is provided between countries, and for the seven considered sectors, is estimated through panel corrected standard errors and convergence estimations are presented. Conclusions point to the relocation of pollution-intensive sectors to almost all of the OPEC countries. For all countries, a U-shaped relationship is evidenced, implying that economic growth in oil-producing and exporting countries increases environmental degradation. While energy consumption increases environmental damage, trade openness seems to have a significant and negative effect over emissions, leading to environmental improvements. This study points out that OPEC countries will have increased challenges facing them in terms of environmental degradation and only a few economic activity sectors can conduct environmental improvements through growth. The inclusion of oil prices increased coefficients magnitude. Probably these sectors are already allocating more labour and capital in projects and investments on renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy savings, substituting fossil fuels like oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Convergence; Economic activity sectors; EKC hypothesis; Organization of the petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) countries; Panel corrected standard errors (PCSE)","Crude oil price; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Investments; Cross-section analysis; Economic activities; Energy efficiency and energy savings; Environmental damage; Environmental improvements; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental Kuznets curves; Renewable energies; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089227414

Regardless, ownership is decoupled from individual preferences in the long run, as the rental rates and the purchase prices of goods become equal. If there are costs of bringing unused capacity to the market, they are partially passed through, creating a bias toward ownership.

One explanation for this oversight is that limited information flow and cognitive bias limit their ability to recognize and develop CE opportunities. We propose a framework for a CE-focused incubator that removes these barriers to circular economy entrepreneurship. The framework defines how multiple stakeholders interact in order to provide critical information for CE development. Stakeholders include firms seeking economical ways to handle waste, firms that might use waste as value-added input, government agencies, and circular economy analysts that can provide potentially beneficial information, e.g. via Material Flow Analysis. Entrepreneurs would be recruited to develop CE ventures. The government would be asked to support initial financing, but the final start-ups would stand on their own as enterprises worthy of venture capital funding. The collaborative environment would promote profitable CE behavior. CE entrepreneurs need access to relevant information and a supportive network, both of which the CE-focused incubator we propose provides. Future work is needed to implement CE-incubators to engage entrepreneurs to realize economic and environmental benefits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CE incubator; Circular economy; Circular economy incubator; Entrepreneurship; Incubator; Material flows analysis","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Business incubators; Collaborative environments; Economic and environmental benefits; Economic opportunities; Limited information; Material flow analysis; Multiple stakeholders; Venture capital funding; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084641529

With the advancements in big data analytics, firms are increasingly investing in developing analytics capabilities to deliver operational improvements. However, the spillover effects of such technological solutions towards addressing stakeholder concerns and delivering on social performance are unclear. Drawing on stakeholder theory and RBV, this study investigates the role of supply chain analytics capability (SCAC) and customer pressure for ethical conduct (CPEC) towards the adoption of socially responsible practices by suppliers. The proposed relationships linking these constructs are empirically tested using data from a sample of 254 U.S. manufacturing firms. Findings indicate that supply chain analytics capability synergistically interacts with the pressure from customers for ethical conduct to improve the social and financial performance of suppliers. Findings also provide important implications for supply chain executives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Code of conduct; Responsible supply chains; Stakeholder theory; Supply chain analytics capability; Supply chain transparency","Data Analytics; Philosophical aspects; Sales; Sustainable development; Code of conduct; Exploratory studies; Financial performance; Global business environments; Operational improvements; Stakeholder theory; Supply chain executives; Technological solution; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076557637

Industry experts know that SMA creates new opportunities for organisations who want to more strongly engage with their customers and improve business performance. However, the relationship between social media analytic practices (SMAP), customer engagement (CE), and business performance (BP) has not yet been sufficiently investigated from an empirical perspective. In order to gain a better understanding of the relationship between SMAP and BP and the mediation role of CE in that process, a large-scale survey was conducted among senior and mid-level managers as well as consultants in the Retail and information technology (IT) industries in India. Specifically, a structured closed-ended questionnaire was administered to managers and management consultants country-wide and gathered usable responses from 281 respondents holding positions such as: Digital Marketing Executive/Digital Marketing Specialist, Management Consultant, Analytics Manager, Customer Relationship Manager, Marketing Director, Engagement Manager, etc. who were in charge of digital marketing strategies in the respondent retail and IT organisations. The questionnaire addressed issues related to the way in which SMAP contribute to an enhanced business performance through the mediation role of customer engagement.

However, such strategies might elicit annoyance in consumers as indicated by anecdotal evidence, such as the popularity of ad-blocking technologies. Our study captures this trade-off between effective and annoying display advertising. We propose a hidden Markov model that allows us to investigate both the enduring impact of display advertising on consumers’ purchase decisions and the potential of persistent display advertising to stimulate annoyance in consumers. Additionally, we study the structural dynamics of these advertising effects by allowing them to be contingent on the latent state of the funnel path in which each consumer resides. Our findings demonstrate that a tension exists between generating interest and triggering annoyance in consumers; whereas display advertising has an enduring impact on transitioning consumers further down the purchase funnel, persistent display advertising exposures beyond a frequency threshold can have an adverse effect by increasing the chances that consumers will be annoyed. Investigating the dynamics of these annoyance effects, we reveal that consumers who reside in different stages of the purchase funnel exhibit considerably different tolerance for annoyance stimulation. Our findings also reveal that the format of display advertisements and the level of diversification of ad creatives as well as consumer demographics moderate consumers’ thresholds for annoyance elicitation. For instance, advertisers can reduce annoyance elicitation as a result of frequent display advertising exposures when they use static rather than animated display ads as well as when they diversify the display ad creatives shown to consumers. Our paper contributes to the literature on digital advertising and consumer annoyance and has significant managerial implications for the online advertising ecosystem.

All the adopted approaches are based on a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to evaluate the relationship between perceived service quality and customer satisfaction. First a synthesis of the literature on model transferability is presented to compare these approaches in terms of model characteristics (structural equivalence) and parameter values (measurement equivalence). Three classes of model characteristics, including six distinct SEM structures in total, are tested to identify the factors affecting service quality: (1) recommendations of previously published models from the literature, (2) established customer satisfaction theories, and (3) adopting an exploratory approach and developing it based on the previous two approaches and the nature of locally collected data. Tehran Metro Line 3, which is a heavy urban rail mode, is used as a case study. The dataset consists of three hundred validated responses collected through a customer satisfaction survey. The results indicate that model characteristics are not transferable to this case study (i.e., none of the SEM structures from previous studies were directly transferable). The best model is developed when the entire modeling procedure is repeated using a wide range of affecting factors and gradually narrowing them down through model development. The final model comprises four latent variables, namely major services, comfort, security, and minor services, the first two of which have the largest effect on service quality. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Customer satisfaction; Perception; Public transport; Service quality; Structural equation model; Tehran Metro","Behavioral research; Model structures; Quality control; Quality of service; Sales; Sensory perception; Telecommunication services; Customer satisfaction survey; Perceived service qualities; Public transport; Service Quality; Service quality evaluation; Structural equation modeling; Structural equation models; Tehran metros; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078850989

Considering two dimensions of CEP, namely environmental management performance (EMP) and environmental operational performance (EOP), we find that EMP serves as an effective mechanism in reducing firm risk, and such an effect is mainly driven by the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, there is no clear association between EOP and firm risk. However, our findings highlight a moderating effect of EOP on the relationship between negative EMP and firm risk. This provides new insights into the value of multidimensional CEP and suggests that the complex relationship between outcome- and process-based environmental performance is important for understanding the real effects of CEP on firm risk.

The social media channels are interactive, inclusive, low-cost, and unconstrained by time or place. This two-way communication between governments and citizens is referred to as electronic citizen participation, or e-participation. E-participation in the age of technology is considered as a mean for citizens to express their opinions and as a new input to be integrated by policy makers to take decisions. Governments and policy makers always aim to increase such participation not only to utilize public expertise and experience, but also to increase the transparency, trust, and acceptability of government decisions. In this research we investigate how governments can increase citizens e-participation on social media. We collected 55,809 tweets over a period of one year from Twitter accounts of a progressive government in the Arab world. This was followed by statistical analysis of posts characteristics (Type, Day, Time) and their impact on citizens' engagement. Then, we evaluated how well can different machine learning techniques predict user engagement. Results of the statistical analysis confirmed that post type (video, image, link, and status) impacted citizens' engagement, with videos and images having the highest positive impact on engagement. Furthermore, posting government tweets on weekdays obtained higher citizens’ engagement than weekends. Conversely, time of post had a weak effect on engagement. The results from the machine learning experiments show that two techniques (Random Forest and Adaboost) produced more accurate predictions, particularly when tweet textual contents were also used in the prediction. These results can help governments increase the engagement of their citizens. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dubai government; Ensemble learning models; Machine learning; Mining government tweets; Post engagement; Twitter data","Adaptive boosting; Decision making; Decision trees; Learning systems; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Statistical methods; Accurate prediction; Dubai government; Ensemble learning; Government decisions; Machine learning techniques; Post engagement; Twitter data; Two way communications; Forecasting; Arab world; governance approach; local participation; machine learning; public attitude; social media; statistical analysis; Dubai [Dubai (ADS)]; Dubai [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075798729

Today, the question of good leadership has come under the spotlight again as a key factor shaping how successfully nations have dealt with the COVID-19 global health crisis. Amidst plummeting levels of public trust, the worst recession of the G7, and the highest death toll in Europe, the UK’s pandemic leadership response has faced especially stern accusations of incompetence and culpability for what has been described as the most catastrophic science policy failure for a generation. Addressing these issues, this paper argues for the adoption of a more pluralised UK leadership approach for handling COVID-19. Particularly, it is contended that as COVID-19 is a multifaceted problem that presents many varied and distributed challenges, UK leadership should employ a differentiated range of strategic mechanisms and processes to help improve substantive understandings and decision-making, support collective resilience, and build adaptive capacities as the crisis continues. The paper accordingly identifies and elaborates thirteen strategies, drawing on lessons and insights from the risk and crisis management field, that are proposed to serve as a useful heuristic to help guide UK pandemic leadership in this endeavour. To illustrate the value and application of each strategy, examples are provided of noteworthy leadership responses to COVID-19 observed internationally thus far, as well as leadership problems that have hampered the UK’s pandemic response. In conclusion, it is suggested that in as far as the conduct expected of leaders during a pandemic, or any other crisis, should maintain and be reflective of democratic values and standards of legitimacy, these strategies may also provide broadly applicable normative criteria against which leadership performance in handling COVID-19 may be judged as crisis ready. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; crisis communication; crisis management; leadership; risk communication; risk management; strategy","Engineering; Safety engineering; Adaptive capacity; Crisis management; Death tolls; Global health; Key factors; Public trust; Science policies; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096122577

This study evaluated the environmental performance of European Union (EU) countries using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach and the global Malmquist-Luenberger index. Although literature using the DEA approach to measure environmental performance exists, this study's main contribution was considering different types of undesirable outputs and using long-term panel data on EU countries. In particular, the DEA window analysis technique was applied to evaluate the environmental performance of 27 EU countries in cross-sectional and time-varying data during the period 2000–2017. Three DEA models were examined; labor, capital, and energy were used as common inputs with a combination of different outputs, including gross domestic product, carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions, and waste. The empirical results revealed that the trends in the environmental performance of the entire EU and its individual countries were similar under all examined models. Environmental performance was indeed negatively affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008; this impact was mainly observed in eastern EU countries. Furthermore, both economic and environmental variables significantly influenced countries’ overall efficiency. The analysis using the global Malmquist-Luenberger index elucidated that overall, EU countries experienced the efficiency improvement during the study period, although fluctuations were observed. These results enable countries and policymakers to understand their environmental performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and set targets for further improvement based on the current best practices of comparable peers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis; Environmental performance; Environmental variables; EU countries; Global malmquist-Luenberger index; Socioeconomic variables","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Efficiency improvement; Environmental efficiency; Environmental performance; Environmental variables; European Union countries; Gross domestic products; Malmquist-Luenberger indices; Particulate matter emissions; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089422379

This paper discusses the utilization of modelling and solving approaches based on the integration of simulation with metaheuristics. These 'simheuristic' algorithms, which constitute a natural extension of both metaheuristics and simulation techniques, should be used as a 'first-resort' method when addressing large-scale and NP-hard optimization problems under uncertainty -which is a frequent case in real-life applications.

Then we measure the societal impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagements using participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as a proxy. We demonstrate a robust and striking difference between public and private firms: whereas private firms significantly reduce their negative ESG incident levels after UNGC engagements, public firms fail to do so and are more likely to engage in decoupled CSR actions-actions with no subsequent real impact. We then conduct a series of in-depth analyses to examine possible economic mechanisms. Our results are most consistent with shareholder-stakeholder conflicts of interest being the main moderator of decoupling. The intensity of this conflict is further moderated by three factors: ownership type, proximity to final consumers on the value chain, and specific ESG incident types. Other possible mechanisms, such as selective entry into UNGC and heterogeneities in media exposure, country representation, and entry timing, do not survive our analysis. Our results suggest that existing CSR engagements and one-size-fits-all CSR policy mandates might not necessarily lead to better societal outcomes, and a multi-tiered policy targeting different ownership and industry types might be more efficient at maximizing ex post ESG benefits. © 2020 INFORMS","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental; Governance; Shareholder-stakeholder conflicts of interest; Social","Management; Operations research; Conflicts of interest; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Economic mechanisms; In-depth analysis; Outcome measures; Possible mechanisms; Societal impacts; United Nations; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087873525

Collecting data on firm-level innovation is challenging because of the difficulties to operationalize the definition of innovation, the subjective judgement calls that respondents are required to make because of this, and because what constitutes innovation may be considered differently across different country contexts. These challenges may lead to serious issues in innovation measurement. This paper contributes to the literature on measurement of innovation by uncovering significant differences in self-reporting innovation rates likely to result in mismeasurement. The first finding is that measures of innovation varies across survey instruments. Second, key elements explaining these differences are related to both framing issues and cognitive issues. Minimizing differences and potentially mismeasurement issues, therefore, requires ensuring good quality interviews but also facilitating good and consistent understanding of what is an innovation. Adding questions that collect more details describing innovation is critical to identifying inconsistencies in responses. While, the focus is on developing countries; the results of the study are also relevant to other countries and the overall literature on innovation survey design. © 2019","Economic development; Firms; Innovation; Measurement; Surveys","Developing countries; Measurement; Surveying; Economic development; Firms; Innovation measurements; Innovation rate; Self-reporting; Subjective judgement; Survey design; Survey instruments; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076632131

However, few studies have incorporated theoretical frameworks and there remains therefore a gap in literature. To fill this gap, the study reviews five theories on their suitability for supply chain finance: transaction cost economics, agency theory, network theory, collaborative networks and social exchange theory. A Scottish focus group consisting of practitioners involved in supply chain finance provided empirical data for the evaluation. The findings suggest that there is supporting evidence for using agency theory, network theory, transaction cost economics and social exchange theory as theoretical frameworks for studying phenomena of supply chain finance. Furthermore, the results indicate that the conceptualisations based on agency theory should be extended with ‘reverse principal–agent theory’ to fit with the contingencies of supply chain finance. The frameworks of collaborative networks are found less suitable. In addition to these theoretical considerations, the focus group discussion also points out that the financial department's collaboration with other departments involved in the primary supply chain process in firms needs to be improved. To achieve this training and supplier development, particularly for smaller firms, is seen as key. These outcomes have informed a research agenda for research groups, early career researchers and doctoral students. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agency theory; Collaborative networks; Financial supply chain management; Network theory; Social exchange theory; Supply chain finance; Transaction cost economics","Circuit theory; Economics; Network theory (graphs); Supply chain management; Agency theory; Collaborative network; Financial supply chains; Social exchange theory; Supply chain finances; Transaction cost economics; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070909007

We argue, however, that impact investing decisions may be prone to behavioral factors that limit their outcome efficiency. In a portfolio allocation task designed to reflect the essential features of an impact investing decision, we find across a range of scenarios that individuals systematically fail to choose investment portfolios that achieve financial and social outcomes efficiently and thereby waste opportunities for value creation. We further show in online and in-person experiments that outcome inefficiency is related to “categorical cognition”: suppression of categorical labels on investment options increases efficiency. Managerial Summary: The “impact investing” approach promises to encourage greater financial investments in hybrid organizations that pursue a combination of financial and social goals. We experimentally demonstrate a challenge of this approach: People struggle to identify portfolios of investments that simultaneously optimize across financial and social outcomes. This is partly due to “categorical cognition”: a natural tendency to view investments in terms of known categories rather than the actual outcomes they produce. Our experiments show that removing the labels “for-profit company,” “charity,” and “social enterprise” from investment options—thus making it more difficult to think about them categorically—increases outcome-efficient allocations. We therefore show that realizing the full potential of impact investing will require that investors transcend conventional thinking about business and charity as separate domains. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","behavioral economics; categorical cognition; hybrid organizations; impact investing; social enterprise","Efficiency; Investments; Nonprofit organization; Behavioral economics; categorical cognition; Efficient allocations; Financial investments; impact investing; Investment Options; Investment portfolio; Social enterprise; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074580619

This has prompted the call for a shift from the linear model of tackling the plastic waste issue to that of a Circular Economy model with increasing demand for recycled resin to be incorporated into the plastic production process alongside virgin resin. However, recycled content are often associated with problems like lack of stability between various combinations of virgin/recycle polymers, which may lead to variations in temperature and inconsistency in the ease of flow attributable to the different temperature and pressure regimes under which virgin raw material and recycled feedstock melt and cool. In this paper, our main contribution is a proposed framework for integrating an enhanced AI/DB interface for analysing historical and real time information/data into a joint DSC-TGA system that allows for simultaneous quality control checks and thermal stability tests on different virgin-recycled resin mixing ratios. The database comes equipped with proven estimation methods, testing and statistical analysis results of different resin specimens to serve as a reference point for production engineers in arriving at desired check and test conditions. The information will be particularly useful to plastic product manufacturers when making decisions regarding the right virgin-recycled mix ratio conditions when using different batches of recycled resin or when they switch a supplier. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Enhanced AI/DB interface; Intelligent database; Joint DSC-TGA system; Virgin-recycled polymer mix","Economics; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Quality control; Resins; British broadcasting corporations; Circular economy; Estimation methods; Plastic production; Product manufacturers; Real-time information; Technological innovation; Temperature and pressures; Plastics industry; polyethylene terephthalate; polymer; resin; conceptual framework; database; innovation; laboratory method; plastic waste; polymer; recycling; regression analysis; waste management; Article; chemical composition; composting; environmental economics; environmental monitoring; plastic industry; plastic waste; quality control; recycling; temperature sensitivity; thermal analysis; thermostability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089427873

C&G therapies offer transformative benefits to patients but present a challenge to current health technology decision-making systems because they are typically reviewed when clinical efficacy data are very limited and when there is uncertainty about the long-term durability of outcomes. These challenges are not unique to C&G therapies, but they face more of these barriers, reflecting the need for adapting existing value assessment frameworks. Still, C&G therapies have the potential to be cost-effective even at very high price points. The impact on healthcare budgets will depend on the success rate of pipeline assets and on the extent to which C&G therapies will expand to wider pathologies beyond rare or ultra-rare diseases. Getting pricing and reimbursement models right is important for incentivising research and development investment while not jeopardising the sustainability of healthcare systems. Payers and manufacturers therefore need to acknowledge each other’s constraints—limitations in the evidence generation on the manufacturer side, budget considerations on the payer side—and embrace innovative thinking and approaches to ensure timely delivery of therapies to patients.

For salespeople, demands of a connected workplace have largely eliminated boundaries between personal and work life, allowing stress from personal issues to spill over into their work. Thus, problems of health, relationships, and finances are no longer “left at home” for salespeople. Rather, a less central workplace model (e.g., remote workplaces and mobile platforms) and 24/7 work expectations expand the workplace, which comingles personal and work demands. Utilizing a sample of 331 salespeople, we study personal stressors that cross boundaries into the workplace and find that they play a critical role in the formation of burnout across its dimensions, which leads to reduced salesperson performance.

Business incubators are seen as important facilitators for innovation which provide office space, equipment, mentoring services, as well as financial, legal and administrative supports for technology entrepreneurs and start-up companies. Much investment has been undertaken to facilitate the development of business incubators, for example in financial frameworks, human resource development and communication infrastructure. This paper investigates the effects of business incubator capacities on the regional innovation performance, using a panel representing 31 Chinese provinces. This study finds that three capacities of business incubators have significant impacts on the regional innovation performance, while the incubation capacity appears to have a much greater effect than the basic capacity and the finance capacity. Moreover, this study also identifies that the regional communication infrastructure is an important moderator of the relationship between business incubator capacities and the regional innovation performance. This paper supports the view that emerging economies should encourage the development of business incubators in order to promote the development of technology entrepreneurs and domestic innovation performance, but more focus should be on creating free knowledge transfer platforms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Business incubator; China; Communication infrastructure; Performance; Regional innovation","Economics; Investments; Knowledge management; Office buildings; Business incubators; Communication infrastructure; Emerging economies; Human resource development; Innovation performance; Knowledge transfer; Regional innovation; Start-up companies; Regional planning; business development; entrepreneur; industrial performance; innovation; investment; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085596556

Policymakers tackling the coronavirus crisis have also been encouraged to prioritize policies which help mitigate a second, looming crisis: climate change. We identify and analyze policies that combat both the coronavirus crisis and the climate crisis. We analyze both the long-run climate impacts from coronavirus-related economic recovery policies, and the impacts of long-run climate policies on economic recovery and public health post-recession. We base our analysis on data on emissions, employment and corona-related layoffs across sectors, and on previous research. We show that, among climate policies, labor-intensive green infrastructure projects, planting trees, and in particular pricing carbon coupled with reduced labor taxation boost economic recovery. Among coronavirus policies, aiding services sectors (leisure services such as restaurants and culture, or professional services such as technology), education and the healthcare sector appear most promising, being labor intensive yet low-emission—if such sectoral aid is conditioned on being directed towards employment and on low-carbon supply chains.

Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors.

Most commonly-used model selection methods fail to consistently recover the true model when the covariates are highly correlated. Motivated by econometric and financial studies, we consider the case where covariate dependence can be reduced through the factor model, and propose a consistency strategy named Factor-Adjusted Regularized Model Selection (FarmSelect). By learning the latent factors and idiosyncratic components and using both of them as predictors, FarmSelect transforms the problem from model selection with highly correlated covariates to that with weakly correlated ones via lifting. Model selection consistency, as well as optimal rates of convergence, are obtained under mild conditions. Numerical studies demonstrate the nice finite sample performance in terms of both model selection and out-of-sample prediction. Moreover, our method is flexible in the sense that it pays no price for weakly correlated and uncorrelated cases. Our method is applicable to a wide range of high dimensional sparse regression problems.

To abate this scourge, various control methods including the use of technology have been adopted to improve workplace safety performance in construction. However, not all of the technologies adopted by industry personnel for safety management have achieved the desired outcome or have proved to be effective. More research is needed regarding the adoption of safety technologies in the construction industry. Importantly, industry stakeholders need to evaluate their readiness to adopt safety technologies. The present study develops a decision-making tool that can aid in the adoption of safety technology in the construction industry. The safety technology decision-making adoption tool is developed using the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and consists of three categories of safety technology predictors: external, organization, and technology-related. Technology-based predictors have emerged as the most impactful predictor. Subsequently, a technology adoption assessment protocol was developed and applied to a case study to assess an organization's readiness to adopt wearable sensing devices. The present work contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying, quantifying, and categorizing predictors of technology adoption and then integrating the predictors into an evaluation protocol to assess the adoption of safety technologies in the construction industry. This contribution is translated into practice by developing a user-friendly tool called the Construction Safety Technology Adoption Index (C-STAI). The developed tool is expected to help construction professionals and practitioners make informed decisions regarding the adoption of safety technology. Improved technology adoption in construction is expected to lead to enhanced safety and reduce injuries on construction projects. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Behavioral research; Construction industry; Decision making; Human resource management; Occupational risks; Wearable technology; Assessment protocols; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Construction safety; Decision making tool; Development and applications; Fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique; Industry stakeholders; Accident prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079575590

Selecting appropriate alliances, which are aligned with the company's strategies, establishes a situation through which the firms can enhance their technical capabilities and achieve new technologies. However, two critical issues in outsourcing modeling should be addressed: how to find strategic indicators for building successful alliances, and how to select these partners. Besides, as the imprecise and vague information (due to a lack of data) existing in the outsourcing models cannot be neglected, the application of fuzzy interval sets could efficiently address the complexity of these problems. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a two-step interval-based framework for the problem. At the beginning, and for the first time, the novel integration of an interval valued fuzzy (IVF) version of strength-weakness-opportunity-threats (SWOT) technique and the quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM) with Gap analysis is designed to find the most effective strategies for the alliance evaluation, and to weight them. In the next step, four interval-valued version of multiple criteria decision-making methods (IVF-MCDMs) are implemented to evaluate the strategic partners. Finally, the results are aggregated with the help of the utility interval approach, and a sensitivity analysis is implemented to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, a real partner selection problem at a holding car manufacturing factory in Iran is presented. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy interval modeling; MCDM; Outsourcing; Partner selection; Strategic alliances","Digital storage; Outsourcing; Sensitivity analysis; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; Company's strategy; Fuzzy interval; MCDM; Multiple criteria decision making; Partner selection; Strategic alliance; Strategic partners; Technical capabilities; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073948228

To design a circular and sustainable system, a structured approach is needed. In this study, we suggest to follow a 3-step approach. First, the status quo is evaluated using environmental assessment methods. We determine current circularity (share of assessed product and material retained and further used in the system), environmental impacts, the most impactful products and processes, and assess contaminants and impurities. Second, scenarios favoring circularity strategies are developed and their environmental impacts evaluated. Third, the scenarios are compared and measures for environmental impact mitigation derived. The suggested approach was applied to the case study of thermal insulation in residential buildings in Switzerland. Coupling dynamic, prospective material flow analysis with life cycle impact assessment enabled to determine current and future environmental impacts. Current material circularity is low due to lacking incentives for recycling and legally required incineration of flame retardant containing oil-based materials. The most impact-intensive processes were the production of insulation materials and the incineration of oil-based materials including their adhering residues. The investigated scenarios include (i) increased recycling, (ii) augmented use of biogenic materials, and (iii) a combination thereof. All scenarios lead to reduced climate change and human toxicity impacts. The second and third scenario showed increased impacts for land use, ozone depletion, and ecotoxicity. Taking into consideration end-of-life already in the design process, phasing out toxic materials, and increasing usage of renewable materials are crucial for sustainable, circular system design. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Circular design; Circular economy; Life cycle assessment; Recycling; Sustainability","Climate change; Design; Economics; Impurities; Incineration; Insulating materials; Land use; Life cycle; Ozone layer; Recycling; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Thermal insulation; Toxic materials; Circular designs; Circular economy; Development and applications; Environmental assessment methods; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Material flow analysis; Thermal insulation materials; Environmental impact; flame retardant; design; environmental impact assessment; insulation; life cycle analysis; recycling; residential location; sustainability; thermal structure; analytic method; Article; climate change; ecotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; flow measurement; human; incineration; land use; life cycle; mathematical model; ozone depletion; pollutant; process design; prospective study; recycling; residential area; Switzerland; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076564897

In this study, anticipated guilt is introduced into model of the Theory of Planned Behavior to compensate for neglect of emotional factors. Meanwhile, cultural values are taken as antecedent variables of the extended model to further explore the driving mechanism of residents’ intention of low carbon consuming behavior. By establishing structural equation model and using Mplus7.4 to analyze the data of 848 questionnaires from Jiangsu Province, it is found that: (1) when incorporated into the model of Theory of Planned Behavior, anticipated guilt has a positive and direct impact on intention of low carbon consuming behavior along with attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control; (2) attitude, perceived behavioral control and anticipated guilt play a positive and parallel multiple mediating role between collectivist value and intention of low carbon consuming behavior; (3) attitude and anticipated guilt play parallel multiple mediating role between man-to-nature orientation value and intention of low carbon consuming behavior. Among them, attitude plays a positive mediating role and anticipated guilt plays a negative mediating role. The present study provides empirical evidence for the effect mechanism of cultural values and emotions on the intention of low carbon consuming behavior, thus providing new ideas to mobilize the public's participation in low carbon consuming behaviors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anticipated guilt; Cultural values; Intention of low carbon consuming behavior; Theory of planned behavior","Carbon; Emission control; Surveys; Anticipated guilt; Carbon emission reductions; Cultural value; Intrinsic motivation; Low carbon; Perceived behavioral control; Structural equation modeling; Theory of Planned Behavior; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075525635

Its implementation varies substantially across countries, making it difficult to study and understand its impact on key policy objectives. Objectives: To assess the evidence on ERP in different settings and its impact on key health policy objectives, notably, cost-containment, pharmaceutical price levels, drug use, equity, efficiency, availability, affordability and industrial policy; and second, to critically assess the quality of evidence on ERP. Methods: Primary and secondary data collection through a survey of leading experts and a systematic literature review, respectively, over the 2000–2017 period. Results: Forty five studies were included in the systematic review (January 2000–December 2016). Primary evidence was gathered via survey distribution to experts in 21 countries (January–July 2017). ERP contributes to cost-containment, but this is a short-term effect highly dependent on the way ERP is designed and implemented. Low prices, as a result of ERP, can undermine the availability of medicines and lead to launch delays or product withdrawals. Downward price convergence can hamper investment in innovation. ERP does not seem to promote efficiency in achieving health system goals. As evidence is weak, results need to be interpreted with caution. Conclusions: ERP has not regulated prices efficiently and has unintended consequences that reduce the benefits arising from it. If ERP is carefully designed with minimal price revisions, prudent selection of basket size and countries, and consideration of transaction prices, it could be a more effective mechanism enhancing welfare, equitable access to medicines within countries and help promote industry innovation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Expert consultation; External reference pricing; Pharmaceutical policy; Pharmaceutical pricing; Regulation of pharmaceuticals; Systematic review","Article; cost control; drug use; health care availability; health care policy; health equity; human; investment; priority journal; systematic review; cost control; drug cost; drug dependence; economics; health care delivery; procedures; Cost Control; Drug Costs; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Substance-Related Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071568285

The literature on airport performance measurement is extensive but has tended to focus mainly on estimating the effects on efficiency from what are mostly endogenous variables. We undertake a two-stage analysis of 59 international airports observations in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. The first stage involves the use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure the efficiency of these airports. This is followed by a second stage, where we use a Truncated Regression model that incorporates the Simar and Wilson bootstrapping technique to test the extent to which a set of macro-environmental factors affect airport efficiency. Results reveal that a state's air transport sector output, institutional quality and robustness, the macro-economic environment, safety and security, and human development, all have a significant influence on the performance of airports. The result of this study fills the gap in the literature related to the non-discretionary variables affecting the performance of airports. It also suggests that policymakers and airport managers consider the identified factors when benchmarking airports. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Airports efficiency; DEA method; Exogenous factors; Macro-environmental factors; Tobit regression; Truncated regression","airport; bootstrapping; data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; environmental factor; performance assessment; regression analysis; Europe; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073975933

As with other management practices, implementation of CE can be supported by various factors. Among these factors are the so-called environmental-oriented supply chain cooperation (ESCC) practices. The study reported in this paper has three purposes. First, to investigate how the different levels of ESCC practices will affect the CE practices across the traditional wooden furniture industry in Central Java, Indonesia; second, to investigate the relationship between varying ESCC practices (which is grouped based on the implementation of CE practices) on the CE-targeted performances; and third, to examine the role of ESCC practices as a moderating variable in the relationship between CE practices and CE-targeted performances. This study uses primary data which were collected through closed questionnaires to 190 valid samples of wooden furniture SMEs across the cities of Jepara, Kudus, Rembang, Semarang, Blora and Surakarta. The data were processed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), K-means clustering analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and regression analysis. The results indicated that, depending on the levels of ESCC practices, the SMEs could be grouped into leaders, followers and laggard, which also determined the extent to which they practised the CE principles. The study also elaborated on the interactions between ESCC and CE practices, and how these might affect the CE-targeted environmental and economic performances. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","circular economy; economic performance; environmental performance; supply chain cooperation; Traditional wooden furniture","Environmental management; Factor analysis; K-means clustering; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Supply chain management; Surveys; Circular economy; Economic performance; Environmental performance; Supply chain cooperation; Traditional wooden furniture; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078601560

Innovation efficiency is derived by relating innovation inputs and innovation outputs. Expenditures in Research and Development and Human Capital stand for innovation inputs. Technological knowledge diffusion that comes from spatial and technological neighborhood stands for innovation output. We derive innovation efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis for 192 European regions for a 12-year period (1995–2006). We also examine the impact of patents production, development and employment level and the level of technological diversity on innovation efficiency using Structural Equation Modeling. This paper contributes a method of innovation efficiency estimation in terms of regional knowledge spillovers and causal relationship of efficiency measurement criteria. The study reveals that the regions presenting high innovation activities through patents production have higher innovation efficiency. Additionally, our findings show that the regions characterized by high levels of employment achieve innovation sources exploitation efficiently. Moreover, we find that the level of regional development has both a direct and indirect effect on innovation efficiency. More accurately, transition and less developed regions in terms of per capita GDP present high levels of efficiency if they innovate in specific and limited technological fields. On the other hand, the more developed regions can achieve high innovation efficiency if they follow a more decentralized innovation policy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Patents; R&D; Structural Equation Modeling; Technological diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038073914

Three types of supplier ties are considered: ties with external innovation partners, with customers outside the buying firm's industry, and with the buying firm's competitors. We posit that managers use supplier ties as signals to indicate a supplier's potential in contributing to innovation novelty or information protection. Results from two scenario-based experiments with practicing managers support most of our hypotheses. When innovation novelty is the goal, managers perceive other-industry customer ties and external innovation ties as positive signals, while competitor ties as a negative signal. When information protection is the goal, all three types of ties are perceived negatively. When both goals are considered, information protection has a greater influence than innovation novelty on the final supplier selection likelihood. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","behavioral experiment; conjoint analysis; information protection; innovation novelty; signaling theory; supplier selection; supplier ties","Managers; Sales; Behavioral experiment; Conjoint analysis; Information protection; Signaling theory; Supplier selection; supplier ties; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077848516

However, we lack understanding of how different sources of knowledge—namely knowledge from customers and partners—influence innovation. Grounded in the knowledge-based view of the firm, we theoretically develop and empirically test a model of mechanisms through which two forms of external knowledge acquisition i.e., customer co-creation and partner sourcing, foster knowledge creation and innovation. We posit that the different forms of external knowledge acquisition contribute differentially toward innovation outcomes. Finally, we examine the moderating role of knowledge dissemination capability on the relationships between external knowledge of both forms. We test our proposed model using data gathered from 655 organizations in two knowledge intensive sectors i.e., financial and information technology.

ISO 9001, in particular, provides a standard to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of processes. Similarly, network researchers argue that a firm's embedded position in the network plays a critical role in their competitiveness. Taking a network perspective, this research investigates if the productivity benefits of ISO 9001 depend, in part, on the network topology that connects the firm to their network partners. Using customer disclosure data from COMPUSTAT and ISO 9001, this study finds that network closure, industry homophily, and network centrality each moderate the effect of ISO 9001 on firm productivity.

However, there are still great challenges in modeling the complicated conditions in regional railway transportation: (1) Multiple types of data and knowledge in complicated correlations need to be analyzed, and (2) The approach must be open and accessible to decision makers so that a balanced decision can be made. To address the above challenges, a safety assessment approach using the hybrid Belief Rule Base (BRB) is proposed. In the new approach, multiple types of information are modeled under the hybrid assumption, and thus, hybrid rules are constructed to form the hybrid BRB. With this, both data and knowledge in complicated correlations can be used for the safety assessment on regional railway transportation, rather than only a single railway station or equipment component. Moreover, the assessment process remains open and accessible which provides good interpretability to stakeholders. An empirical regional railway safety assessment case is studied on the existing line and high speed line in the Cheng-Yu region located in the southwestern China. Five aspects, namely, the environment, equipment, management, passengers, and accident, are analyzed and then disintegrated into sub-factors. With the aspects and sub-factors, a comprehensive model is constructed. Case study results show that (1) the overall safety levels of the high speed line are better than the existing line, (2) the safety assessment results are consistent with the historical reports of accidents and system failures, (3) among all aspects, the environment and equipment have a more direct effect on the overall safety levels, and (4) consistency has also been found with railway accident statistics collected from Japan and Canada. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cheng-Yu region; Hybrid belief rule base; Railway safety assessment; Uncertainty","Decision making; Railroad accidents; Railroads; Systems engineering; Assessment process; Belief rule base; Cheng-Yu region; Comprehensive model; Railway safety; Railway transportation; Safety assessments; Uncertainty; Railroad transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078180414

Then, we present a method, free from consistency adjustment, to derive a priority vector using the multiplicative DEA cross-efficiency with respect to the given MPR. For GDM with IMPRs, we consider the decision makers’ weights as a uniform distribution for acceptability analysis. A modified unacceptability index is further defined to measure the unlikeliness for a particular alternative in a particular rank. Finally, we develop an assignment problem model to achieve an optimal ranking by minimizing the total rank unacceptability, and to compute the expected priority vector of all alternatives.

Due to the specific design of the wealth tax, the 1989 reform provides a compelling quasi-experiment for understanding behavioral responses among the wealthiest segments of the population. We find clear reduced-form effects of wealth taxes in the short and medium run, with larger effects on the very wealthy than on the moderately wealthy. We develop a simple life cycle model with utility of residual wealth (bequests) allowing us to interpret the evidence in terms of structural primitives. We calibrate the model to the quasi-experimental moments and simulate the model forward to estimate the long-run effect of wealth taxes on wealth accumulation.

However, there is a lack of research on the impact of technological innovation and technology introduction on the industrial green transformation of resource-based cities. To bridge this gap, this study uses the panel data of 115 resource-based cities in China from 2003 to 2016, and uses the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method to study the impact of technological innovation and technology introduction on industrial green transformation of resource-based cities. The results show that technology introduction has a negative effect on the industrial green transformation of resource-based cities, while technological innovation can have a positive effect. Meanwhile, technology introduction has imparted a greater role to technological innovation in promoting this transformation. In addition, the interactive effects between technological innovation and technology introduction have obvious heterogeneity on the industrial green transformation of different types of resource-based cities. Therefore, resource-based cities should continue to increase investment in scientific research, to constantly improve and consolidate their technological innovation ability, optimize foreign investment strategy in technology introduction, and strengthen the digestion and absorption of imported technology, while increasing technological innovation and personnel training. © Copyright © 2020 Xie, Yan, Xia and Chen.","China; industrial green transformation; resource-based cities; technological innovation; technology introduction","Engineering research; Green manufacturing; Industrial research; Investments; Metadata; Method of moments; Personnel training; Environmental pollutions; Generalized method of moments; Imported technologies; Industrial development; Technological innovation; Technological innovation ability; Technological progress; Technology introductions; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099038741

Initiatives to date have developed biodiversity indicators for specific business contexts (e.g., spatial scales—from site, to product, to regional, or corporate scales); however, many are not widely translatable across different contexts making it challenging for businesses seeking indicators to manage their biodiversity performance. By synthesising the steps of common conservation and business decision-making systems, we propose a framework to support more comprehensive development of quantitative biodiversity indicators, for a range of business contexts. The framework integrates experience from existing tried-and-tested conservation frameworks. We illustrate how our framework offers a pathway for businesses to assess their biodiversity performance and demonstrate responsible management by mitigating and reversing their biodiversity impacts and sustaining their dependencies, enabling them to demonstrate their contribution to emerging global biodiversity targets (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity post-2020 targets). © 2020 The Authors.

Using data on the universe of English school students, we exploit naturally occurring differences in achievement distributions across primary school classes to estimate the impact of class rank. We find large effects on test scores, confidence, and subject choice during secondary school, even though these students have a new set of peers and teachers who are unaware of the students' prior ranking in primary school. The effects are especially pronounced for boys, contributing to an observed gender gap in the number of Maths courses chosen at the end of secondary school. Using a basic model of student effort allocation across subjects, we distinguish between learning and non-cognitive skills mechanisms, finding support for the latter. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The CE is framed as a transformative model with economic, environmental and social benefits. Nevertheless, the degree of circularity in the global economy is low and critics highlight that current interpretations fall short in delivering promised results regarding the social dimension of sustainability. Instead economic growth is elevated above more radical socio-environmental transformation. This exploratory paper adopts a human needs approach, using Max-Neef's Human-Scale Development proposal as an analytical lens to explore the contentious social dimension of the CE. The study revisits four seminal texts which are commonly referenced as influencing the CE's conceptual development: The Blue Economy; Cradle to Cradle; Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development; and, The Performance Economy. These texts were analysed to identify satisfiers of human needs. This provides insight into how inclusive earlier visualisations were of encompassing human needs, and how these compare to the current CE direction. We argue that satisfiers of human needs are embedded, to differing extents, in some of the early CE depictions. Nevertheless, the CE concept has selectively developed, neglecting radical, human-centric transformational aspects and instead adheres to a familiar pathway of business-led economic growth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular Economy; Ecological modernization; Human-scale development; Sustainable development; Well-being","economic cycle; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental planning; global economy; human development index; social development; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088665508

Due to the fact that the reclaimed material is commonly perceived to have poorer quality than the virgin material, the pricing of materials and printed products are crucial for consumers to decide their printing and material selection decisions. We consider a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain comprising (1) a 3DP platform that provides 3DP services to print products from virgin and recycled materials, (2) material suppliers that provide virgin and recycled materials (filaments) for the platform, and (3) end users who use the platform to print their products. We derive the prices, demands, and profits of the 3DP platform and material suppliers in Stackelberg equilibrium. We also conduct numerical studies using real-life data to generate practical insights from the analytical findings. Most interestingly, we find that while the platform prefers, both types of suppliers avoid, printing high-quality products from recycled material.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study has focused on prioritizing these factors. Design/methodology/approach: First, this study conducts a multivocal literature review, and a total of 48 success factors (SFs) are identified and mapped into 11 categories. Second, the identified success factors and their categories are further validated by industry practitioners using a questionnaire survey approach. Finally, this study applies an analytical hierarchy process to prioritize the identified SFs and their categories and to assess their importance for successful blockchain implementation in the supply chain management process. Findings: The “Accessibility” category has the highest importance, and the “Overall efficiency” category has the second highest rank. As far as the success factors are concerned, “Trackability” and “Traceability” are considered to be the prime success factors of a blockchain-based supply chain. The taxonomy of the categories and their success factors provide an outline for supply chain organizations to establish a strategy to implement blockchain technology. Practical implications: This technology can be practically applied in a sustainable supply chain. Another vital application of this blockchain technology is in banking and finance because of the blockchain's immutable data recording property. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no previous study focused on building a taxonomic model that allows supply chain organizations to compare this paper's model with existing models and outline the necessary actions to improve supply chain activities. The questionnaire-based survey developed to validate the success factors in real-world practices and the factors' prioritization can help academic researchers and industrial practitioners to set their strategic goals accordingly. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytic hierarchy process; Blockchain; Success factors; Supply chain management","Fintech; Supply chain management; Surveys; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Design/methodology/approach; Industrial practitioners; Integrated frameworks; Questionnaire surveys; Real-world practice; Recording properties; Sustainable supply chains; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092696057

Academic/practical relevance: To investigate this issue, we study a capacity investment problem for a utility firm that invests in renewable and conventional energy, with a consideration of two critical factors. First, conventional sources have different levels of operational flexibility-inflexible (e.g., nuclear and coal) and flexible (e.g., natural gas). Second, randomrenewable energy supply and electricity demand are correlated and nonstationary. Methodology: We model this problem as a two-stage stochastic program in which a utility firm first determines the capacity investment levels followed by the dispatch quantities of energy sources to minimize the sum of investment and generation-related costs. Results: We derive the optimal capacity portfolio to characterize the interactions between renewable and conventional sources. Policy implications: We find that renewable and inflexible sources are substitutes, suggesting that a subsidy for nuclear or coal-fired power plants leads to a lower investment level in wind or solar energy. However, wind energy and flexible sources are complements. Thus, a subsidy for flexible natural gas-fired power plants leads to a higher investment in wind energy. This result holds for solar energy if the subsidy for the flexible source is sufficiently high. We validate these insights by using real electricity generation and demand data from the state of Texas. © 2020 INFORMS.","capacity investment; renewable energy; volume flexibility","Coal; Coal industry; Fossil fuel power plants; Natural gasoline plants; Nuclear power plants; Public policy; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Coal-fired power plant; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Natural gas fired power plants; Operational flexibility; Policy implications; Renewable and conventional energies; Two-stage stochastic programs; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089344930

This is to evade risks and enable government departments to formulate appropriate agricultural regulations and policies. This study employs the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) technique to decompose six different categories of agricultural futures prices. Subsequently, three models—support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)—are used to predict the decomposition components. The final hybrid model is then constructed by comparing the prediction performance of the decomposition components. The predicting performance of the combination model is then compared with the benchmark individual models: SVM, NN, and ARIMA. Our main interest in this study is on short-term forecasting, and thus we only consider 1-day and 3-day forecast horizons. The results indicate that the prediction performance of the EEMD combined model is better than that of individual models, especially for the 3-day forecasting horizon. The study also concluded that the machine learning methods outperform the statistical methods in forecasting high-frequency volatile components.

Moreover, this study incorporates user experience as a moderator, in order to explore behavioral differences between veterans (high-experience users) and newbies (low-experience users). Design/methodology/approach: A research model was developed to examine the influences of three technology affordances: interactivity, information and navigation on user satisfaction and SNS stickiness. Totally 266 data were collected from a famous college in China using an online survey, and structural equation modeling technique was used to examine the proposed research model. Findings: The empirical research findings indicated that the three technology affordance attributes exhibited different degrees of influence on user satisfaction, which in turn facilitated SNS stickiness. Particularly, high-experience users were more likely influenced by interactivity and information affordances, while low-experience users are more susceptible to navigation affordance. Practical implications: This study can provide guidelines to the platform administrators to design SNSs from the aspects of interactivity, information and navigation attributes and pay attention to the preference differences between high-experience users and low-experience users.

This paper addresses the performance of global roundwood markets by evaluating the order of market integration in the United States (the South and Pacific Northwest), New Zealand, Brazil, South Africa, Sweden, Chile, Canada, Finland and Austria. An overview of each of these wood markets is provided and quarterly data of delivered prices are evaluated over the period 1995Q1-2017Q4. Various unit root tests and Johansen's cointegration tests have been computed. Results show that in general non-coniferous and coniferous wood markets are not integrated. However, it was found that the law of one price seems to hold for coniferous sawlog prices between Sweden and Finland, and non-coniferous pulpwood prices of wattle and eucalyptus species in South Africa. It was concluded that probably due to a lack of perfect substitutability of roundwood products and significant transaction costs among trading regions, global roundwood markets are characterized by relatively moderate correlations and a lack of cointegration, which indicates an apparent independence of these markets. These findings are important to timberland investment managers as they support the concept of market diversification within international investment portfolios. © 2020","Cointegration analysis; Global roundwood markets; Wood prices","Commerce; Investments; Co-integration tests; Cointegration analysis; International investments; Investment managers; Law of one prices; Market integration; Roundwood markets; Wood prices; Costs; Commerce; Costs; Finland; Integration; Investment; Prices; South Africa; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082136300

However, it is difficult for consumers to discern the authenticity of a review or the reviewer's level of experience with the product. Platforms can aid the authentication process by incorporating a verified purchase (VP) indication, or “badge” as is done on Amazon, in reviews where the consumer writing the review has verifiably purchased the focal product. A VP is a revealed preference for a product implying a utility-maximizing choice where the consumer writing the review has experience with the product. Combining an Amazon dataset on tablet computers with the theory of revealed preference in online reviews, we uncover a surprising new result: the proportion of VP reviews (a revealed preference) is associated with higher future sales, and the effect of the proportion of VP reviews on sales dominates the effect of the mean rating. This novel use of VP with revealed preference theory has implications for new research in the design of recommendation systems, detecting fraudulent reviews, and online profiling/privacy. Moreover, the use of a VP badge is immediately applicable to firms and platforms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Online word-of-mouth; Platform strategy; Product review; Revealed preference; Trust; Verified purchase","Authentication; Sales; Online word of mouths; Platform strategy; Product reviews; Revealed preference; Trust; Online systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081973949

Acknowledging the multidimensional nature of SME growth, this study tests an approach to measure SME institutional environment quality through the identification of regional-level determinants. Design/methodology/approach: The method used in this paper is based on Bruns et al.’s (2017) model and is tested on 81 Russian Federation regions. The approach seeks to determine variation in entrepreneurial ecosystems based on quality and estimated marginal effects of difference across geographical regions. Findings: The most severe obstacle to SME development in Russia is its shadow economy and corruption. Access to finance, high transportation fees, and instability in the political and economic field ranks second and third, respectively. Results suggest governments should eliminate main obstacles at country-level, which hampers the SME sector's development. While this is noted for this case looking at Russia, this is a common argument found in SME research. Practical implications: Findings from this study are useful in managerial practice, aimed at increasing innovative development and increasing the competitiveness of Russian SMEs. A neo-institutional approach is one of the theoretical strands with the emphasis on enhanced understanding of organizational behavior and social capital, including cultural norms and beliefs.

To this end, we conceptualize and quantify two types of firms' communication actions on social media: posts and responses to customer messages. Furthermore, we classify a firm's responses to customer messages based on the valence of customer messages'positive versus negative'and examine the effects of volume as well as timeliness of the two types of a firm's responses to customer messages on firm performance. Using a sample of 63 South Korean firms across industries over a three-year period (5,566 firm-week observations), we find that the volume and timeliness of a firm's responses to negative customer messages, which are associated with an increase in customer satisfaction, have a significant positive impact on the firm's market performance measured by abnormal returns and Tobin's q. Interestingly, the results suggest that a firm's posts and its responses to positive customer messages are not significantly associated with firm performance. Furthermore, we find that a firm's posts and its responses to negative customer messages exhibit complementarities in contributing to firm performance. Our results are robust to various alternative specifications, econometric concerns, and Facebook's policy changes, such as EdgeRank and Promoted Post. Our findings underscore the business value of firms' actions on social media and provide unique and important implications for theory and practice regarding the appropriate ways to use social media for building and managing customer relationships.

Yet, the supply of such opportunities has been slow to materialize despite a proliferation of impact funds and other sustainability-focused funders seeking to direct global capital flows into the sector. This can be explained, in part, by the heterogeneous, multi-layered, and fragmented nature of agricultural production systems and food value chains and the poorly developed knowledge systems available to inform new types of investment. The volume of sustainability-oriented investment in the food and agriculture sector is likely to be hampered by the absence of a robust scientific evidence base and well-designed tools (e.g. indices and other benchmarking mechanisms) for harnessing knowledge to investment decision processes. At present, indicator-based tools for incorporating sustainability into agricultural value chains are being developed without adequate engagement by scientists. Collaborative co-development of decision tools by researchers and corporate and financial actors, that draws upon their distinct needs and knowledge sets, can improve the utility of these tools for real-world application (e.g. assessing non-financial returns; mitigating reputational risk). This paper proposes new requirements and strategies for the scientific community to contribute to co-development of science-based indicators and other decision tools that better enable agri-sector companies and investors to integrate food system sustainability considerations into management and capital allocation. It will present early lessons from multi-sector engagement in construction of indices, such as the Agrobiodiversity Index (ABDI), and review new modes for research institutions to engage with private sector partners. © 2019 The Authors","Agri-food sector; Agrobiodiversity; Decision-making tool; Green bonds; Green investment; Impact investment; Sustainable finance; Sustainable food systems","Deforestation; Investments; Planning; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Agricultural production system; Agrobiodiversity; Decision making tool; Food sector; Food system; Research institutions; Scientific community; Sustainable investments; Decision making; agricultural market; agricultural production; benchmarking; biodiversity; decision making; heterogeneity; investment; private sector; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076413952

The mildly explosive/multiple bubbles testing strategy by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015, International Economic Review 56(4), 1043–1133) is used to test for price departures from an underlying stochastic trend and to assess whether any such departures can be explained by fundamentals or other proxy variables. The test dates two significant time periods in both Brent and WTI nominal and real front-month futures prices: a mildly explosive episode during the 2007–08 spike, prior to the peak of the Global Financial Crisis; and a significantly shorter, negative such episode during the 2014–16 price decline, whose commencement is dated around a key OPEC meeting in November 2014. Evidence using other commodity prices points to explanatory factors beyond commodity markets. A global economic activity proxy is found to be decisive in the episode in mid-2008; excess speculation is not. U.S. shale oil production, though contributing to the post-June 2014 price decline, is not seen to have been decisive. Against some recent work tying the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) to oil futures prices, we find no evidence that the VIX decisively affected oil price levels during the sample period. The results are compared and contrasted with those obtained by Baumeister and Kilian (2016, Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists 3, 131-158) via a forecasting approach based on a structural vector autoregressive model without financial variables.

Evidence suggests, however, that imprints are sometimes reprioritized or modified, implying that they can be strategically managed. We draw upon rhetorical history research and an in-depth historical case study of New Zealand's Gallagher Group to describe how one firm managed its imprints. Our inductive theorizing links historically imprinted strategic guideposts to decision-making via two rearranging processes—that is, prioritizing and suspending—wherein managers use narratives to rearrange guideposts' influence and two scope modifying processes—that is, constraining and expanding—wherein managers change where guideposts apply. As a first explanation of how imprints are managed, these processes add nuance to existing theory and open new research avenues regarding additional processes and boundary conditions. Managerial Summary: Imprints are elements of culture, strategy, structure, or decision-making that emerge when the firm is founded or during times of turmoil. Imprints resist change and make organizational adaptation difficult. This study explains one way that managers manipulate imprinted decision-making rules so that organizations can adapt. Using an in-depth historical case study of New Zealand's Gallagher Group from 1938 to 2015, we follow four imprinted decision-making rules that we call strategic guideposts and show how managers rhetorically revised these rules to adapt organizational decision-making to changing environments. Managers prioritized some decision-making rules while deemphasizing others or they changed their claims about the kinds of decisions where a decision-rule applied. Knowing these rhetorical processes can help managers leverage their organization's history to facilitate necessary organizational change. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","imprinting theory; qualitative study; rhetorical history; strategic guideposts","Managers; Changing environment; Decision-making rules; imprinting theory; Organizational adaptation; Organizational change; Organizational decision making; Qualitative study; strategic guideposts; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065512353

Firstly, productivity differences between the source and recipient firms have been found to drive these spillovers; secondly, previous evidence suggests that labor flows from multinational enterprises provide productivity gains for firms; and thirdly, industry relatedness across firms have been found important, because industry-specific skills have an impact on organizational learning and production. In this paper, we aim to disentangle the effects of productivity gap, multinational experience and industry relatedness in a common framework. Hungarian employee–employer linked panel data from 2003–2011 imply that the incoming labor from more productive firms is associated with increasing future productivity.

In order to test these hypotheses, the study relies on an econometric model by using data from 487 Italian manufacturing companies collected by a questionnaire-based survey. The empirical model based on a multivariate regression reveals that companies which perceive normative and mimetic pressures are more likely to have a higher climate change sensitivity. Moreover, companies with a higher climate change sensitivity are more likely to adopt both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The article provides several contributions. First the study contributes to the debate among institutional scholars by clarifying which institutional pressures exert a more incisive effect on pushing companies to adopt climate actions. Second, it highlights how internal factors play a mediating role between institutional pressures and business climate responses. © 2019","Climate change sensitivity; Institutional pressures; Isomorphic pressures; Survey","Climate models; Regression analysis; Surveying; Surveys; Adaptation strategies; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Institutional pressures; Institutional theory; Manufacturing companies; Mimetic pressures; Multivariate regression; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073740889

Design/methodology/approach: This research focuses on these aspects through the expectation disconfirmation theoretical lens, looking at the relationship between expectations shaped by the product return policy and the repurchase intention. This research collects data using a survey approach and analyzes it using structural equation modeling. Findings: It was found that perceived return policy leniency, perceived fairness of the return experience and perceived quality of the return experience are important and supporting factors that influence a customer’s intention to be a return customer to e-tailers. Perceived leniency was found to not only be the most influential factor for return purchase intention but it also significantly impacted the perceived fairness and the quality of the return process. As a result, perceived leniency of the return policy had a “halo” effect on the other factors. Practical implications: This suggests that the majority of an e-tailer’s effort should be expended determining a return policy and experience that is widely perceived as lenient as this will overall improve customer perception of the return process and increase repurchase intention. Originality/value: This research extends research on lenient policy within the growing e-tailer sector by examining the return experience of the customer and subsequent repurchase intention based on multiple factors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Expectation disconfirmation; Online retailing; Repurchase intention; Return policy; Structural equation modelling","Product design; Expectation disconfirmation; Online retailing; Repurchase intention; Return policy; Structural equation modelling; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076060101

To a successful transition to industry 4.0, implementation strategies should be selected with a systematic and comprehensive view to responding to the changes flexibly. This research aims to identify and prioritise the strategies for implementing industry 4.0. For this purpose, at first, evaluation attributes of strategies and also strategies to put industry 4.0 in practice are recognised. Then, the attributes are weighted to the experts’ opinion by using the Best Worst Method (B.W.M.). Subsequently, the strategies for implementing industry 4.0 in Fara-Sanat Company, as a case study, have been ranked based on the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy (I.V.I.F) of the T.O.D.I.M. method. The results indicated that the attributes of ‘Technology’, ‘Quality’, and ‘Operation’ have respectively the highest importance. Furthermore, the strategies for “new business models development’, ‘Improving information systems’ and ‘Human resource management’ received a higher rank. Eventually, some research and executive recommendations are provided. Having strategies for implementing industry 4.0 is a very important solution. Accordingly, multi-criteria decision-making (M.C.D.M.) methods are a useful tool for adopting and selecting appropriate strategies.

In this type of environments, sub-DMUs are considered when assessing the efficiency of the main DMU, which helps evaluating the internal structure of the DMUs. The proposed method is applied to measure the productivity of several Iranian oil refineries. After identifying the main factors determining the productivity of these refineries, the operation of nine of them is analyzed using data from the 2015–2016 period. The results show that the management of resource utilization, particularly capital and energy, is inappropriate and investment insufficient. In particular, investment does not aim at upgrading the technology level, despite the fact that the depreciation rate of capital facilities is particularly high in this industry. This particular feature highlights the need to increase the rate of investment in order to replace the depreciated capital. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crude oil distillation unit; Data envelopment analysis; Malmquist productivity index; Network DEA; Oil refinery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077294258

The creation of relational capital (RC) within a firm is a well-researched concept; however, few studies investigated the customer/supplier leveraging mechanisms that build relational capital in SCs. In this study, we propose a model to examine the effects of supplier and customer leveraging on the creation of RC, which impacts innovation performance (IP). The empirical data for this study were drawn from the fifth round of the Global Manufacturing Research Group survey project (data collected from 557 manufacturing plants, in 10 countries). The hypotheses were empirically tested using structural equation modelling. The findings highlight the importance of SC leveraging towards building RC, in order to enhance innovation performance. The results show that supplier and customer leveraging positively impact the RC. In turn, the RC has a significant impact on IP. We found that the effect of SC leveraging directly and indirectly (partial mediated by RC) associates with the innovation performance. These findings are underpinned by the relational view, which argues that the relationships between firms are an important unit of analysis for understanding competitive advantage. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","innovation performance; relational capital; supplier and customer leveraging; supply chain","capital formation; empirical analysis; innovation; manufacturing; numerical model; performance assessment; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087672494

This paper presents a quantitative, holistic framework to systematically estimate life-cycle impacts and costs associated with e-waste management. This new framework was tested using data from the state of Washington's EPR program to represent e-waste collection, transportation, processing and disposal. Sensitivity of process-level life-cycle model outputs to parameter and input variability was also conducted. Drop-off using fossil-fuel-powered personal vehicles was found to be a key contributor to cost and carbon dioxide emissions. Decision-makers must account for drop-off and consider the feasibility of alternate e-waste aggregation strategies to ensure life-cycle benefits of e-waste recycling are maximized. © 2020","electronic waste; end-of-life management; life cycle assessment; life-cycle model; producer responsibility; waste management","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Drops; Electronic Waste; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Life cycle; Materials handling; Recycling; Software testing; Waste disposal; Wastes; Aggregation strategy; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electronic waste (e waste); Extended producer responsibility; Holistic frameworks; Life cycle impacts; Recycling process; Waste management systems; Electronic equipment; corporate social responsibility; cost analysis; electronic waste; holistic approach; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost; e-waste; life cycle; motor vehicle; recycling; waste collection; waste disposal; waste management; waste processing; waste transportation; District of Columbia; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086084470

Firstly, we introduce various feature selection techniques including filter, wrapper and embedded methods, to identify key factors that affect crude oil price and construct different granular spaces. Secondly, distinct feature subsets distinguished by different feature selection methods are incorporated to generate individual forecasts using three popular forecasting models including Linear regression (LR), Artificial neural network (ANN) and Support vector machine (SVR). Finally, the final forecasts are obtained by combining the forecasts from individual forecasting model in each granular space and the optimal weighting vector is achieved by artificial bee colony (ABC) techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-granularity heterogeneous combination approach based on ABC can outperform not only individual competitive benchmarks but also single-granularity heterogeneous and multi-granularity homogenous approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial bee colony; Crude oil Price; Feature selection; Forecast combination; Multi-granularity","Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Vector spaces; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Combination approaches; Crude oil price forecasting; Feature selection methods; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting modeling; Nonlinear complexity; Optimal weighting vector; Crude oil price; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; competitiveness; crude oil; energy market; forecasting method; oil supply; price dynamics; support vector machine; Apoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089599926

Various approaches have been implemented to reduce the industry's carbon footprint. With over 40 million wine tourists globally, cellar door operations have become an important distribution channel, especially for the financial sustainability of small and medium-sized wineries, but this component has not been addressed in existing environmental life cycle assessments. This paper presents a methodology for measuring the carbon footprint of wine tourism and cellar door sales based on a combination of the bottom-up and the top-down approaches. In the case of Australia, we find both domestic and international wine tourism lead to substantially higher carbon emissions than the standard wine distribution channels.

We construct a model that recommends a personalized discounted product bundle to an online shopper that considers the trade-off between profit maximization and inventory management, while selecting products that are relevant to the consumer's preferences. Academic/ practical relevance: We provide analytical performance guarantees that illustrate the complexity of the underlying problem, which combines assortment optimization with pricing. We implement our algorithms in two separate case studies on actual data from a large U.S. e-tailer and a premier global airline. Methodology: We focus on simultaneously balancing personalization through individualized functions of consumer propensity-to-buy, inventory management for long-run profitability, and tractability for practical business implementation. We develop two classes of approximation algorithms, multiplicative and additive, to produce a real-time output for use in an online setting. Results: Our computational results demonstrate significant lifts in expected revenues over current industry pricing strategies on the order of 2%-7% depending on the setting. We find that on average our best algorithm obtains 92% of the expected revenue of a full-knowledge clairvoyant strategy across all inventory settings, and in the best cases this improves to 98%. Managerial implications: We compare the algorithms and find that the multiplicative approach is relatively easier to implement and on average empirically obtains expected revenues within 1%-6% of the additive methods when both are compared with a full-knowledge strategy. Furthermore, we find that the greatest expected gains in revenue come from high-end consumers with lower price sensitivities, and that predicted improvements in sales volume depend on product category and are a result of providing relevant recommendations. © 2019 INFORMS","Dynamic programming; Inventory theory and control; OM practice; Pricing and revenue management; Retailing","Additives; Approximation algorithms; Economic and social effects; Electronic commerce; Inventory control; Online systems; Profitability; Analytical performance; Assortment optimization; Consumer propensities; Consumer's preferences; Managerial implications; Multiplicative approach; Product recommendation system; Separate case studies; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092638286

Yet little is known about the magnitude with which these place-based policy interventions shift the performance trajectories of entrepreneurial firms. We provide new evidence based on 241 startups that compete for advanced research and technology commercialization loans between 2002 and 2008 through a Michigan-based program. Among applicants with project scores near the threshold required for funding, we find that award recipients are 20%–30% more likely to remain in business four years after the competition relative to similar companies that seek but fail to receive funding. We also find that award receipt stimulates follow-on venture capital (VC) investments in surviving companies. The VC stimulus effect is, however, disproportionately driven by subsets of firms that are very young, relatively inexperienced at external fundraising, or located outside the dominant hub of entrepreneurial activity within the state. This distinctive pattern of heterogeneous effects remains visible for follow-on R&D financing from federal government sources, and for supplemental outcome measures that use news articles to track shifts in financing and business development activities. These findings are consistent with the view that public R&D programs are particularly beneficial when frictions in private resource markets are more severe. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation policy; R&D subsidies; Startup performance","Competition; Investments; Business development; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurial firms; Entrepreneurship; Heterogeneous effects; Innovation policies; Start-up performance; Technology commercializations; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079043318

Allocation of the total emissions reduction target among various entities is an issue of both theoretical importance and practical significance. Based on efficiency analysis, this paper proposes a methodology to develop an iterative procedure that can realize the disaggregation of emissions allowance. We use China as a typical case to illustrate our methodology, and disaggregate China's national reduction target of carbon dioxide emissions into targets applicable at the provincial level. Our results indicate that economically well-developed entities exhibit smaller percentages in carbon reductions. In contrast, less-developed entities should lower their carbon emissions by significant amounts, since their economic growth rates do not align with the huge amounts of ecological consumption. By implementing the proposed allocation scheme, the cross-performance of all involved entities will achieve the best state. The proposed method is readily applicable to general scenarios including nations, industries and enterprises. The results could support decision makers in developing an equitable and easy-to-operate allocation scheme of emissions allowance among various entities. The findings from the case study can be generalized to a global level that economic development and emissions status quos affect the scales of emissions reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reduction; Data envelopment analysis; Directional distance function; Efficiency","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Economics; Efficiency; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Iterative methods; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Developing nations; Directional distance function; Economic development; Economic growth rate; Efficiency analysis; Emissions reduction; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076522789

We analysed 621 k emails exchanged between 2009 and 2018.

These clusters and associated discussion trends were linked to the company's revenues and financial performance, showing good predictive power.

The results of the RCT research programme to evaluate CLTS and related sanitation interventions suggest that the magnitude of the treatment effects was much smaller and uncertain than proponents once anticipated. For example, of the ten studies that reported results for reductions in childhood diarrhoea, only three found statistically significant decreases. Surprisingly, the RCT research teams and their funders do not seem to have thought about how their multi-million dollar research agenda would support decision-making on sanitation. Information on the parameters needed for cost-effectiveness analysis or benefit-cost analysis was not collected. However, making reasonable assumptions about the missing information on parameter values, we show that cost-benefit analysis may still 'save' CLTS because small treatment effects may still yield net positive economic benefits if the costs of implementing CLTS programmes are modest. We also discuss the need to move beyond the desire for sanitation policies that are proven to be effective globally, and the importance of focusing on analysis of the local sanitation situation. We describe the data needed to make this shift in policy focus from the global to the local level and stress the importance of interdisciplinary communication between the proponents of RCTs and 'evidence-based policy', and economists who will be responsible for the economic analysis of investments in CLTS and other sanitation interventions. We also argue that the results of these RCTs highlight the importance of coordinating investments in piped water and sanitation with investments in improved housing. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the existing literature did not pay enough attention in interrogating the impacts of Carbon Tax (CT) and Carbon Quota (CQ) policy on distribution costs and carbon dioxide emission in the field of vehicle routing problem. Moreover, the investigated subsidies factor is also incomplete. This research stands on the position of the company to study the impact of CT and CQ policy on aforementioned two aspects. A mathematical model is developed to achieve the best low carbon vehicle routing under the optimal policy. The optimization goal of this research is to minimize the total cost that includes vehicle-using, transportation, CT, CQ, and raw material subsidy costs. An improved optimization algorithm, namely Genetic Algorithm-Tabu Search (GA-TS), is proposed to solve a given business case. In the simulation experiments, GA-TS and a traditional GA are compared and the results show the advantage of GA-TS on reducing the total cost and carbon dioxide emission. Furthermore, the experiments also explore the total cost and carbon dioxide emission under three scenarios (Benchmark, CT and CQ), incorporating four policies: CT, Carbon Tax Subsidy (CTS), CQ, and Carbon Quota Subsidy (CQS). It is concluded that CQS is the ideal policy to minimize distribution cost and carbon dioxide emission. In addition, the impact of vehicles’ capacities on the total cost and carbon dioxide emission is also analyzed in this research. This research also aimed at assisting practitioners in better formulating delivery routes, as well as policy makers in developing carbon policies.

We contextualize history and illustrate the negative effect of historical conflict on cross-border deals. Nation-dyads with historical conflict incorporate negative sentiments into their social and collective memories and national identities. Members of society assume the socially constructed national identity via primary and secondary socialization. National identities incorporate sentiments towards other nations and condition individuals' preferences, culminating in a preference-biased search for or preference-supporting evaluation of information concerning cross-border deals. An increased generational distance from prior conflict and a higher percentage of graduates with common professional identities constructed by higher education in the social sciences, law, and business dampen the negative influence of historical conflict. Managerial Summary: There is a reciprocal relationship between international trade and conflict across two nations: as the potential for conflict increases, trade levels fall, and as trade levels increase, the potential for conflict rises. We disentangle this relationship and determine the implications of historical conflict between two nations for cross-border corporate deals (i.e., acquisitions/joint ventures/alliances). We show that, controlling for other factors, more frequent historical conflict discourages cross-border corporate deals. We see this finding as a result of biased decision making based on preferences which reflect sentiments formed by national identities. Two mechanisms dampen the negative relationship between binational conflict and cross-border deals: a higher percentage of business/law/social sciences graduates and a higher number of generations passed since the last conflict. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","conflict; cross-border deals; decision making; history; identities; international relations and trade; sentiments; socialization","Behavioral research; Decision making; History; International trade; conflict; Cross-border; identities; International relations; sentiments; socialization; Mergers and acquisitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067874238

By its geographical position, Nicaragua is one of the countries most affected by climate change, and coffee production is expected to vastly shrink in some critical areas, suitability being reduced by up to 40% in the country. This paper analyses farmer's perceptions and vulnerability indicators to find which indicators are linked to farmers’ perceived capacity to adapt to climate change, paying special attention to the issue of whether farmers perceive they have any capacity at all to adapt. The analysis was conducted through a survey to 212 representative farmers jointly with an analysis of vulnerability indicators. A Heckman selection model was estimated to jointly analyse the probability of being able to cope with climate change and the level of adaptive capacity that farmers perceive. We have simulated different policy scenarios considering the sustainable development goals of United Nations in terms of poverty reduction and education concerns. We also analysed the effects of specific programs on education about climate change awareness. Finally, we extend our analysis to a geographical evaluation of the farmer's perceived vulnerability. The analysis shows that aspects such as farm size or education levels are relevant for modulating farmers’ perceptions on their own adaptive capacity. Large farm managers find themselves more often able to cope with climate change impacts though they find their capacity to be limited. Farmers that could not rely on rainfall water for their plantations also reported being less able to cope with climate change impacts. Poverty was also found to be correlated to perceptions, as regions lower proportions of inhabitants under poverty levels showed higher levels of confidence in adaptive capacity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral economics; Climate change adaptive capacity; Coffee production; Heckman selection model; Mesoamerica; Vulnerability indicators","adaptive management; climate change; coffee; farmers attitude; numerical model; perception; vulnerability; Mesoamerica; Nicaragua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074248288

Objective: This study aims at exploring the important factors that affect the compliance behavior of informal sector workers (PBPU members) in regularly paying their insurance premium. This analysis may be a basis for designing effective measures to encourage payment sustainability in informal sector workers in the NHIS. Method: This study utilizes the survey data collected from three regional offices of the Indonesian Social Security Agency for Health (SSAH), which cover approximately 1210 PBPU members, to understand the relationship between members’ characteristics and their compliance behavior regarding the premium payment. We applied an econometric analysis of a logit regression to statistically estimate which factors most affect their compliance behavior in paying the insurance premium. Results: This study reveals that almost 28% of PBPU members do not pay their insurance premiums in a sustainable way. Our logistic regression statistically confirms that the number of household members, financial hardship, membership in other social protection arrangements, and the utilization of health services are negatively correlated with the compliance rate of informal sector workers in paying their insurance premium. For instance, people who experience financial hardship tend to have a 7.7 percentage point lower probability of routinely paying the premium. In contrast, households that work in agricultural sectors and have income stability, the cost of inpatient care incurred before joining the NHIS, a comprehensive knowledge of the SSAH’s services, and the availability of health professionals are all positively correlated with regular premium payment. Conclusion: Although there is no single policy that can ensure that informal sector workers (PBPU members) regularly pay their premiums, this study recommends some policy interventions, including (1) flexibility in applying for a government subsidy for premiums (Penerima Bantuan Iuran [PBI]), especially for people who have financial hardship; (2) an intensive promotion of insurance literacy; (3) expanding the quantity and quality of healthcare services; and (4) tailor-made policies for ensuring the sustainability of premium payments for each regional division. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"adult; article; government; hospital patient; household; human; Indonesia; informal sector; literacy; national health insurance; probability; worker; developing country; economics; female; Indonesia; insurance; male; middle aged; public health; Adult; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Informal Sector; Insurance; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Universal Health Insurance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073826437

A two period analytical model is developed to investigate the profitable buyback strategy for OEM and IR under low and high pricing strategy.

Under extensive game format, IR joins in the remanufacturing business to compete with OEM and based on OEM's attractive buyback strategy, IR adopts a profitable pricing strategy. The research addresses oligopoly market where OEM is not the single seller of new product and other sellers are interested in remanufacturing. In such scenario, OEM has less control over used products collection of other brand and OEM cannot restrict independent remanufacturer to venture within remanufacturing business.

To explore this we surveyed attendees of three AI conferences in 2018 about near-to-mid-term AI labor displacement as well as five more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Practitioners indicated that a median of 22% of tasks which humans are currently paid to do could be automated with existing AI; they anticipate this figure rising to 40% in 5 years and 60% in 10 years. Median forecasts indicated a 50% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90% of human tasks in 25 years and 99% of human tasks in 50 years. Practitioners surveyed at the different conferences had similar forecasts for AI labor displacement this decade, but attendees of the Human-level AI Conference had significantly shorter and more precise forecasts for the more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Interestingly, median forecasts of a 10% probability of 90% and 99% of human tasks being automated were 10 years and 15 years, respectively.

For the warranty with complimentary extended service, customers can enjoy a free extended warranty if they register online before expiration of the base warranty. At present, with frequent technological innovations, customers are more willing to replace the product instead of repair, which makes traditional warranty less attractive. Since the warranty with complimentary extended service does not charge extra fees for the customers and the option of online registration is open to customers, it can attract a broad range of customers. Compared with traditional warranties, the proposed warranty provides flexibility for customers in their post-purchase choice of online registration. We develop a warranty model to investigate the popularity of the warranty. It turns out that the proposed warranty model exhibits advantages over the traditional warranties. The proposed warranty is profitable for risk averse customers and for products that heap benefits from customer information. We design and price the warranty for unit product when the customers have heterogeneous risk attitudes. In addition, we analyze the total profit and determine the optimal selling price considering the customer demand.

A growing stream of research has examined how companies can incorporate “green” criteria into their supplier selection decisions. This research focuses on a specialized supplier selection decision: transportation carriers. Trucking companies in particular are under pressure to reduce their environmental footprint and improve working conditions for their drivers. As such, the purpose of this research is to explore how carriers' environmental and social sustainability performance influence shippers' selection decisions and trust perceptions. Two scenario-based experiments were conducted to understand whether shippers incorporate the environmental and social sustainability performance of carriers into the selection decision. The carrier selection decision was characterized by a long-term arrangement in study one and a short-term arrangement in study two, and both studies controlled for the economic dimension so that the distinct effects of the social and environmental dimensions could be isolated. The results find that environmental and social dimensions of sustainability play differential roles in short-term and long-term carrier selection decisions, with environmental dimensions playing a more significant role in long-term selection decisions and social dimensions playing a more significant role in short-term selection decisions. The findings offer a more nuanced theoretical understanding of sustainable carrier selection decisions and practical guidance for practitioners and policymakers. © 2020","Environmental sustainability; Experimental design; Green supplier selection; Green supply chain management; Social sustainability; Sustainable carrier selection","Design of experiments; Economic and social effects; Ships; Supply chain management; Trucks; Environmental sustainability; Green supplier selections; Green supply chain management; Social sustainability; Sustainable carrier selection; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079596818

Besides drawing on their legacy resources, pre-entrants during industry incubation commonly use alliances and acquisitions to obtain technical capabilities and complementary assets, thereby creating a portfolio of sourcing modes that collectively shapes the firms' paths to potential market entry. We identify a key pattern at the intersection of type of sourcing mode and type of resource: pre-entrants to the incubation stage are more likely to use alliances to source technical capabilities, while using acquisitions to source specialized complementary assets. Our empirical context is the agricultural biotechnology industry. Managerial summary: Firms typically seek new resources when they begin exploring potential industries, before any products have reached the market, yet the needed investments face substantial uncertainties. This article highlights a pattern in how firms use alliances and acquisitions for technical capabilities and complementary resources during the incubation stage of the agricultural biotechnology industry. We focus on two key features of the external sourcing activity, differing based on the type of resource: developing new core technologies, which often starts early, tends to leverage external alliance partners; by contrast, establishing complementary assets tends to start later through acquisitions. The logic underlying these patterns can help managers make effective decisions about their external sourcing strategies during the incubation stage of a new industry. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","capability reconfiguration; entry mode; industry incubation stage; nascent industries; pre-entry capabilities","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biotechnology; Commerce; Investments; Managers; Agricultural biotechnology; Complementary assets; Core technology; Potential industries; Potential markets; Sourcing modes; Sourcing strategies; Technical capabilities; Mergers and acquisitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084057334

Taken together, these results support the notion that flows of financial capital are most often positively correlated with financial performance. Managerial summary: A key question for any organization is how reallocating capital across business units is related to overall firm performance. We examine the correlations of firm profitability with a measure of change in year-to-year allocations across business units in a data set of several thousand firms spanning 18 years. Except in cases of the most extreme reallocations, our measure of firm reallocation is positively correlated with firm performance. Because we cannot prove causality, we cautiously conclude that our findings are consistent with a story that, in most cases, firms would benefit from greater internal reallocation of capital. The managerial question then becomes “what dynamic capabilities are necessary to increase the flow of resources across business segments?” Policies aimed at increasing allocation flow are likely to be beneficial. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","corporate finance; dynamic capabilities; inertia; internal capital markets; resource allocation","Managers; Profitability; Business segments; Business units; Dynamic capabilities; Financial capital; Financial performance; Firm Performance; Firm profitabilities; Inverted u shapes; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083695020

Using a unique data set of firmwide QC deficiencies identified by the PCAOB during its inspections of audit firms, I find a negative association between QC deficiencies, mainly performance related, and audit quality. Furthermore, audits conducted by larger audit firms with more organization-level deficiencies appear less profitable, evidenced by more hours worked on the engagements, leading to lower fees per hour. These results appear to be partly explained by deficiencies in the tone at the top (a proxy for culture) and the audit methodology. Further evidence suggests that a lack of remediation of QC system deficiencies has a negative influence on audit quality. © 2019 INFORMS","Audit efficiency; Audit methodology; Audit quality; Culture; Impact of regulation; PCAOB inspections; Quality control systems","Profitability; Audit firms; Data set; Economic consequences; Inspection programs; Public company; Inspection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090386304

An effective supply chain management provides a competitive advantage by reducing overhead costs and delays in product deliveries. To cope with internal and external risks, an integrated planning scheme can effectively adjust supply chain network operations and minimize negative effects of unexpected changes and failures. This paper proposes a risk-based optimization framework that handles supply chain's strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. A supply chain is considered as a network of suppliers, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and markets. The proposed model deals with uncertainties associated with demands, facility interruptions, lead times, and failures in supply, production, and distribution channels. To study more realistic supply chain operations, delays uncertainties are also included in the model. The structural design, communication between different centers, and inventory decisions are determined based on the risk perspective of the decision maker. To solve the proposed model, a new genetic algorithm is designed which is integrated with artificial neural network that learns from previous plans and search for better ones by minimizing any mismatch between supply and demand. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is investigated by comparing its results with those obtained from traditional techniques and regular GA. The results show that including adjustable tactical plans and incorporating learning mechanism considerably reduces inventory level and increases the profit level in supply chain systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic algorithm; Integrated supply chain; Neural network; Risk analysis; Robust network design","Competition; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Structural design; Supply chain management; Competitive advantage; Geographical locations; Integrated supply chain; New genetic algorithms; Optimization framework; Robust network; Supply chain operation; Traditional techniques; Risk analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076240175

The investigation in this research adopts a mix of a literature review, a questionnaire survey and a series of interviews. This research provides clear evidence for an increasing prevalence of proactive management in today’s construction practice.

The additive slacks-based network DEA can be solved using SOCP technique and adapted to the preference of the decision maker by choosing the weights for aggregating individual components in the network structures.

The promise of such solutions frequently underwrites claims for the public funding of research. In parallel, universities, public research organizations and, in particular, private enterprises draw on such research to actively secure property rights over potential applications through patenting. Patents represent a claim to garner financial returns from the novel outcomes of science and technology. This is justified by the potential social value promised by patents as they encourage information sharing, further R&D investment, and the useful application of new knowledge. Indeed, the value of patents has generated longstanding academic interest in innovation studies with many scholars investigating its determinants based on econometric models. Yet, this research has largely focused on evaluating factors that influence the market value of patents and the gains from exclusivity rights granted to inventions, which reflect the private value of a patent. However, the patent system is a socially shaped enterprise where private and public concerns intersect. Despite the notion of the social utility of inventions as a patenting condition, and evidence of disconnection between societal needs and the goals of private actors, less attention has been paid to other interpretations of patent value. This paper investigates the various articulations of value delineated by patents in an emerging science and technology domain. As a pilot study, we analyse patents in synthetic biology, contributing a new analytical framework and classification of private and public values at the intersections of science, economy, and society. After considering the legal, business, social and political dimensions of patenting, we undertake a qualitative and systematic examination of patent content in synthetic biology. Our analysis probes the private and public value propositions that are framed in these patents in terms of the potential private and public benefits of research and innovation. Based on this framework, we shed light on questions of what values are being nurtured in inventions in synthetic biology and discuss how attention to public as well as private values opens up promising avenues of research in science, technology and innovation policy. © 2019 The Authors","Patent documents; Patenting; Private value; Public value; Synthetic biology; Value mapping","Economics; Synthetic biology; Patent documents; Patenting; Political dimensions; Private value; Public funding of research; Public values; Science and Technology; Technology and Innovation Policy; Patents and inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074169744

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was used based on confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression analysis with a sample of 540 project members from 80 project management organizations in China. Findings: Research results showed that job satisfaction and positive affect of project members both have a significant positive impact on knowledge sharing; organizational commitment could moderate the influence of job satisfaction and positive affect on knowledge sharing among project members partially within the Chinese context. Research limitations/implications: A questionnaire study from China only represents the relationship and regular pattern within a shorter time interval in the Chinese context. It is necessary to continue to implement a longitudinal study in a relatively long period in future research. Practical implications: Knowledge sharing among project members can be enhanced through improving job satisfaction and positive affect, and strengthening project members’ organizational commitment can amplify the influence effect of job satisfaction and positive affect on knowledge sharing. Originality/value: This paper clarifies the direct influence mechanism of project members’ job satisfaction and positive affect on explicit knowledge sharing (EKS) and tacit knowledge sharing (TKS), and further tests the partial moderating effect of organizational commitment on the influence relationship of job satisfaction and positive affect on EKS and TKS. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Knowledge management; Organization; Questionnaire survey","Construction industry; Factor analysis; Job satisfaction; Project management; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Chinese construction industry; Confirmatory factor analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Hierarchical regression analysis; Influence relationships; Organizational Commitment; Project management organization; Questionnaire surveys; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071560461

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important technology to achieve a deep reduction of emissions in steel plants. Given by high cost and lack of policy incentive in deploying the CCS process, there has been a lack of progress in CCS within the steel sector in China. Capture readiness is a design concept to ease future CCS retrofit and avoid the carbon lock-in effect in steel plants. Capture Readiness design requires moderate upfront investment, i.e. less than 0.5% additional capital expenditure, but could easily enable the plant to be retrofitted with CCS technologies in their lifetime. The paper develops a novel linear programming model to assess the economic cost of Capture Readiness design in a generic steel plant in China. The Baowu Steel Zhanjiang project was used as a reference plant to develop the generic steel plant for the model. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, the results show that the economic cost of making new steel plants in capture readiness for 0.5 million tonnes capture is CNY 65 million (USD 9.5 million) in a conservative 5% carbon price growth rate scenario. The paper found the value of flexibility brought by capture readiness design is significant and is equal to approximately 15% of initial capital investment. The economically viable chance of retrofitting steel plants with CCS technologies in the lifetime is 49%. In an uncertainty analysis, for a 6% growth rate of carbon price, the option value could be increased to CNY 145 million while the probability of retrofit increases to 79%. China's CCS policy should consider a requirement for newly built steel plants to adopt capture readiness design to capture the significant economic value and ease emissions reduction in the iron and steel sector in the long term. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capture readiness; CCS; China; Real option; Steel","Costs; Economics; Emission control; Growth rate; Intelligent systems; Investments; Linear programming; Monte Carlo methods; Retrofitting; Steel; Steelmaking; Uncertainty analysis; Capital expenditures; Capture readiness; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); China; Economically viable; Emissions reduction; Linear programming models; Real Options; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074441249

The firm needs to price these products to sell them to its customer base. Products are described by vectors of features and the market value of each product is linear in the values of the features. The firm does not initially know the values of the different features, but can learn the values of the features based on whether products were sold at the posted prices in the past. This model is motivated by applications such as online marketplaces, online flash sales, and loan pricing. We first consider a multidimensional version of binary search over polyhedral sets and show that it has a worst-case regret which is exponential in the dimension of the feature space. We then propose a modification of the prior algorithm where uncertainty sets are replaced by their Löwner-John ellipsoids. We show that this algorithm has a worst-case regret which is quadratic in the dimension of the feature space and logarithmic in the time horizon. We also show how to adapt our algorithm to the case where valuations are noisy. Finally, we present computational experiments to illustrate the performance of our algorithm.

Our forecasting model draws on “procedural” variables, building on insights from the contentious politics literature. We show that a procedural model outperforms more inductive, atheoretical alternatives and also outperforms models based on countries’ structural characteristics, which previously dominated models of civil war onset.

A quantitative methodology and non-experimental design were accomplished using 510 participants to develop the regression equation and assess model fit. Six significant predictors of consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis were found: familiarity, value, fun factor, wariness of new technology, fear and happiness. Three additional analyses were assessed using an independent sample of participants, revealing strong model fit. Few previous studies have provided a quantitative assessment of which factors significantly predict consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying six significant factors which account for over 76% of the variance.

However, other more traditional, labor-intensive industries are lagging behind. We use granular data to examine the impact of a customer-facing technology (a tabletop device that facilitates the table service process) on the check size and meal duration aspects of restaurant performance. The restaurant chain in our study implemented tabletop devices in a staggered manner, offering us a quasi-experimental setting in which to apply a difference-in-difference technique and identify the causal effect of the technology. We find that the tabletop technology is likely to improve average sales per check by approximately 1% (95% confidence interval is from 0.8% to 1.02%), and reduce the meal duration by close to 10% (95% confidence interval ranges from -9.94% to -9.54%). The combination of these two effects increases the sales per minute or sales productivity by approximately 11%. Various robustness checks of our empirical strategy and post hoc analyses find that tabletop technology allows low-ability waiters to improve their performance more significantly than high-ability waiters. In addition, the technology does not change the staffing level. Overall, our results indicate great potential for introducing tabletop technology in a large service industry that currently lacks digitalization.

Our study is thus motivated to examine how the emphasis of the text narratives affect the fundraising outcomes. We propose an improved deep learning model for text content emphasis (TCE) detection from various textual sources, including titles, blurbs, and detailed descriptions, and then estimate the impact of TCE on the success of fundraising campaigns. With data collected from public sources of Kickstarter platform, our empirical analyses demonstrate that TCE matters differently for various textual sources. It is more effective for the title and blurb to emphasize the entrepreneur profile, while the detailed description should highlight the idea creativity. Furthermore, for the detailed description, the entrepreneur profile has a more positive effect when it is placed at the beginning of the narrative. And the effects of entrepreneur-oriented narratives are more pronounced in these projects with more social connections.

The global climate crisis has put pressure on and increased firm sensitivity to environmental issues. Predicting corporate environmental performance can help plan for environmental impact mitigation by adjusting organizational practices. Lack of environment-related information makes it difficult to make such predictions. This paper tends to provide useful insights into corporate environmental performance among firms to facilitate better environmental management for both government and firms. A theoretical framework informed by the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm and institutional theory is used to identify variables for predicting corporate environmental performance. Five dimensions including institutional context, governance capability, information management capability, system capability, and technology-related capability, populated with 14 variables are used to empirically investigate the relationship of these variables with corporate environmental performance. Using 1100 data points on energy service companies (ESCOs) from 2011 to 2015 in mainland China, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, a statistical nonlinear machine learning approach, is utilized to predict corporate environmental performance. The results demonstrate that the XGBoost model can be effective for ESCO environmental performance prediction, with satisfactory prediction accuracy. This study also adopted the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for model interpretation, indicating that total assets, amount of proactive environmental costs, proportion of technicians and number of patents contribute most to corporate environmental performance. Several policies and environmental strategies for improving corporate environmental performance in the ESCO industry are derived from this analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate environmental performance; Energy service company (ESCO); Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)","Adaptive boosting; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Information management; Machine learning; Corporate environmental performance; Energy service companies (ESCos); Energy service company; Environmental performance; Institutional contexts; Machine learning approaches; Organizational practices; Satisfactory predictions; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085643425

Unlike other fields that have improved upon the lack of diversity, construction remains one of the most male-dominated fields in the United States. The ever increasing demand for workers is breaking down the unique barriers that women have faced. Though these barriers still exist, efforts to attract and retain women in the construction industry are improving. This study aims to investigate the factors that are most influential in attracting women to and retaining them in management careers in the construction industry. A funded research study with ELECTRI International provided support to identify the attraction and retention factors for women working in management positions in the electrical construction industry. A web-based survey was distributed throughout the nation and collected the perceptions and experiences of managerial-level workers in the electrical industry. In total, 686 managers responded to the survey, 71 of whom were women.

Closing a store may reduce a retailer's costs, while opening a new store may increase revenue. Thus, it is far from obvious which action yields the maximum profit. Furthermore, retailers need to align these store-by-store tactical decisions with their overall distribution strategies to achieve a superior performance. Using a sample of 157 public retailers from 1999 to 2015, this study examines how store closings and openings are associated with retailer profitability. To complement extant research, we construct a parsimonious measure that captures a retailer's store management decision, namely, net store closings (NSC). Drawing on the contingency theory of organizations, we develop a comprehensive framework that studies the moderating roles of retailer competencies, retailer resources, and retail environment. Through panel fixed effects estimation, we identify ten contingent factors that significantly moderate the relationship between NSC and profit. Specifically, e-tail experience, total experience, receivables intensity, retailer innovativeness, industry e-tail prevalence, and industry concentration positively moderate the association between NSC and subsequent profitability, while inventory turnover, sales force intensity, capital intensity, and firm size negatively moderate this association. In addition, we explore how individual measures (i.e., store closings and store openings) are associated with retailer profitability and find consistent results. Anecdotal and statistical evidence indicates that NSC is a sufficient measure of store management actions. The study has important implications for how retailers should manage their channel distribution strategies and resource allocation decisions. © 2020 New York University","Net store closings; Profitability; Retail environment; Retailer competencies; Retailer resources; Store management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077929065

In this paper, using data from Ghana, we employ propensity score matching to control for selection bias and to analyse adoption of adaptation technologies, its determinants as well as impact on cocoa productivity and incomes. The results showed that most cocoa farmers do not adopt climate change adaptation technologies and for those who adopt some technologies, diversification of income sources was the major innovation. Also, eight factors including gender, age of respondent, involvement in other economic activities, farm size, membership of a farmer association, access to extension service, access to credit as well as annual income from cocoa production were found to significantly influence adoption of climate change adaptation technologies.

Additionally, a decision maker's risk attitude is of particular importance in decision-making. To simultaneously consider these two important factors, this paper proposes a new ER approach. In the approach, with the consideration of a decision maker's risk attitude, the combinational reliability of each criterion for each alternative is constructed from the original reliability of the criterion. By following the regression idea to learn the original reliability of each criterion, a unified optimization model is constructed, in which the maximum difference between combinational reliabilities and their estimations is minimized. Within the post-optimal solution space of criterion reliabilities found by solving the unified model, another optimization model is constructed, from which the minimum and maximum expected utilities of each alternative are determined. Solutions to multi-criteria decision-making problems are then generated from the expected utilities. The proposed approach is used to analyze a material supplier selection problem for a company located in Tongling, Anhui, China. The analysis of the problem demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2020","Criterion reliability; Evidential reasoning approach; Evidential reasoning rule; Multiple criteria decision making; Risk attitude","Optimization; Reliability; Evidential reasoning approaches; Expected utility; Material suppliers; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Optimal solutions; Optimization modeling; Unified Modeling; Unified optimizations; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084187437

Through its benefits, it offers income, life and property protection to the insured and their keens, as well as income accumulation that can be used at retirement to help preserve the desired lifestyle or living standards. Motivated by this end of insurance, the goal of this paper is to study the contribution of insurance growth to economic growth, by employing the benefit side of the insurance activity, next to the acquisition side that has already been considered. More precisely, the findings provide evidence that gross claims payments and gross operating expenses are significantly and positively related to economic growth. At the same time, the results confirm the findings of the existing literature that gross premia and insurance penetration are also significantly and positively related to economic growth. The outcomes hold true for total, life and non-life insurance, both during the pre- and post- 2008-crisis periods, even though less strong after the crisis. Furthermore, the positive and statistically significant impact of gross capital formation, government expenditure, secondary schooling, FDI inflows, trade openness and financial development is validated, in line with certain theoretical expectations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Economic growth; Insurance growth; Macroeconomic variables; Premium; Retention",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084550744

We argue that in making entry decisions, firms take into account how an entry into a new location helps increase the operational flexibility of their affiliate portfolios due to options to switch operations across affiliates in case of diverging labor cost developments across host countries. We juxtapose this real options-based explanation with a risk diversification explanation. Analysis of Japanese multinational firms' foreign entry decisions suggests that the two explanations are complementary. We also establish portfolio-level boundary conditions to the influence of operational flexibility considerations on entry, in the form of product diversification and the nature of dispersion of labor cost levels. Managerial Summary: When deciding on whether to enter a foreign market, managers of a multinational firm are intuitively aware that they need to consider how the economic environment of the target host country is related to the environments of the existing countries in which the firm operates. The less the environments are correlated with each other, whether in terms of input cost or market demand conditions, the greater the chance that the firm may capture cost savings and reduce sales volatility globally. These benefits arise from a switching option to shift operations flexibly across countries and from an ability to reduce risk by holding a portfolio of diversified global investments. Our findings support both sets of considerations, suggesting that companies do give due attention to correlations in labor cost and market demand between the target host country to enter and the existing host countries. © 2020 The Authors.

App users typically have a poor understanding of information security; worse, they routinely ignore security notifications designed to increase security on apps. By considering both mobile app interface usability and mobile security notification (MSN) design, we investigate how security perceptions of apps are formed and how these perceptions influence users’ intentions to continue using apps. Accordingly, we designed and conducted a set of controlled survey experiments with 317 participants in different MSN interface scenarios by manipulating the types of MSN interfaces (i.e., high vs. low disruption), the context (hedonic vs. utilitarian scenarios), and the degree of MSN intrusiveness (high vs. low intrusiveness). We found that both app interface usability and the design of MSNs significantly impacted users’ perceived security, which, in turn, has a positive influence on users’ intention to continue using the app. In addition, we identified an important conundrum: disruptive MSNs—a common approach to delivering MSNs—irritate users and negatively influence their perceptions of app security. Thus, our results directly challenge current practice. If these results hold, current practice should shift away from MSNs that interrupt task performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dual-task interference; Human–computer interaction (HCI); Mobile applications (apps); Mobile device; Mobile security; Mobile security notification (MSN); Perceived security","Human computer interaction; Mobile computing; Mobile computing; Security of data; Surveys; Computer interaction; Current practices; Dual-task interference; Interface usability; Mobile applications; Perceived securities; Security and privacy issues; Task performance; Mobile security",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076236511

The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical development of crisis communication in the internal context of an organization, especially with respect to employee voice behaviours.

Contrary to the classical CVRP, which assumes that the customer demands are deterministic, we model the demands as a random vector whose distribution is only known to belong to an ambiguity set. We then require the delivery schedule to be feasible with a probability of at least 1 - ∈, where ∈ characterizes the risk tolerance of the decision maker. We argue that the emerging distributionally robust CVRP can be solved efficiently with standard branch-and-cut algorithms whenever the ambiguity set satisfies a subadditivity condition. We then show that this subadditivity condition holds for a large class of moment ambiguity sets. We derive efficient cut generation schemes for ambiguity sets that specify the support as well as (bounds on) the first and second moments of the customer demands. Our numerical results indicate that the distributionally robust CVRP has favorable scaling properties and can often be solved in runtimes comparable to those of the deterministic CVRP. © 2020 INFORMS.","Chance constraints; Distributionally robust optimization; Vehicle routing","Decision making; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Sales; Vehicles; Branch-and-cut algorithms; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Chance-constrained; Customer demands; Delivery schedules; Numerical results; Scaling properties; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091677658

Since then, agencies generally rely on universal metrics such as licensing income and number of patents to measure the benefit of their technology transfer program. However, such metrics do not address the requirements set by the current and previous administrations, which require agencies to better gauge the effectiveness and return on investment of their technology programs. Here we evaluate two metrics, filing ratio and transfer rate, and empirically evaluate these metrics using data from Department of the Navy’s most transactionally active laboratory, as well as recently released agency-reported data available from the FY 2015 annual technology transfer report (15 U.S.C.

We conducted seven experiments to investigate the impact of two types of priming (numeric priming and semantic priming) delivered through what appeared to be advertisements on an e-commerce website. We found that numeric priming had a small but significant effect on consumers’ willingness to pay when the value of the product was unclear, but had no effect when products displayed a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) or a fixed selling price. Semantic priming had larger effects on willingness to pay and the effects were significant but smaller in the presence of an MSRP. Thus, the combination of numeric and semantic priming has a larger impact on consumers’ willingness to pay. Taken together, these experiments show that some of the research on numeric priming and semantic priming done in offline settings generalizes to e-commerce settings, but there are important boundary conditions to their effects in e-commerce that have not been noted in offline settings. In online auctions (e.g., eBay), sellers can influence customers to pay more for products whose value is unclear by displaying products with clearly labelled high prices alongside the products the consumer searched for. However, such tactics will have only minimal effects for auctions of products whose price is known (e.g., those with an MSRP) and no effects on products with clearly listed prices (e.g., Amazon). © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","anchoring and adjustment; Decision making; digital nudge; dual process cognition; online auctions; price anchors; pricing; priming; System 1 cognition; System 2 cognition; willingness to pay","Behavioral research; Costs; Decision making; Sales; Semantics; anchoring and adjustment; digital nudge; Dual process; Online auctions; priming; System 1 cognition; System 2 cognition; Willingness to pay; Electronic commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081030160

Our results are suggestive of heterogeneous effects of CG mechanisms on firm value and profitability in that they might have either encouraged or discouraged FV in Saudi Arabia.

Our findings indicate that implementing a voluntary 'comply-or-explain' CG regime in Saudi Arabia has, so far, a limited impact on FV. This implies that developing other enforcement mechanisms for CG provisions, such as appending good CG practices to listing rules for companies to comply with, might lead to better financial results for those well-governed companies in Saudi Arabia.

Limited land and growing water scarcity mean that establishing systems to maximise the benefits from every drop is pivotal. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a canal irrigation project for smallholders in the Philippines, focusing on rice, one of the world's most water intensive crops. We contribute to two strands of literature by combining impact evaluation and efficiency analysis methods. Using a dataset for 714 treatment and 440 control farm parcels, we apply Propensity Score Matching and a selectivity-corrected Stochastic Production Frontier to handle biases from both observable and unobservable variables. We then analyse technical efficiency (TE) and frontier output using a shared Stochastic Meta-Frontier. We find that the project had a statistically significant impact on frontier output but not on TE, suggesting that improved irrigation technology increased beneficiaries' production potential, but it did not improve TE likely due to insufficient training and input access. Thus, beneficiaries were unable to take full advantage of their improved production potential, highlighting the need for suitable complementary support in future projects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main beneficiaries were downstream parcels, smaller parcels, those located in the poorer project district, and farmers with lower education, all implying a pro-poor impact. Finally, we find that female-headed households benefitted less from the project, suggesting the need for additional support in future interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Impact evaluation; Irrigation; Philippines; Productivity; Rice; Selectivity bias; Stochastic Production and Meta-Frontiers","agricultural production; farming system; infrastructural development; irrigation; livelihood; meta-analysis; smallholder; stochasticity; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088375753

The barges depart from the dry port and visit a set of sea terminals, where containers need either to be dropped off or picked up. The goal is to achieve economies of scale with barges and avoid trucking as much as possible. The decision thus involves finding the best allocation of containers to barges in order to guarantee on-time delivery and meet capacity restrictions. The problem will be modeled as a variant of the split vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries coupled with time features. The model includes parameters that can be tuned to improve barge utilization and travelling distance. A hybrid local search meta-heuristic algorithm, combined with a branch-and-cut solver, will be developed to solve the model. Numerical experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm and provide solution analysis for practical insights. Real-world data has been collected from a local barge operator based in the Port of Rotterdam region and will be used as input for the experiments. This will result in an in-depth analysis into current planning practices.

In this paper, we introduce an extended version of the VRPSD, called the Vehicle Routing Problem with Shipment Consolidation (VRPC), a model that considers not only split deliveries, but also shipment exchanges (transfers) between different vehicles at certain customer locations (a process referred to as mid-route shipment consolidation). We conduct a series of numerical experiments, as well as a case study, to show that VRPC solutions match or outperform those of the VRPSD. Results indicate that up to 10 percent savings may be attained through the VRPC in lieu of the VRPSD, which implies that the efficiency of last-mile delivery may be improved by allowing mid-route shipment consolidation at select customer locations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Logistics; Metaheuristics; Optimization; Vehicle routing problem","Efficiency; Logistics; Optimization; Sales; Ships; Cost saving; Decision modeling; Extended versions; Last mile; Meta heuristics; Numerical experiments; Split delivery; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078969123

But, while studies on social media are popping up like kettle corn across disciplines, no conceptual framework for organizing, guiding, and inspiring research on social media engagement among strategic leaders has yet appeared. Toward this end, we first clarify the construct and develop a typological conceptualization of strategic leaders' social media engagement behaviors. Next, we introduce a theoretical framework and corresponding propositions for explaining the variations, mechanisms, and consequences of social media engagements. We conclude with implications for future research, including data collection and measurement. Managerial summary: With the growing proliferation of social media platforms, today's executives are faced with a vast array of choices about how to use social media to engage with diverse stakeholders and online communities. Although avoidance continues to be a preference for many executives, the scale and scope of social media platforms offer executives unprecedented opportunities—as well as risks—to engage stakeholders. We develop and illustrate a framework of six archetypal engagement behaviors through which executives may leverage social media to reach, communicate, and interact with stakeholders in developing and executing strategy—for both good and ill.

This research developed a web application which serves as a decision support system for those involved in the planning and management of municipal solid waste. In contrast to present web-based solutions, this tool provides the necessary information regarding the supply chain that is required to assess the suitability of waste valorisation in a particular location such as waste types, waste quantities and related waste contractors. Using publicly available data, a web geographic information system was designed where factors that affect the supply chain of municipal solid waste can be investigated. These include spatial and temporal variation of waste generated. The concept was demonstrated in the developed web application using publicly available data about England. Waste market opportunities were identified, for example Kent County Council and Essex County Council were identified to have the highest quantity of incinerated waste with and without energy recovery (344 and 65 kiloton) respectively. Then Staffordshire and Lancashire County Councils were identified to have the highest quantity of hazardous and non-hazardous waste being landfilled (5 and 296 kiloton) respectively. Seasonal variation was inconsistent across counties, with East Northamptonshire having little seasonal variation in household waste (<500 tonne variation) as opposed to East Riding of Yorkshire which had higher waste volumes in summer with up to 15,000 tonne variation). Circular economy partners were also identified through the web application and these results are presented in context of waste-derived supply chain decisions. The web application is therefore able to provide a comprehensive tool for improving both strategic and logistical decision-making process for municipal solid waste management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Decision support tool; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste management; Web-GIS","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Hazards; Supply chains; Waste management; Websites; Circular economy; Decision making process; Decision support tools; Market opportunities; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Spatial and temporal variation; Web geographic information system; Web-GIS; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083002268

Robust and coherent reconstruction planning and rapid execution play pivotal roles in ameliorating time-consuming postdisaster recovery. Reconstruction generally constitutes a considerable portion of an entire disaster recovery process that requires significant resources, including materials, workforce, funding, time, and others. To pursue maximum socioeconomic benefits, which can be one of the critical goals of the postdisaster recovery process, optimized recovery strategies should be designed by considering given federal, state, and local resources. Even though recent studies have proposed disaster recovery planning and execution models, they rarely addressed social and economic indicators required for comprehensive postdisaster recovery plans. This paper presents a new postdisaster recovery prioritization model, including social and economic factors, that evaluates priorities of damaged facilities recovery projects in affected regions through a resource allocation analysis. The primary goal of the proposed model is to optimize resource allocation and quantify and maximize socioeconomic benefits for a postdisaster reconstruction project portfolio through multicriteria decision analysis and multiobjective optimization. Also, this research study adopts a modular construction technique as a potential solution for facilitating the recovery processes, which can significantly reduce their time and cost. The proposed model is expected to provide a comprehensive decision-making process for researchers and practitioners to design a postdisaster recovery plan and arrange their available resources by considering the socioeconomic factors of affected communities. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Modular construction; Multicriteria decision analysis; Optimization; Postdisaster recovery; Socioeconomic benefits","Decision making; Decision theory; Disasters; Economics; Modular construction; Multiobjective optimization; Recovery; Resource allocation; Construction technique; Damaged infrastructure; Decision making process; Disaster recovery planning; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Post-disaster reconstruction; Socio-economic benefits; Socio-economic factor; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084640531

In the context of a worsening environment, the Chinese government has realized the disadvantages of extensive development and has launched a full range of actions for energy-intensive and heavy-polluting industrial sectors, which are called “low-hanging fruits.” However, this principle has challenges, such as bottlenecks in emissions reduction and development restrictions in certain sectors. To solve these problems, this paper divides 37 industries into heavy-, middle-, and low-polluting industrial sectors according to a pollution intensive index. Subsequently, three types of environmental regulation measurements (mandatory control environmental regulation, market incentive environmental regulation, and voluntary compliance environmental regulation) are applied to verify the heterogeneous effects of environmental regulations on the green total factor productivity. In this study, super-epsilon-based measure model and global Malmquist-Luenberger index are used to calculate the green total factor productivity of these industries. Thus, a better understanding of environmental regulations in regards to polluting industrial sectors is provided. The results show that different types of environmental regulations exhibit heterogeneous effects on the green total factor productivities of different polluting industrial sectors. The relationship between the mandatory control environmental regulation/market incentive environmental regulation and the green total factor productivity for heavy-polluting industries is shown to be an inverse U shape that crosses an inflection point, indicating that the environmental regulation intensity of heavy-polluting industry is sufficient, perhaps even excessive. Notably, the relationship between the three environmental regulations and the middle-polluting industries all present a U shape, and the environmental regulation intensities are far away from the inflection point. In that regard, excessive regulation may lead to high operating costs and may burden low-polluting industrial sectors. In such cases, strengthening the environmental regulations for middle-polluting industries should be an efficient and reasonable way to achieve a win-win direction for both environmental protection and economic development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental regulation; Green total factor productivity; Pollution intensive industrial sectors; Super-EBM","Compliance control; Emission control; Fruits; Operating costs; Productivity; Telecommunication industry; Chinese Government; Emissions reduction; Heterogeneous effects; Industrial sector; Inflection points; Malmquist-Luenberger indices; Super-EBM; Total factor productivity; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079863258

To facilitate our investigation, we focus on both the process and outcome of phishing detection. Survey data from college students confirms that one's susceptibility is affected by detection process difficulty and detection outcome failures in the recent phishing encounter. Results also reveal the importance of personal attributes, such as past success in phishing detection and phishing desensitization, in regulating the effects of a recent phishing encounter. Finally, results show the relationship between detection process difficulty and outcome failures, in addition to confirming antecedents to the two detection components.

To ensure the long-term sustainability of these newly established systems it is essential to carefully monitor the economic impact. Based on the panel data of 21 developing countries from 2000 to 2016, this paper is the first to apply the panel threshold model to empirically analyze the relationship between national health expenditures and economic growth under different levels of human capital. The results show that health expenditure and economic growth have significant interval effects because of the different levels of human capital. Specifically, when human capital levels are low, health expenditure is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth. When human capital is at a medium level, health expenditure has a positive but not significant impact on economic growth. When the level of human capital is high, the positive economic impact of the health expenditure is significantly enhanced. In addition, subgroup analyses indicate that population aging and low fertility aggravate the negative impact of health expenditures on economic growth.

The main task of the paper is to attribute an employment status to individuals that did not fully report entrepreneur status in earlier censuses (1851–1881). The paper assesses the accuracy of different classifiers and machine learning algorithms, including Deep Learning, for this classification problem. We first adopt a ground-truth dataset from the later censuses to train the computer with a Logistic Regression (which is standard in the literature for this kind of binary classification) to recognize entrepreneurs distinct from non-entrepreneurs (i.e. workers). Our initial accuracy for this base-line method is 0.74. We compare the Logistic Regression with ten optimized machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors, Linear and Radial Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. The best results are boosting and ensemble methods. AdaBoost achieves an accuracy of 0.95. Deep-Learning, as a standalone category of algorithms, further improves accuracy to 0.96 without using the rich text-data that characterizes the OccString feature, a string of up to 500 characters with the full occupational statement of each individual collected in the earlier censuses. Finally, and now using this OccString feature, we implement both shallow (bag-of-words algorithm) learning and Deep Learning (Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory layer) algorithms. These methods all achieve accuracies above 0.99 with Deep Learning Recurrent Neural Network as the best model with an accuracy of 0.9978. The results show that standard algorithms for classification can be outperformed by machine learning algorithms. This confirms the value of extending the techniques traditionally used in the literature for this type of classification problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Census; Classification; Deep learning; Logistic regression; Machine learning","Adaptive boosting; Big data; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep learning; Discriminant analysis; Large dataset; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Population statistics; Recurrent neural networks; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Surveys; Binary classification; Census; Ground-truth dataset; Historical census datum; Logistic regressions; Machine learning classification; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Standard algorithms; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078698075

We start by explaining how profiling, in an increasingly data-rich environment, creates substantial power asymmetries between users and platforms (and corporations more broadly). Inferences and the increasingly automated nature of decision-making, both based on user data, are essential aspects of profiling. We then connect chilling effects theory and the relevant empirical findings to corporate profiling. In this article, we first stress the relationship and similarities between profiling and surveillance. Second, we describe chilling effects as a result of state and peer surveillance, specifically. We then show the interrelatedness of corporate and state profiling, and finally spotlight the customization of behavior and behavioral manipulation as particularly significant issues in this discourse. This is complemented with an exploration of the legal foundations of profiling through an analysis of European and US data protection law. We find that while Europe has a clear regulatory framework in place for profiling, the US primarily relies on a patchwork of sector-specific or state laws. Further, there is an attempt to regulate differential impacts of profiling via anti-discrimination statutes, yet few policies focus on combating generalized harms of profiling, such as chilling effects. Finally, we devise four concise propositions to guide future research on the connection between corporate profiling and chilling effects. © 2019 Eduard Fosch Villaronga","Algorithms; Big data; Chilling effects; Data protection; Digital footprints; Inferences; Privacy; Profiling; Surveillance","Algorithms; Big data; Data privacy; Decision making; Monitoring; Space surveillance; Algorithmic Profiling; Digital footprints; Empirical findings; Inferences; Profiling; Regulatory frameworks; State laws; User data; Laws and legislation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076551586

One such application is viral marketing to trigger a large cascade of product adoption from a small number of users by utilizing “Word-of-Mouth” effect in social networks. IM aims to return a set of users that can influence the largest fraction of a network, such as the early user who demonstrates the good features of a product in marketing. The traditional IM algorithms treat all users equally and ignore semantic context associated with the users, though it has been studied previously. To consider the semantics, we introduce a semantics-aware influence maximization (SIM) problem. The SIM problem integrates semantic information of users with influence maximization by measuring influence spread based on semantic values under a given model, and it aims to find a set of users that maximizes the influence spread, shown to be NP-hard. Generalized Reverse Influence Set based framework for SIM problems (GRIS-SIM) is used to solve SIM with different semantics, which provides a (1−1/e−ε)-approximation solution for each SIM instance. To our knowledge, the guarantee is state-of-the-art in the IM studies. GRIS-SIM enables auto-generation of sampling strategies for various social networks. In this study, we also present three sampling strategies that can be generated to achieve the best approximation guarantee, and one of the three is proved to be the optimal strategy by having the same performance guarantee within the optimal time. Furthermore, in order to show the generality and effectiveness of the proposed GRIS technique, we apply it into solving other IM problems (e.g., the distance-aware influence maximization, DAIM). Extensive experiments on both real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our methods. The results on large real data show that GRIS-SIM is able to achieve 58% improvement on average in expected influence compared with rivals, and the method adopting GRIS can achieve 65% improvement on average. © 2019","Influence maximization; Influence measurement; Social network analysis; User semantics","Commerce; Marketing; Optimization; Semantic Web; Semantics; Social networking (online); Approximation solution; Best approximations; Influence maximizations; Network applications; Performance guarantees; Sampling strategies; Semantic information; Synthetic datasets; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075504484

However, little is known about the economic effects of firm reactions to these events. This study fills this gap and estimates how announcements of firms' reactions (yes versus no), timing (slow versus fast), and type (maintain/suspend versus no reaction) affect daily abnormal stock returns (ARs) following negative publicity. Using 128 events of negative endorser publicity between 1988 and 2016 affecting firms in 230 cases, this study offers new and economically relevant insights. The most surprising finding is that firms can gain value depending on their response. Announcements of firms' reactions positively affect ARs, especially if they occur quickly after negative publicity surfaces. The analyses reveal that fast (slow) announcements of firms' reactions increase (decrease) firm value by 2.10% (-1.88%) over the next four trading weeks. Results also show that issuing statements suspending or maintaining the endorser both yield more positive ARs than not reacting at all. Further analyses identify conditions under which the stock market rewards maintaining or suspending an endorser.

Before VBP's launch, some practitioners claimed VBP would have little impact, while others feared well-off hospitals would be unfairly rewarded at the expense of previously poor-performing hospitals. We examine whether and how the VBP penalties affect aggregate operating outcomes of healthcare providers in hospitals. Using secondary data, we find empirical evidence that hospitals with prior-year VBP penalties exhibit positive associations between the penalty magnitude and certain current-year care process improvements. Over the prior year, penalized hospitals also tend to exhibit increased patient case mix metrics, which should enhance revenue as a spillover effect. In a post hoc analysis, we observe that bonus-receiving hospitals are less apt to exhibit subsequent performance improvements for these same metrics. Our contributions result from theoretically framing differences in hospital operating activities when facing the VBP Program's penalties as well as empirically demonstrating consequences of the penalty's magnitude. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","empirical; healthcare policy; hospital; service operations; value-based purchasing program","Health care; Health insurance; Sales; Econometric analysis; empirical; Federal regulations; Health care providers; Hospital operations; Improve performance; Service operations; Value-based; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073799478

We analyze this problem under the framework of competitive analysis, where the sequence of customers is unknown and does not necessarily follow any pattern. Previous work in this area, studying online matching, advertising, and assortment problems, has focused on the case where each item can only be sold at a single price, resulting in algorithms which achieve the best-possible competitive ratio of 1−1/e. In this paper, we extend all of these results to allow for items having multiple feasible prices. Our algorithms achieve the best-possible weight-dependent competitive ratios, which depend on the sets of feasible prices given in advance. Our algorithms are also simple and intuitive; they are based on constructing a class of universal value functions that integrate the selection of items and prices offered. Finally, we test our algorithms on the publicly available hotel data set of Bodea et al. [Bodea T, Ferguson M, Garrow L (2009) Data set-Choice-based revenue management: Data from a major hotel chain. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 11(2):356-361.], where there are multiple items (hotel rooms), each with multiple prices (fares at which the room could be sold). We find that applying our algorithms, as a hybrid with algorithms that attempt to forecast and learn the future transactions, results in the best performance.

The German government uses a feed-in-tariff policy that provides a guaranteed stream of payments for each unit of electricity generated by a household. In contrast, the U.S. government uses a tax-rebate policy that reduces the initial investment cost, and the household receives the retail price for the generated electricity. In this paper, we study the key practical factors that favor one policy over the other from the perspective of the government. These factors are the heterogeneity in the generating efficiency, the variability in the electricity price, and the variability in the investment cost. Academic relevance: Unlike the previous literature on the feed-in-tariff and tax-rebate policies, we focus on the effects of variability on a household's investment timing. We identify the optimal policy for the government to manage the aggregate household investment, accounting for the heterogeneity in efficiency. Methodology: We consider an infinite-horizon, continuous-time model where the government moves first and announces either a feed-in tariff or a tax rebate. Then each household dynamically decides if and when to invest in a unit of solar panels. The objective of the government is to maximize the expected value of a subsidy policy, that is, the difference between the societal benefit of solar panel investments and the subsidy cost over time. Results: We characterize the timing of the investment decision of the households and the optimal subsidy parameters for the government. We identify which practical factors favor the feed-in-tariff or the tax-rebate policy. Policy implications: Our results suggest that a government should prefer the feed-in-tariff policy when the electricity price is highly uncertain. Intuitively, feed-in-tariff policy eliminates the price variability; thus, it removes the strategic delay in the investment. The tax-rebate policy should be adopted if the households are heterogeneous in generating efficiency, if the investment cost is highly variable, or if the price and cost uncertainty are positively correlated.

However, due to the misuse of LSS theory in practice, a high rate of implementation failure results. There is a need for a structured and standardised framework to describe how the LSS initiative should be implemented and sustained over time. As a result, this study aims to develop a practical, user-friendly and accurate LSS road map for a Scottish manufacturing small and medium enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to analyse existing literature on lean and Six Sigma that included road maps and critical success factors (CSFs) in order to design an in-company, quantitative survey instrument. The aim of the survey was to evaluate employees' perceptions on the importance of LSS CSFs for the successful implementation and sustainability of a continuous improvement initiative. Based on the literature and results from the data collected, an LSS reference guide - in the form of a road map - was designed to support LSS implementation and sustainability. Findings: A customised LSS reference guide in a road map format for the Scottish SME was proposed. This road map was developed by adopting existing successful road maps from the literature into consideration and then adapting them to fulfil the company's particular perspective on CI. This study complements current literature on LSS road maps and corroborates LSS CSFs as crucial for successful LSS implementation and sustainability, regardless of the type of company and/or culture. However, a degree of importance is ascribed to the organisation's culture. Research limitations/implications: Whilst a survey was used as the data collection instrument future interviews with employees would enhance the understanding of the organisational culture and hence further improve the road map. Originality/value: The authors developed a practical and strategic roadmap for a Scottish packaging small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) which can be used by other similar SMEs. The proposed LSS road map can be replicated and/or adapted for companies in their application of LSS. The methodology by which this study's road map was designed can be used as a guide in the development of further CI road maps. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuous improvement; Critical success factors; Lean Six Sigma; Roadmap; SMEs; Sustainable implementation","Competition; Enterprise resource planning; Lean production; Personnel; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Silicon; Six sigma; Sustainable development; Work simplification; Competitive advantage; Continuous improvements; Critical success factor; Design/methodology/approach; Organisational culture; Small and medium enterprise; Small- and medium-sized enterprise; Survey instruments; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084453201

This gap limits our understanding of whether and how formal R&D structure can be used as a lever to influence research outcomes. To address this question, we study the relationship between formal R&D structure, internal inventor networks, and innovative behavior and outcomes. We find that centralization of R&D budget authority increases the connectedness of internal inventor networks, which in turn increases the breadth of both innovation impact and technological search. Surprisingly, decentralization does not have the opposite effect. Our results suggest that changes in formal structure influence innovation outcomes through changes in inventor networks, with a lag reflecting organizational inertia. Managerial Abstract: Diversified corporations can organize their R&D functions to be more or less centralized. Prior research has shown that this organizational choice is associated with different types of innovative outcomes. But what happens when a corporation changes its level of R&D centralization? This paper suggests that centralization of R&D gradually leads to new patterns of collaboration among inventors, which in turn will be associated with innovations that draw on and influence a wider range of technologies. However, future work is needed to understand why decentralization does not appear to have the opposite effect. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","innovation; organizational structure; R&D; social networks","Management; Planning; D-function; Formal structures; Organizational change; Organizational inertia; Organizational mechanisms; Research outcome; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089511366

HSR generates external effects across economic sectors and has the potential to transform spatial-economies. Understanding these effects is, therefore crucial for long-term urban and regional development policy and planning. This paper examines the effect of HSR development on the growth and spatial dynamics of knowledge-intensive economy (KE) in major cities of China. The analysis does not only adopt the widely used proxy of total length of HRS network, but it also includes the frequency of HSR services and its interactions with network length. HSR effects on: (a) absolute KE employment growth (b) KE spatial concentration and (c) KE regional specialisation are examined, controlling for relevant socio-economic variables. The results show that HSR network development and service frequency had varying effects on KE growth and spatial dynamics at multiple spatial scales. At the national level, HSR service frequency positively affected KE employment growth, concertation and specialisation, while HSR network expansion had a small but negative association with KE regional specialisation. Among the three main regions of China, positive effects of HSR service frequency were evident in the more prosperous eastern region. In contrast, effects were negligible in the less-developed central region. The results show that HSR development combines with existing favourable regional economic conditions to generate more growth in historically prosperous regions, thereby entrenching existing economic development imbalances. These insights could inform long-term strategic regional development policy to reduce uneven development outcomes in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; High-speed rail; HSR effects; Knowledge-intensive economy; Regional imbalance","economic growth; employment; high-speed train; knowledge economy; railway transport; regional development; regional economy; spatial variation; transportation development; uneven development; urban economy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085947642

Inference via individual proxies may result in an incomplete understanding of the relationship between financial development and economic growth, since sole proxies are unlikely to capture the true capacity of financial development. To address this issue, this paper utilizes a multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model to create a more complete measure of financial development. In doing this, we treat banking sector and stock market developments as two latent indicators of financial development and use the MIMIC model to predict them which are used as their proxies. Using data from 101 countries over the period 1990–2014, we use the predicted values of the two latent variables as regressors, among other controls, in the growth regression. We find a robust negative relationship between banking sector development and economic growth, whereas the effect of stock market development on economic growth is positive up to a threshold after which the effect becomes negative. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic growth; Financial development; Multiple indicators multiple causes","banking; economic analysis; economic development; economic growth; economic impact; financial market; financial system; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064556041

In debates over the relationship between economic growth and poverty alleviation, the inclusive growth paradigm emerged in World Bank, OECD and other development publications, becoming a UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 8). However, inclusive growth remains highly contested, and specifically, tourism's role in economic growth has been little discussed. This paper contributes to the debate by interrogating tourism-led inclusive growth using evidence from developing economies in South-East Asia, a region with booming international tourism. It raises the fundamental question whether tourism-led growth can be inclusive in the short- to medium-term, drawing on evidence from fieldwork in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Myanmar. Fieldwork utilised a rapid rural appraisal approach using qualitative methods, mainly semi-structured interviews. Although tourism can generate employment overall, this can be precarious and poorly paid, limiting opportunities for poverty alleviation. Tourism-led growth may widen inequalities in host communities and weaken backward linkages to the local economy, despite its potential for strengthening such linkages to food and non-food sectors. Remoteness and transportation also weaken such linkages. Low-income households and locally owned businesses are most affected by the construction of large-scale tourism projects – which although increasing overall tourist arrivals and expenditure - can result in the loss of land, business premises and livelihoods. In addition, privileging large capital, foreign firms and crony conglomerates is a regional trend and a major obstacle for tourism-led inclusive growth policy. Ownership patterns and destination governance also play critical roles in defining a destination's direction/pace of development, steering it towards or away from tourism-led inclusive growth. Given tourism's significance for many developing countries, the paper contributes to wider debates over inclusive growth both for theorising, and in its policy relevance for national development strategies and poverty alleviation. © 2020","Economic linkages; Inclusive growth; Poverty alleviation; South-East Asia; Tourism development","developing world; economic growth; employment generation; OECD; poverty alleviation; Sustainable Development Goal; tourism development; World Bank; Indonesia; Malaysia; Myanmar; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082670068

The GDM session may go through a number of iterations (stages) to reach a consensus. At each iteration at least one of the experts changes his/her ranking of some of the alternatives. The session terminates when a consensus has been reached or no expert is willing to alter his/her ranking. In the latter case a compromised consensus is somehow determined. It is also assumed that a data recording mechanism exists that keeps log files with information on each session and the iterations involved at each session. Such logs describe how each individual expert has ranked the alternatives at each iteration of each session. It is also assumed that there is a supervisory authority of this GDM process.

The study aims to expand the domain of economic growth by including a more in-depth analysis of the possible impact that bond market and stock market development has on economic growth than is normally found in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a panel data set of the G-20 countries for the period 1991-2016. It uses a panel vector auto-regression model to reveal the nature of any Granger causality among the five variables. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights that both bond market development and stock market development are cointegrated with economic growth, inflation rate and real interest rate. The most robust result from the panel Granger causality test is that bond market development, stock market development, inflation rate and real interest rate are demonstrable drivers of economic growth in the long run. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack theoretical foundations. Therefore, perhaps the more fully grounded interactive findings of this study can inspire theorists to fill the missing gap. Practical implications: This paper includes lessons for policymakers in the G-20 countries seeking to stimulate economic growth in the long run and how they need to ensure greater stability of the interest rate and inflation rate as well as fully developing their financial markets, as both bond markets and stock markets are obvious drivers of economic growth. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study causal relationships between bond market development, stock market development, economic growth and two other macroeconomic variables, i.e. inflation rate and real interest rate. © 2019, Rudra P.

The first model is a single-objective DEA efficiency assessment model wherein both types of outputs are integrated into a single composite efficiency measure. Using data from suppliers of Hyundai Steel Company, we determine composite efficiencies of each of these suppliers thus ranking them in terms of an overall efficiency score that would be useful as far as the first-cut supplier discrimination is concerned. However, due to the relative inability of evolved single-objective efficiency model to perform trade-offs amongst desirable and undesirable outputs and, owing to unidimensionality aspects, we evolve a goal programming based bi-objective efficiency model wherein trade-offs can be performed between both conventional and emerging dimensions criterions leading to different supplier evaluations for varied scenarios. We also integrate our evolved models with the cross-efficiency view of efficiency determination in order to enable the decision-makers to achieve peer-to-peer evaluation and maximum discrimination amongst suppliers. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","DEA; supplier selection; sustainable supply chain","Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Linear programming; Quality control; Quality management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Efficiency assessment; Environmental sustainability; Overall efficiency; Supplier efficiencies; Supplier Evaluations; Supplier performance evaluations; Supplier selection; Sustainable supply chains; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067898195

Compared to previous survey studies we add two first-of-kind variables and related findings. First, we include data on individual income, a resource-related antecedent of household sector innovation. We find that higher individual incomes are strongly associated with increased frequency of both household sector innovation and innovation diffusion. When we combine personal income effects with the positive impact of educational levels and technical training (both competence-related antecedents), it appears that increases in national development are associated with increases in household sector innovation - a very useful public policy finding. Second, in this survey we included household sector innovations motivated by personal need and additional motivations related to learning, fun, helping others and selling/commercialization. This has a major impact on estimated household sector innovation frequencies - raising them by a factor of approximately 1.4. Reanalysis of data obtained in two earlier national surveys suggests that similar adjustment factors hold in those nations too. This finding shows that prior surveys have significantly underestimated household innovation. For many research purposes, such as national accounting, the total amount and value of household sector innovation is what is of interest, independent of motivations that may drive the activity. © 2020 The Authors","Free innovation; Household sector innovation; User innovation","Digital storage; Motivation; Adjustment factors; Educational levels; Household sectors; Innovation diffusion; National accounting; National development; Technical training; User innovation; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079905564

Tests using simulations with real life consumer scanner panel data from the UK grocery retailer sector show that the algorithm performs well in finding the best items and customers to target whilst eliminating “false positives” (targeting customers who do not buy a product) and reducing “false negatives” (not targeting customers who could buy a product).

Hundreds of aid workers are killed, injured, or kidnapped when delivering supplies on the road each year. We propose the humanitarian flying warehouse (HFW) as a solution to these issues. The HFW is an airship that stays at high altitudes and uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver supplies. This innovation will enable safe and timely delivery to hard-to-reach populations in a manner that significantly exceeds the capacity of current practices. Crucially, the HFW eliminates the motivations behind many delivery disruptions. These disruptions are caused by asymmetric commons dilemmas: entities with different accessibility and power race to grab shared relief goods before others. The problem we address is the operation of HFW to make safe and timely delivery of critical items such as health supplies to the hard to reach populations. This study constitutes proof of concept for the HFW system in conflict zones through a multi-objective mathematical model. The validity of the system is verified via comparative analysis with a ground-based system in a realistic case study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Airship; Humanitarian; Logistics; Multi-objectives; Unmanned aerial vehicle","air transportation; disaster relief; humanitarian aid; innovation; numerical model; safety; storage structure; transportation planning; unmanned vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081269519

The studies generally show no or minimal impact from providing microloans to clients and have led many researchers and policy makers to conclude that microfinance has been proven to have little or no positive impacts on people's lives. We review these studies in detail and find four main results. First, we are able to replicate the results using the researcher's original data. Second, we observe that while the results are generally insignificant at traditional levels, most estimated coefficients are large. Third, every one of the studies is underpowered to detect reasonable effect sizes, often due to low take-up of the financial product offered.

Finally, when we run analysis on a pooled sample, we find a treatment effect on business profits, business revenue and household assets, significant at the 1% level.

Organisations that deploy data scientists and operational researchers (OR) must address the ethical implications of their use of data and algorithms. We review the OR and data science literature on ethics and find that this work is pitched at the level of guiding principles and frameworks and fails to provide a practical and grounded approach that can be used by practitioners as part of the analytics development process. Further, given the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) an ethical dimension is likely to become an increasingly important aspect of analytics development. Drawing on the business analytics methodology (BAM) developed by Hindle and Vidgen (2018) we tackle this challenge through action research with a pseudonymous online travel company, EuroTravel. The method that emerges uses an opportunity canvas and a business ethics canvas to explore value creation and ethical aspects jointly. The business ethics canvas draws on the Markkula Center's five ethical principles (utility, rights, justice, common good, and virtue) to which explicit consideration of stakeholders is added. A contribution of the paper is to show how an ethical dimension can be embedded in the everyday exploration of analytics development opportunities, as distinct from a stand-alone ethical decision-making tool or as an overlay of a general set of guiding principles. We also propose that value and ethics should not be viewed as separate entities, rather they should be seen as inseparable and intertwined. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Business analytics; Business ethics canvas; Data science; GDPR; Markkula","Advanced Analytics; Data Science; Decision making; Business analytics; Business ethics; Development process; Ethical decision making; Ethical implications; GDPR; General data protection regulations; Markkula; Philosophical aspects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065389516

Roughly, in these problems, one seeks to identify which individuals to strategically target in a social network so that a given proportion of the network is influenced at minimum cost. Earlier literature has focused primarily on problems where a fixed inducement is provided to those targeted. In contrast, resembling the practical viralmarketing setting, we consider this problem where one is allowed to ""partially influence""(by the use of monetary inducements) those selected for targeting. We thus focus on the ""least-cost influence problem (LCIP)"": an influence-maximization problem where the goal is to find the minimum total amount of inducements (individuals to target and associated tailored incentive) required to influence a given proportion of the population. Motivated by the desire to develop a better understanding of fundamental problems in social-network analytics, we seek to develop (exact) optimization approaches for the LCIP. Our paper makes several contributions, including (i) showing that the problem is NPcomplete in general as well as under a wide variety of special conditions; (ii) providing an influence greedy algorithm to solve the problem polynomially on trees, where we require 100% adoption and all neighbors exert equal influence on a node; and (iii) a totally unimodular formulation for this tree case.

Often simplified as an act of corporate social responsibility, the complexity of the engagement concept means its processes and consequences evade closer scrutiny and analysis. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of stakeholder engagement to reveal its theoretical and practical complexity; two complimentary models of stakeholder engagement are mobilized to analyze empirical data from a hospital case-study project. The result is a retheorization of stakeholder engagement as a complex entwined process of responsibility, organizational action, and work package requirements where stakeholder engagement and agency (i.e., ethical treatment of stakeholders) are understood as separate variables that result in shifts among responsible, paternalistic, neoclassic, and strategic behaviors. The contribution lies in a more sophisticated understanding of stakeholder engagement being attained: shifts between stakeholder engagement and agency define relations between parties in corporate social responsibility (CSR) terms; the ethical aspirations of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) organizations are impacted by daily project activities; and the unique characteristics of stakeholder engagement in construction (e.g., binding of party interests, effect of subcontractor entry, and collective blame/praise) are brought into focus.

Most relevant studies have developed models that predicted the probability of business failure within 1 year using financial ratios. Although a few studies have attempted to use nonfinancial information, they did not provide empirical evidence that this addition can improve the prediction performance of a model. To address these problems, this study proposed a model that used not only accounting variables but also construction market and macroeconomic variables to predict failure probability from 1 to 3 years. We examined the effects of combinations of these variables on the business failure prediction performance of construction contractors in the United States and compared the effects of combinations of these variables between three models that predict business failure within 1, 2, and 3 years. This study developed a prediction model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a deep-learning algorithm. The results showed that the prediction model using both the construction market and macroeconomic variables had approximately 2%, 3%, and 4% higher prediction performance compared with that using only accounting variables when predicting within 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. This means that the business failure prediction model had superior prediction performance from a long-term perspective when the construction market and macroeconomic variables were used in addition to accounting variables. The results of this study are expected to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of input variable selection on the prediction performance for each prediction period and useful references for improving performance of predicting business failure of construction contractors. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Business failure; Construction contractors; Construction market variables; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Macroeconomic variables; Prediction model; Recurrent neural network (RNN)","Brain; Commerce; Construction industry; Contractors; Deep learning; Forecasting; Plant shutdowns; Business failure; Construction contractors; Construction markets; Macroeconomic variables; Prediction model; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Long short-term memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075709322

Approaches based upon cost, time and quality (often called the Iron Triangle), have been the focus of attention despite criticism of the validity of the Iron Triangle as a performance measure due to its simplistic approach. Furthermore, little emphasis has been placed on synthesising performance to understand whether this concept has evolved from the traditional view. An analysis of prominent literature was reviewed by classifying performance indicators which establish criteria for measuring performance in the construction industry. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature (1998–2018) on performance at a project level to determine a final rank of key performance indicators (KPIs) which will establish how projects are currently being measured. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a combined qualitative and quantitative approach – a comprehensive literature review on overall performance at a project level and the statistical Kendall’s W test to find concordance among the authors on performance in the construction industry to determine a final rank of KPIs. Findings: The results demonstrate there is no congruent correlation on what performance is and the traditional iron triangle of “cost-time-quality” is still the preferred method of analysing performance, despite it being proven to be ineffective. Originality/value: Performance in the construction industry is an ambiguous concept that can be interpreted differently by the construction industry’s stakeholders. Despite this lack of concordance, a starting point on the definition of performance can be obtained from the literature. The paper presents a final rank of KPIs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Integrated practice; Management; Project management","Benchmarking; Construction; Construction industry; Iron; Management; Design/methodology/approach; Focus of Attention; Integrated practice; Key performance indicators; Measuring performance; Performance indicators; Performance measure; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073937141

The research employs fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), and examines trust, enterprising negotiation power, tourism decision-making considerations and crisis effects. It also includes the categorical data of operational mode and company type. Findings: The analysis has generated three different pathways for entrepreneurial decision-making during crisis in the Greek tourism and hospitality sector. These pathways are (1) crisis conditions, (2) enterprising operations and focus and (3) enterprising capabilities. Research limitations/implications: Due to the limited employment of fsQCA in the tourism sector, its full potential is still to be explored. Practical implications: The study provides three different pathways that Greek tourism entrepreneurs select for their decision-making according to the characteristics of their firms and their market orientation.

Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs.

We apply Granger causality and cointegration tests, PMG ARDL and PDOLS, and a two-step system GMM to a sample of 109 economies and two sub-samples (62 low- and middle-income economies (LMEs), 47 high-income economies (HIEs)) over the period of 1998–2017. The Granger causality tests show long-run bi-directional causality between internet/mobile usage and financial development. We find that internet usage has a significant negative impact on overall financial development, which could be attributed to a negative impact on financial institutions with all their three dimensions, depth, access, and efficiency. At the same time, internet has significant positive impact on financial markets with its three dimensions. Contrary to the opposing effects internet usage, mobile usage has a significant positive impact on all nine indices of financial development. The PMG ARDL and PDOLS estimations clarify that the positive impact of the internet is a short run effect, while the negative effect is a long-run one. The mobile usage impact is a long-run phenomenon.

By utilizing the data of additional reviews (ARs), an innovative social media module for customers to express follow-up opinions that complement their initial reviews, we examine the impact of MR treatment on the customers' AR valence. We leverage the insight that the observability of MR at the time of the responded customer posts an AR is a crucial condition to the impact of the MR, and thus regard the observability of MR as an exogenous treatment for model identification. Fixed effects models with extensive control variables are proposed to estimate the MR treatment effects. The results show that MRs have significant positive impacts on customers' satisfaction in ARs. Further explorations show that the positive impacts are mainly due to the positive effects of MRs on nonpositive initial reviews (MR-Ns), suggesting that MR-Ns are an effective management tool for customer complaints. Moreover, this study identifies MR delay as a boundary condition for the internality of MRs because MR delay negatively moderates the positive impacts of MRs. Therefore, companies should promptly respond to customers' negative opinions in their reviews. This study is among the very first to clearly identify the internality of MRs on the responded customers’ satisfaction. We show that the existing results on the externality of MRs are not directly applicable to the internality of MRs, highlighting the novelty of this study.

In this study, consistent with forms of opportunism observed in our context of manufacturing outsourcing, we examine two different forms of perceived opportunism—perceived poaching and shirking. As narratives of the hidden costs of outsourcing discuss concerns of suppliers in emerging economies engaging in poaching and shirking, we examine if the level of economic development where a supplier operates affects perceptions of supplier poaching and shirking and also examine if the supplier's competitive priorities moderate those perceptions. To empirically test these relationships, we combine archival data of location characteristics with a dyadic primary dataset that captures perceived supplier opportunism, self-reported supplier opportunism, and other relationship characteristics. Our findings illustrate that perceived opportunism and opportunism are distinct constructs and that more observable forms of opportunism (i.e., shirking) affect perceived opportunism more than less observable forms of opportunism (i.e., poaching). We also find that, in existing relationships, manufacturers in advanced economies perceive poaching to be more strongly related to the level of economic development where a supplier operates than shirking. Finally, we find that while a cost focus can mitigate perceptions of poaching, an innovation focus exacerbates them. Overall, our study illustrates the challenges that innovation-focused suppliers in emerging economies face in regards to competing with suppliers in advanced economies. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","cost priority; emerging economies; innovation priority; outsourcing; perceived opportunism; sensemaking","Costs; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Outsourcing; Statistical tests; Advanced economies; Archival data; Competitive priorities; Emerging economies; Manufacturing outsourcings; Outsourcing relationships; Transaction cost; Transaction cost economics; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091730167

These automated systems have already been adopted in developed countries like Australia and the United States. In recent years research has emerged to address the awareness and preparedness of stakeholders towards the adaption of Autonomous Mining Systems dedicated towards African countries. The present study is a novel effort in evaluating the current scale of knowledge and skills of mining engineers working in Pakistan's mining industry, government sector, and academia. The study focuses on exploring the awareness about the understanding of the autonomous mining systems, and the level of preparedness of all the stakeholders towards the adoption of this modern technology, along with the resulting social impacts, in a developing country like Pakistan. This paper employed closed and open-ended questionnaires, distributed in electronic formats, to achieve the aforementioned objective. The results were analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis and quantitatively using results synthesis employing statistical analysis in Python. Substantial evidence has been provided indicating a huge knowledge gap and severe lack of planning and policy enforcement towards the adoption of autonomous mining systems in Pakistan. More than 74% of the respondents, with the majority of them belonging to industry and academia, appeared willing to accept the adoption of autonomous mining systems in Pakistan, due to the resulting improvements in safety and productivity. However, government agencies had varied opinions, with the knowledge gap and the fear of increased unemployment being the major reasons for their resistance to technology adoption. The majority of the graduate mining engineers (60.35%) mentioned the inadequacy of the undergraduate and graduate coursework for providing skills needed to work with autonomous systems. Therefore, it is recommended that the mining curriculum be revised to contain more courses that are relevant to gaining skills in autonomous mining. A government-industry-academia collaboration is also recommended to fund and develop facilities that can help bridge this existing knowledge gap, thus facilitating an early adoption of modern technology in Pakistan's mining sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous mining systems; Machine learning; Pakistan; Process automation; Unemployment","Accident prevention; Automation; Developing countries; Engineers; Mining machinery; Productivity; Surveys; Automated technology; Autonomous systems; Developed countries; Government agencies; Modern technologies; Open-ended questionnaire; Policy enforcement; Technology adoption; Economic and social effects; automation; developing world; efficiency measurement; industrial performance; industrial policy; mining; mining industry; policy approach; safety; technology adoption; workplace; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088109528

That research has focused primarily on the fit between business and IT strategies, while cross-domain alignment, i.e., alignment between business strategy and IT infrastructure components, has received far less attention. Further, previous studies have focused on the implications of alignment for firm performance while the effects of cross-domain alignment on business unit performance in multi-business organizations (MBOs) are yet to be examined. This issue is important as IT infrastructures are evolving rapidly. Specifically, MBOs are increasingly turning to corporate IT platforms to support a common set of shared IT needs, while still allowing individual business units to manage unique aspects of their own IT needs through local IT applications. Extending prior research, this study proposes that performance of business units in MBOs is influenced by two complementary forms of cross-domain alignment, viz., alignment between the corporate IT platform and the corporate business strategy, and alignment between the business unit's portfolio of IT applications and its business strategy. Using data from a global survey of 120 organizations, we find evidence that complementarity between these two forms of cross-domain alignment creates a joint positive effect on business unit performance. We also find that this effect varies with the extent of process digitization within business units.

Failure of equipment and process subsystems are among the primary causes of abnormal situations. The conventional approach in handling failure-based abnormal situations has usually focused on operational strategies. Such an approach overlooks the critical role of process design in mitigating failure, while simultaneously considering the effects of such failure on process economic performance. The aim of this work is to introduce a systematic methodology that accounts for failure early enough during the conceptual design stages. Once a base-case design is developed, the methodology starts by identifying the sources of failure that are caused by reliability issues including equipment, operational procedures, and human errors for a given process system or subsystem. This allows for the identification of critical process subsystem(s) that are more failure-prone or cause greater downtime than other subsystems. Bayesian updating and Monte Carlo techniques are utilized to determine the appropriate distributions for the failure and repair scenario(s), respectively, in question. Markov analysis is used to determine the system availability. Next, the process revenue is described as a function of inherent availability. The effects of failures are incorporated into profitability calculations to establish an economic framework for trading off failure and profitability. In the proposed framework, the economic potential of alternative design scenarios is evaluated and an optimization formulation with the objective of maximizing incremental return on investment (IROI) is utilized to make a design decision. A case study on an ethylene plant is solved to demonstrate the applicability and value of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Design; Failure; Process integration; Profitability; Reliability","Conceptual design; Ethylene; Monte Carlo methods; Process design; Profitability; Supply chains; Conceptual design stages; Conventional approach; Monte Carlo techniques; Operational procedures; Operational strategies; Optimization formulations; Reliability , availability , and maintainabilities; Systematic methodology; Availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089702314

Although the PPP body of knowledge continues to grow, the functioning of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) formed to pursue PPP projects, particularly the relationships among SPV equity investors, remains largely unexplored. Building on concepts from the PPP and social network analysis (SNA) domains, the main goal of this study is to examine the patterns of behavior associated with SPV equity investors participating in the PPP tendering processes. The methodology uses data from public and proprietary databases to examine the networks of relationships among PPP equity providers within the road infrastructure sectors in Canada, Chile, and the United States over the last 26 years. The main outcome of this analysis is a characterization of the PPP equity markets in these three countries. Results show that PPP investors seemingly exhibit collaboration-based connections in the Canadian network, competition-based relationships in the Chilean market, and a combination of competition and collaboration features in the US network. Conclusions suggest that, despite their differences, the PPP networks studied are complex and self-organizing structures that exhibit preferential attachment mechanisms between central and peripheral players. Future studies are suggested to add insight on the ways that PPP markets and SPVs mutually influence one another and affect project performance. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Equity providers; Public-private partnership (PPP) procurement; Public-private partnerships; Social network analysis; Special purpose vehicle","Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Roads and streets; Body of knowledge; Equity investors; Preferential attachments; Procurement process; Project performance; Public private partnerships; Road infrastructures; Self-organizing structures; Internet protocols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087939088

The multifaceted impacts of short-term rentals, including increases in housing prices, changes in neighborhood character, and loses of revenue for hotels, have invited regulation from city governments. The City of New Orleans passed laws in December 2016 designed to regulate the short-term rental market and prevent further unfettered growth. This paper evaluates those regulations on the number and character of Airbnbs in the city prior to and after the enforcement of the laws. The regulations temporarily reduced the overall number of Airbnb's in New Orleans, but growth has resumed after a one-time decline.

We term this phenomenon ""supercharging""and test our thesis using data from a digital-first men's apparel retailer and a pioneer of the so-called zero inventory store (ZIS) format-a small-footprint, experience-centric retail location that carries no inventory for immediate fulfillment, but fulfils orders via e-commerce. Using a risk-set matching approach, we calibrate our estimates on customers who are ""treated,""that is, have a ZIS experience, and matched with identical customers who shop online only. We find that after the ZIS experience, customers spend more, shop at a higher velocity, and are less likely to return items. The positive impact on returns is doubly virtuous as it is more pronounced for more tactile, higher-priced items, thus mitigating a key pain point of online retail. Furthermore, the ZIS shopping experience aids product discovery and brand attachment, causing sales to becomemore diffuse over a larger number of categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our results are robust to self-selection and potentially confounding effects of unobservable factors on the matched pairs of customers.

This study aims to examine the joint influences of institution-based, process-based and characteristic-based antecedents on customers' trust and continuance intention toward ride-sharing. Furthermore, the study aims to investigate if the relative influences of institution-based and process-based antecedents on trust are contingent upon customers' prior experience. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon trust-building literature and the elaboration-likelihood model, we developed a research model and conducted an online survey to users of Didi, the largest ride-sharing platform in China. We used the structural equation modeling technique to analyze the collected data and examine the proposed research model. Findings: Ther major research findings of the study suggest that structural assurance, government support, platform reputation and disposition to trust exhibit significant and different degrees of influences on customers' trust beliefs and continuance intention toward ride-sharing. A multi-group analysis further suggests that customers with less use experience focus more on government support and platform reputation, while customers with more use experience are more likely influenced by structural assurance. Originality/value: The study contributes to the extant literature by identifying the joint influences of institutional-based, process-based and characteristic-based antecedents on users' continuance intention of ride-sharing service and uncovers the mediation mechanism of trust and perceived risk. Moreover, the study refines the boundary condition of the proposed research model by revealing the moderating effect of use experience. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Elaboration-likelihood model; Ride-sharing; Trust building; Use experience","Industrial engineering; Industrial management; Behavioral intention; Continuance intentions; Design/methodology/approach; Disposition to trusts; Elaboration likelihood models; Government supports; Moderating effect; Structural equation modeling techniques; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086834907

Using structural equation modeling, this paper proposes and tests two new theoretical constructs that could be useful for understanding management of megaproject crises. The study proposes crisis orientation and crisis awareness as prominent antecedents to better anticipation of megaproject crises. Crisis orientation is a second-order construct that builds upon five independent first-order dimensions: lack of project management skills; clash of interest; lack of responsibility; red tape and centralization; and lack of ability to forecast. In addition, the paper suggests a first-order construct (crisis awareness) affects predictable risks concern. The survey results of 168 individuals in Chinese megaprojects suggest that higher crisis orientation and crisis awareness support higher predictable risks concern. The findings imply that strategies aimed at enhancing crisis orientation and crisis awareness would promote early detection and mitigation of future crises. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association","Crisis awareness; Crisis critical factors; Crisis orientation; Megaproject; Public project","Economic and social effects; Risk management; Crisis management; Crisis management systems; Critical factors; Leadership competence; Mega projects; Public project; Social responsibilities; Stakeholder management; Surveys; antecedent conditions; equation; modeling; project management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066472178

The goal is to find a policy for deciding on the assortment to offer to each customer so that the total expected revenue over a finite selling horizon is maximized. The dynamic-programming formulation of this problem requires a high-dimensional state variable that keeps track of the on-hand product inventories, as well as the products that are currently in use. We present a tractable approach to compute a policy that is guaranteed to obtain at least 50% of the optimal total expected revenue. This policy is based on constructing linear approximations to the optimal value functions. When the usage duration is infinite or follows a negative binomial distribution, we also show how to efficiently perform rollout on a simple static policy. Performing rollout corresponds to using separable and nonlinear value function approximations. The resulting policy is also guaranteed to obtain at least 50% of the optimal total expected revenue. The special case of our model with infinite usage durations captures the case where the customers purchase the products outright without returning them at all. Under infinite usage durations, we give a variant of our rollout approach whose total expected revenue differs from the optimal by a factor that approaches 1 with rate cubic-root of Cmin, where Cmin is the smallest inventory of a product. We provide computational experiments based on simulated data for dynamic assortment management, as well as real parking transaction data for the city of Seattle. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the practical performance of our policies is substantially better than their performance guarantees and that performing rollout yields noticeable improvements. © 2020 INFORMS","Choice modeling; Dynamic assortment optimization; Reusable products","Sales; Assortment optimization; Computational experiment; Linear approximations; Negative binomial distribution; Optimal value functions; Performance guarantees; Product inventory; Value function approximation; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090391292

However, it is debatable whether such targeting is truly effective. While advocates argue that online shopping should complement a firm’s store channel, critics counter that doing so may result in cannibalization. Drawing on the channel interplay literature and considering customers’ travel costs, we examine whether and how inducing online shopping complements or cannibalizes a firm’s offline sales. Using a randomized field experiment on over 11,200 customers of a large department store, we provide causal evidence for both the complementarity and cannibalization effects of online and offline channels. Offline-to-online targeting engenders higher online purchases (as intended) than no targeting. The local average treatment effects models suggest that once induced to buy online, consumers who live near the retailer’s physical store tend to increase their offline spending and total sales by 47% (i.e., complementarity effects for nearby consumers). However, for consumers who live far away from the brick-and-mortar store, inducing them to buy online can backfire by reducing offline and total sales by approximately 5.7% for each additional kilometer of distance (i.e., cannibalization effects for distant consumers). Explorations of these mechanisms suggest that distant consumers who are induced to buy online may fail to return to shop in the offline store and purchase less experiential category products with a smaller basket size than other customers, thus leading to a negative net impact on the total sales. These findings alert managers to the dangers of improper targeting and investment in information technology and the importance of consumer heterogeneity for omnichannel commerce across online and offline channels. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84–27.7m€/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Economics of science; Equipment; Open source; Open source hardware; Research expenditures; Research tools","Economics; Economics of science; Open sources; Open-source hardwares; Research expenditure; Research tools; Open systems; accessibility; economic policy; equipment; hardware; public spending; research; technology policy; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081018523

The prevailing belief is that digital banking has several advantages, such as lower costs and higher information transferability for customers. These benefits can also promote competition between banks given customers' predilection for “multi-homing,” or engagement with multiple banks. This study investigated the impact of customers' digital banking adoption on hidden defection, in which customers purchase financial products from competing banks instead of their primary banks. To this end, we developed an analytical model to provide insights into the effects of digital banking adoption while taking customers' multi-homing behaviors into consideration. We then conducted a series of empirical analyses using comprehensive individual-level transaction data to provide evidence of hidden defection. Our findings indicate that customers with higher loyalty exhibit greater hidden defection after digital banking adoption. Customers who engage primarily with personal-service channels (e.g., branches) show stronger hidden defection than do self-service channel (e.g., ATMs) users, and this effect is more prevalent among loyal customers. Our results provide valuable implications for omni-channel services in a market characterized by multi-homing behavior of customers. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","analytical model; customer defection; difference-in-differences model; digital banking adoption; econometric analysis; FinTech; information stickiness; multi-homing; omni-channel strategy; online and mobile banking; panel data; transaction cost economics","Analytical models; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Defects; Channel strategies; Customer defections; Difference-in-differences models; digital banking adoption; Econometric analysis; FinTech; information stickiness; Mobile bankings; Multi-homing; Panel data; Transaction cost economics; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075486028

The index is constructed by aggregating six distinct dimensional indices capturing different dimensions of corporate governance, namely board effectiveness, audit function, risk management, remuneration, shareholder rights and information, and disclosure and transparency. For aggregation, a tailored version of data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach which is popularly known as constrained ‘Benefit-of-the-Doubt (BoD)’ model is employed. This approach is unique and distinctive in the sense that it requires no a priori knowledge of weights, and assigns endogenous weights obtained from actual data to individual dimensions of bank governance in order to construct a composite index of corporate governance. This methodological framework has illustrated by applying it for a data set of 40 Indian banks operating in the year 2017. The data set has been compiled using 58 governance regulations as defined by relevant jurisdictions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benefit-of-the-doubt model; Composite indicators; Corporate governance index; Data envelopment analysis; Indian banks","banking; data envelopment analysis; governance approach; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064199506

We study this problem when customers are heterogeneous with respect to their initial valuations for the good and their time sensitivities-that is, the customers differ in both their initial valuations and the rates at which their initial valuation decreases with a delay in the purchase. Academic/practical relevance: In many settings, especially in fashion and electronic retail, a customer's valuation for the product is time-sensitive and decreases over time. In these situations, customers are not only different in terms of their initial willingness to pay for these products when they are first introduced to the market, but they are also different in terms of how rapidly they lose interest in these products. We show that when a firm sells products in such settings, it can realize significant benefits by incorporating dynamic pricing, even in the absence of demand uncertainty. Methodology: Dynamic mechanism design. Results: We characterize the optimal mechanism for selling durable goods when the customers differ in both their initial valuations and the rates at which their initial valuation decreases. We show that delayed allocation and dynamic pricing can be effective screening tools for maximizing firm profit and can also increase social welfare. We also investigate the impact of production and holding costs on the optimal mechanism. Managerial implications: Our work shows how firms can exploit scenarios in which their customers have time-sensitive valuations and are forward-looking to achieve a win-win, by both generating additional revenue and improving social welfare. © 2020 INFORMS","Delay sensitivity; Dynamic pricing; Patience; Retail pricing; Time-sensitive valuations","Costs; Economics; Machine design; Demand uncertainty; Dynamic mechanism; Managerial implications; Optimal mechanism; Problem definition; Revenue management; Time sensitivity; Willingness to pay; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092627810

This measure helps to address a disconnect between the common theoretical assumption that managers optimize firm value, and the widespread empirical practice of measuring performance using short-term ratios such as return on assets (ROA). LIVA can lead to markedly different strategic insights compared to commonly used measures such as ROA and cumulative abnormal returns. For instance, the widely cited finding of a U-shaped relation between acquisition experience and performance turns out to be largely driven by short-term stock price movements and vanishes when using 10-year LIVA. Managerial summary: Managers have a large number of performance measures at their disposal, such as return on assets, total shareholder returns, and earnings before interest and taxes. However, these short-term measures do not capture well whether a firm creates long-term shareholder value, which is one of the primary objectives for most firms. Addressing that gap, this article introduces a new measure called long-term investor value appropriation (LIVA). LIVA can be constructed using publicly available stock market data and it can help managers to better analyze historical long-term performance. © 2019 The Authors.

The recommended candidate method is the one that provided the most robust output (solution to the problem). Only methods that deal with a discrete set of choices were considered. In the Boeing strategic decision presented in this paper, two MCDM methods were compared and a recommendation was made after calculating the minimum percentage change in performance measures and criteria weights required to change the ranking of any two alternatives. An MCDM method was recommended based on a compromise between the minimum percentage change that was required in the inputs to change the ranking of alternatives.

In order to help improve crowd performance, our research strives to investigate the impact of crowd characteristics on crowd performance. We conduct an empirical study using a large data set collected from a popular online investment community, StockTwits. Our findings show that experience diversity, participant independence, and network decentralization are all positively related to crowd performance. Furthermore, crowd size moderates the influence of crowd characteristics on crowd performance. From a theoretical perspective, our work enriches extant literature by empirically testing the relationship between crowd characteristics and crowd performance.

The levels of the countries’ sustainable development are captured by data envelopment analysis, a nonparametric frontier approach that can jointly assess a country's economic and environmental performance. Reflecting the divergent views on the importance of economic and environmental objectives in the pursuit of sustainability, the proposed approach generates the countries’ sustainability scores by prioritizing either economic or environmental criterion. This study finds that developed countries have significantly outperformed developing countries if environmental criterion takes precedence over economic criterion in performance assessment. Moreover, regardless of the model employed, there is strong evidence of club convergence, i.e., convergence in subgroups of countries to different steady states rather than convergence in full sample.

Despite the importance of consumers in low-carbon economies, so far, most studies have ignored low-carbon consumer behaviour in developing countries that are vulnerable to climate change and its consequences. This indicates inattention to the socio-economic aspects of the general life style of the people in promoting sustainable consumption and accountability. This study examines the determinants of low-carbon consumption behaviour of consumers in climate-vulnerable developing countries by focusing on consumers in Sri Lanka. Combining the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Theory of Perceived Marketplace Influence (TPMI), the data collected from 440 Sri Lankan consumers was analysed using a structural equation model. The findings revealed the antecedent variables of TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) and the additional variables (i.e. low-carbon-self-identity and implementation intention) that fully explains the carbon-conscious decision-making phenomenon in a developing country setting. The results confirm the appropriateness of the proposed model for predicting low-carbon consumer behaviour in climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka as it increases the predictive power of the TPB framework. Accordingly, policy level implications and strategies for promoting individual low-carbon consumption behaviour are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Developing countries; Low-carbon consumption; Sri Lanka; Theory of perceived marketplace influence; Theory of planned behaviour","Carbon; Climate models; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Developing countries; Renewable energy resources; Implementation intentions; Low-carbon consumption; Perceived behavioural controls; Sri Lanka; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable consumption; Theory of perceived marketplace influence; Theory of planned behaviour; Climate change; carbon; climate change; consumption behavior; decision making; developing world; lifestyle; policy approach; socioeconomic conditions; adult; Article; behavior theory; climate; consumer attitude; decision making; developing country; female; human; low carbon consumer behavior; major clinical study; male; social norm; Sri Lanka; Theory of Perceived Marketplace Influence; Theory of Planned Behavior; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075287101

We propose a theory of how certain labor market institutions affect diversity, and through that route affect levels of innovation. Specifically, unemployment protection (UP) encourages diversity by reducing the risk burden of a broad range of learning, or human capital investment; for that reason, UP fosters innovation. Employment protection (EP) reduces the risk burden of a much narrower range of learning; for this reason, it will not enhance diversity to the extent UP does, and it may actually depress overall diversity and innovation. Our approach differs from previous research on labor market insurance and skill formation, much of which has dealt with a distinction between general and specific skills, and which has treated the effects of UP and EP as similar. Estimating the effects of UP and EP on patenting for 25 OECD countries over 24 years, we find a positive effect from UP, a negative effect from EP, and evidence that the UP effect is mediated by diversity of skill. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Active labor market policy; Employment protection; Evolutionary economics; Human capital; Innovation; National systems of innovation; Skills; Social insurance; Unemployment insurance; Varieties of capitalism","Commerce; Employment; Insurance; Personnel; Evolutionary Economics; Human capitals; Labor market policy; National systems of innovations; Skills; Varieties of capitalism; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073193733

On the other hand, AM technology in directed energy deposition (DED) has been evolving in both: processing capabilities and adaptable configuration for integration within existing traditional machines that are available in most SME manufacturing facilities, e.g. computer numerical control (CNC) machining centers. Integrating DED with conventional processes such as machining and grinding into Hybrid AM is well suited for remanufacturing of metal parts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Classical facility location models are employed to understand the effects of SMEs adopting DED systems to offer remanufacturing services. This study identifies strategically located counties in the USA to advance hybrid AM for reverse logistics using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) data on geographical data, demand, fixed and transportation costs. A case study is also implemented to explore its implications on remanufacturing of high-value parts on the reverse logistics supply chain using an aerospace part and NAICS data on aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities. Findings: The results identify the candidate counties, their allocations, allocated demand and total costs. Offering AM remanufacturing services to traditional manufacturers decreases costs for SMEs in the supply chain by minimizing expensive new part replacement. The hubs also benefit from hybrid AM to repair their own parts and tools. Originality/value: This research provides a unique analysis on reverse logistics through hybrid AM focused on remanufacturing rather than manufacturing. Facility location using real data is used to obtain results and offers insights into integrating AM for often overlooked aspect of remanufacturing. The study shows that SMEs can participate in the evolving AM economy through remanufacturing services using significantly lower investment costs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Advanced manufacturing technology; Directed energy deposition; Facility location; Hybrid manufacturing; Metal repair; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Supply chain","3D printers; Additives; Computer control systems; Deposition; Facilities; Grinding (machining); Industrial research; Investments; Location; Metals; Repair; Supply chains; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Directed energy; Facility locations; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071552161

Most, if not all, reputation systems examined in the extant literature reflect the sellers’ long-term accumulative reputation, which has several drawbacks that impede accomplishing the intended goals of the reputation systems. Taobao.com, the largest consumer-to-consumer online market in China, implemented the Gold Medal Seller (GMS) program as a concurrent reputation mechanism to enhance its existing long-term accumulative reputation system. The GMS program presents a backdrop that allows us to address several intriguing research issues not empirically examined in prior literature. By adopting multiple causal identification strategies, we find that earning a reputation badge has a positive impact on sales, and losing a reputation badge has a negative impact on sales. More importantly, the signaling value of obtaining/losing a reputation badge is asymmetric: The magnitude of the effect of losing a reputation badge is four times larger than that of earning a badge. Moreover, consecutively keeping a reputation badge or earning it multiple times is a stronger signal for seller quality and has a larger positive impact on sales, which suggests that the marginal value of reputation badges increases. Our findings offer a new and deeper understanding of the reputation system mechanism design. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","countersignaling; online markets; Reputation system; reputations badges; signaling","Electronic commerce; Gold; Machine design; Sales; Identification strategies; Marginal values; Mechanism design; Online markets; Online sellers; Reputation mechanism; Reputation systems; Research issues; Online systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096903866

However, IPD lacks an accurate cost estimation methodology at the “front-end” of projects, when little project information is available. This study aims to tackle this issue, through presenting analytical aspects, theoretical grounds and practical steps/procedures for integrating target value design (TVD), activity-based costing (ABC) and Monte Carlo simulation into the IPD cost structure, within a BIM-enabled platform. Design/methodology/approach: A critical review was conducted to study the status of cost estimation within IPD, as well as exploring methods and tools that can enhance the cost estimation process for IPD. Thereafter, a framework is developed to present the proposed methodology of cost estimation for IPD throughout its entire stages. A case project is used to validate the practicality of the developed solution through comparing the profit-at-risk percentage for each party, using both traditional cost estimation and the proposed solution. Findings: After applying the proposed IPD's cost estimation framework, on a real-life case project, the findings demonstrated significant deviations in the profit-at-risk value for various work packages of the project (approximately 100% of the finishing package and 22% of openings package). By providing a precise allocation of overhead costs, the solution can be used in real-life projects to change the entire IPD cost structure and ensure a fair sharing of risk–rewards among the involved parties in IPD projects. Practical implications: Using the proposed methodology of cost estimation for IPD can enhance the relationship among IPD's core team members; all revealed financial deficiencies will be considered (i.e. compensation structure, profit pooling), hence enhancing the IPD performance. Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive solution for integrating BIM and IPD in terms of cost estimation, offering three main contributions: (1) an innovate approach to utilise five-dimensional (5D) BIM capabilities with Monte Carlo simulation, hence providing reliable cost estimating during the conceptual TVD stage; (2) mathematical models that are developed through integrating ABC into the detailed 5D BIM to determine the three IPD's cost structure limbs; and (3) a novel mechanism of managing cost saving (rewards) through distinguishing between saved resources from organisation level, to daily task level, to increase trust among parties. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","5D BIM; Alliancing; Collaboration; IPD; Partnering agreement; Procurement; Simulation","Architectural design; Cost accounting; Estimation; Metals; Monte Carlo methods; Profitability; Project management; Risk perception; Structural design; Activity based costing; Building Information Modelling; Compensation structure; Design/methodology/approach; Integrated project deliveries; Project delivery; Project informations; Target value designs; Cost estimating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087734935

However in stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), application of these techniques has been sparse and the case for such models has not received attention in the appropriate academic literature. This paper fills this gap and explores the robust properties of MI within the stochastic frontier context. From a methodological perspective, we depart from the standard MI literature by demonstrating, conceptually and through simulation, that it is not appropriate to use imputations of the dependent variable within the SFA modelling, although they can be useful to predict the values of missing explanatory variables. Fundamentally, this is because efficiency analysis involves decomposing a residual into noise and inefficiency and as a result any imputation of a dependent variable would be imputing efficiency based on some concept of average inefficiency in the sample. A further contribution that we discuss and illustrate for the first time in the SFA literature, is that using auxiliary variables (outside of those contained in the SFA model) can enhance the imputations of missing values. Our empirical example neatly articulates that often the source of missing data is only a sub-set of components comprising a part of a composite (or complex) measure and that the other parts that are observed are very useful in predicting the value. © 2019","Efficiency analysis; Missing data; Multiple imputation; Production; Stochastic frontier analysis","Efficiency; Production; Stochastic models; Academic literature; Auxiliary variables; Efficiency analysis; Explanatory variables; Missing data; Missing data methods; Multiple imputation; Stochastic frontier analysis; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069646233

A stochastic directional distance function (SDDF) allows for noise in potentially all input and output variables. Yet, when estimated, the direction selected will affect the functional estimates because deviations from the estimated function are minimized in the specified direction. Specifically, the parameters of the parametric SDDF are point identified when the direction is specified; we show that the parameters of the parametric SDDF are set identified when multiple directions are considered. Further, the set of identified parameters can be narrowed via data-driven approaches to restrict the directions considered. We demonstrate a similar narrowing of the identified parameter set for a shape constrained nonparametric method, where the shape constraints impose standard features of a cost function such as monotonicity and convexity. Our Monte Carlo simulation studies reveal significant improvements, as measured by out of sample radial mean squared error, in functional estimates when we use a directional distance function with an appropriately selected direction and the errors are uncorrelated across variables. We show that these benefits increase as the correlation in error terms across variables increase. This correlation is a type of endogeneity that is common in production settings. From our Monte Carlo simulations we conclude that selecting a direction that is approximately orthogonal to the estimated function in the central region of the data gives significantly better estimates relative to the directions commonly used in the literature. For practitioners, our results imply that selecting a direction vector that has non-zero components for all variables that may have measurement error provides a significant improvement in the estimator's performance. We illustrate these results using cost and production data from samples of approximately 500 US hospitals per year operating in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, and find that the shape constrained nonparametric methods provide a significant increase in flexibility over second order local approximation parametric methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Hospital production; Nonparametric regression; Shape constraints","Cost functions; Data envelopment analysis; Errors; Hospitals; Intelligent systems; Mean square error; Orthogonal functions; Stochastic systems; Data-driven approach; Direction selection; Directional distance function; Functional estimate; Identified parameter; Non-parametric regression; Nonparametric methods; Shape constraints; Monte Carlo methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068542949

A better understanding of emergency department (ED) performance during disaster-level overcrowding is a key to increasing a facility's resilience, optimizing patient outcomes, and more effectively allocating resources. With this in mind, this study quantitatively examines the extent to which different factors contribute to the resilience of hospital EDs during disaster-level overcrowding events. A modeling framework was developed in collaboration with the Carilion Clinic ED, a level one trauma center in Virginia. The testing and analysis of the approach is based on data from actual disaster-level overcrowding events that occurred in the Spring of 2016. Results indicate that by considering not only the capacity for resisting such events but also the capacity for recovering from them more quickly, hospital decision makers can improve both their operational effectiveness and the patient experience. Furthermore, by using our framework to identify precipitating factors and predict severe overcrowding, hospital decision makers can implement changes to improve the future resilience of their ED to such overcrowding events. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","component resilience; decision support; hospital operations; multievent disasters; overcrowding; predicted resilience","Decision making; Decision support systems; Emergency rooms; Patient rehabilitation; component resilience; Decision supports; Hospital operations; overcrowding; predicted resilience; Disasters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063884221

Several endogenous and exogenous variables can influence the dynamics of demand, and hence a single statistical model that only consists of historical sales data is often insufficient to produce accurate forecasts. In practice, the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often judgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information that are not incorporated in the baseline models. There are however systematic events whose effect can be quantified and modeled to help minimize human intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts. In this paper, we develop and test a novel regime-switching approach to quantify systematic information/events and objectively incorporate them into the baseline statistical model. Our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit forecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such as sudden climate change or dynamic market activities. The model is validated empirically using sales and promotional data from two Australian companies. The model is also benchmarked against commonly employed statistical and machine learning forecasting models. Discussions focus on thorough analysis of promotions impact and benchmarking results. We show that the proposed model can successfully improve forecast accuracy and avoid poor forecasts when compared to the current industry practice which heavily relies on human judgment to factor in all types of information/events. The proposed model also outperforms sophisticated machine learning methods by mitigating the generation of extremely poor forecasts that drastically differ from actual sales due to changes in demand states. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Demand forecasting; Judgmental forecasting; Sales promotions; Supply chain; Systematic events; Time series regression models","Climate change; Forecasting; Machine learning; Sales; Supply chain management; Demand forecasting; Exogenous variables; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting models; Human intervention; Industry practices; Sophisticated machines; Statistical modeling; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092934974

Recent stringent UN and EU regulations promoting lower GWP refrigerants have been ratified to tackle the high carbon footprint of current refrigerants. This paper introduces a data-driven modelling framework for optimal investment strategies supporting the food retail industry to transition from hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigeration systems to lower GWP systems by 2030, in line with EU legislation. Representative data from a UK food retailer is applied in a mixed integer linear model, making simultaneous investment decisions across the property estate. The model considers refrigeration-system age, capacity, refrigerant type, leakage and past performance relative to peer systems in the rest of the estate. This study proposes two possible actions for high GWP HFC refrigeration systems: a) complying with legislation by retrofitting with an HFO blend (e.g. R449-A) or b) installing a new natural refrigerant system (e.g. R744). Findings indicate that a standard (i.e. business-as-usual) investment level of £6 m/yr drives a retrofitting strategy enabling significant reduction in annual carbon emissions of 71% by the end of 2030 (against the 2018 baseline), along with meeting regulatory compliance. The strategy is also highly effective at reducing emissions in the short term as total emissions during the 12-year programme are 59% lower than would have been experienced if the HFC emissions continued unabated. However, this spending level leaves the business at significant risk of refrigeration system failures as necessary investments in new systems are delayed resulting in an ageing, poorly performing estate. The model is further tested under different budget and policy scenarios and the financial, environmental, and business-risk implications are analysed. For example, under a more aggressive investment approach of £50 m/yr carbon reductions are at 93% by the end of 2030, whilst also ensuring compliance with the legislative cut-off four years early in 2026 and substantially enhancing the reliability of the refrigeration systems in the portfolio. Alternatively, when emissions are minimised instead of cost with a £50 m/yr investment level, 99% decarbonisation is achieved by 2030.

While past studies have proposed using Google Trends as an effective proxy for investor attention, we re-evaluate this idea in the context of a Granger causal framework. We apply the Kaplan–Meier estimator to quantify the level of persistence in lagged correlations between the search volume series and the directional movements in the S&P 500. We find that the directional movement of the S&P 500 from changes in the search volume series is dependent on the specific term being searched for, and by extension, the sentiment of the term itself. We hypothesize that while Google Trends is a valid measure of investor attention, the signals derived from changes in search volume is conditional upon the sentiment inherent to the search terms. Using the terms that are persistently found to be Granger causal with the index, we propose several generalized linear models for forecasting the probability of positive or negative directional movements, and propose a trade strategy from the generated forecasts, resulting in a 40% outperformance of a traditional buy-and-hold strategy in our testing period. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Forecasting; Google Trends; Investor attention; Stock market","capital flow; capital market; econometrics; Internet; investment; numerical model; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068878814

However, only a minority of young ventures actively engage in LD, and research rather focuses on large corporations and SMEs, which do not share the typical startup characteristics such as a rather young workforce, flat hierarchies, resource scarcity, and high time pressure. To overcome this practical and theoretical lack of knowledge, we engage in foresight and explore which leadership development techniques will be most relevant for startups within the next five to ten years. To formulate the most probable scenario, we conduct an international, two-stage Delphi study with 27 projections among industry experts. According to the expert panel, the majority of startups will engage in leadership development over the next decade. Most startups will aim to develop the leadership capabilities of their workforce as a whole and use external support. The most prominent prospective LD measures in startups include experiential learning methods, such as action learning, developmental job assignments, multi-rater feedback, as well as digital experiential learning programs, and developmental relationships such as coaching in digital one-to-one sessions.

With the presence of multiple alternatives, it is necessary to determine final products and production processes based on the evaluation. This study, thus, evaluates the product alternatives and production process alternatives, which are configured in the integrated configuration. In line with the fact that in practice, cost and time are two of the most important elements in quotation preparation, we develop evaluation models to minimize the production costs and completion time. In addition, to provide companies with better decision-making support in selecting product offerings, the proposed configuration evaluation computes the differences in terms of cost and time among all the product and production process alternatives.

This paper aims to explore how critical factors affect the effectiveness of horizontal and vertical CPKT and how to form the CPKT mechanism within PBOs. First, a theoretical model and 14 hypotheses were proposed based on the literature reviews and the pilot study carried out. Then, structural equation modeling (SEM) was done to examine the influencing factors and their relationships with the effectiveness of knowledge transfer according to the data collected from a survey questionnaire developed for this study. The results indicated that the project task context (i.e., temporary nature and time urgency) plays a negative role in the willingness to transfer knowledge. The organizational management context (i.e., organizational climate and incentive mechanism) promotes the increase of transfer intention, which further positively impacts the transfer effect. The trust relationship also has a positive effect on project teams' willingness to transfer knowledge. Additionally, the richness of transfer channels provides convenience for knowledge-exchange activities between projects, thus enhancing the effectiveness of CPKT. This research not only offers recommendations for project managers and company executives to promote CPKT within PBOs but also contributes to the development of a theoretical framework for knowledge-transfer theory. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction projects; Cross-project; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Project-based organizations","Surveys; Effectiveness of knowledge; Integrated frameworks; Knowledge transfer mechanisms; Organizational climate; Organizational management; Project-based organizations; Structural equation modeling; Theoretical framework; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091105320

As such, the goal of this paper is to evaluate and predict the hazard potential level of dams in the US using a comparative approach based on computational artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The research methodology comprised data collection from the National Inventory of Dams (NID); data preprocessing; data processing; and model selection and evaluation. To this end, the authors: (1) identified the best subset of variables that affect the prediction of the hazard potential level of dams in the US; (2) investigated the performance of two AI computational algorithms: artificial neural networks (ANNs) and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs) for the evaluation and prediction of the hazard potential levels of US dams; and (3) developed a decision support tool that could be used by the agencies responsible for the management of dams in the US with the capability to predict the hazard potential with good accuracy. The obtained results reflected that the ANN algorithm yielded better accuracy compared to the KNN algorithm. In addition, the conclusions indicated that 19 variables pertaining to dams in the US could affect the hazard potential level of dams. The output is a decision support system that is able to evaluate the hazard potential of dams with a prediction accuracy of 85.70%. This study contributes to the management in engineering's body of knowledge by devising a data-driven framework that is valuable for dams' owners and authorities. Ultimately, the developed computational AI algorithm could be used to evaluate and predict the hazard potential level of US dams with good accuracy while minimizing the efforts, time, and costs associated with formal inspection of the dams. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Artificial neural networks (ANNs); Computational algorithms; Decision support tool; Hazard potential; Infrastructure US dams; k -nearest neighbors (KNNs)","Dams; Data handling; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Comparative approach; Computational algorithm; Decision support tools; Environmental damage; Evaluation and predictions; K-nearest neighbors; Research methodologies; Hazards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087063720

Our empirical context is the U.S. defense industry, within which we study firms receiving defense-related Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards around September 11, 2001, an event which constituted an exogenous demand-side shock in which technology-related preferences of customers were reshuffled. We find that under demand-side change, preexisting customer relationships have a double-edged effect: They facilitate “extension-based” adaptation when interacted with technology capabilities experiencing a decline in customer preferences, and they hinder “novelty-based” adaptation when interacted with technology capabilities experiencing an increase in such preferences. We also find that both types of technological capabilities together facilitate adaptation along the extension and novelty paths. Managerial summary: Demand-side change, in which customer preferences for particular technologies are reshuffled, occurs in many industry settings. A deeper understanding of the factors shaping firm adaptation under this form of change can influence managers' decisions to implement strategies to plan for and react to such change. Using a sample of firms receiving defense-related SBIR awards around September 11, 2001, we show that the customer relationships a firm develops prior to demand-side change can have a double-edged effect on firm adaptation. Such relationships facilitate “extension-based” adaptation when combined with technology capabilities declining in customer preferences and hinder “novelty-based” adaptation when combined with technology capabilities increasing in customer preferences. In addition, the combination of the two technological capability types facilitates adaptation along both paths. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adaptation; capabilities; customer preferences; demand shock; SBIR","Managers; Network security; Public relations; Customer preferences; Customer relationships; Defense Industry; Demand-side; September 11; Small business innovation researches; Technological capability; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084441052

High-frequency updaters scored higher on crystallized intelligence and open-mindedness, accessed more information, and improved over time. Small-increment updaters had higher fluid intelligence scores, and derived their advantage from initial forecasts. Update magnitude mediated the causal effect of training on accuracy. Frequent, small revisions provided reliable and valid signals of skill.

As an unfortunate side effect for retailers, empirical findings demonstrate that lenient return policies lead some customers to abuse those return policies through opportunistic and even fraudulent behaviors. Customers can abuse return policies by making purchases with the full intention of returning the products or by returning a product long after extracting most of the product's market value. In doing so, abusive customers extract utility—physical, experiential, or financial—from these purchases, at little or no cost to themselves. However, retailers incur significant costs from such return abuse, with estimates topping $5.6 billion annually in the United States alone. Identifying customers who perpetrate return abuse remains a critical topic. Yet, as a construct, return abuse is difficult to define and to quantify. In contrast, legitimate returner and nonreturner customers exhibit different return behaviors with distinctly different transactional behaviors and profitability outcomes. To investigate these diverse returner behaviors, this study empirically analyzes a transactional secondary data set of over 1 million customers with over 75 million transactions from a national U.S.-based retailer. The analysis generates empirical insights that characterize observable customer actions related to abusive returners, legitimate returners, and nonreturners. This study introduces a set of predictive models that enable actionable managerial intervention and presents the opportunity to recapture significant returns costs that might otherwise be lost to avoidable return abuse. The analysis also highlights the need for a more holistic perspective toward predicting, managing, and preventing returns. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","consumer returns; predictive analytics; return abuse","Cost benefit analysis; Data Analytics; Predictive analytics; consumer returns; Empirical findings; Holistic perspectives; Market values; Predictive models; return abuse; Return policy; Secondary datum; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081742188

In this work, we propose a multiagent system to replicate the evolution of social bonds and online reviews in ORS. To validate the proposed method, we use big data from a real-world ORS collected over a period of 153 months. Results show that the proposed agent-based model can accurately predict the construction of bonds and the volumes of online reviews. Moreover, social moderation, economic moderation, and the combined moderating mechanism can motivate ORS members to post reviews. The stage (phase) of the review life cycle and the degree of moderation significantly impact the effectiveness of the mechanisms. Depending on the stage of the review life cycle, social and economic moderators have different degrees of success in generating online reviews. In the early stage, economic moderation is effective, whereas social moderation works better in the late stage. When the moderating levels are medium or high, the combined social and economic moderation is much better than the stand-alone mechanism.

The accuracy of the forecast is critical for RM systems to make appropriate recommendations to optimize revenue. Over recent years the industry has cited shifting booking windows due to a variety of macro (e.g., technology and economy) and micro (e.g., promotion) factors. These shifts pose challenges for RM forecasting algorithms particularly in the domain of pick-up based techniques. In this paper, we review the literature on hotel RM forecasting, particularly with respect to popular techniques used in practice. We then introduce a neural network approach to the advance booking environment to address issues related to booking window shifts. The models are estimated and tested for accuracy, and then re-tested years later after the booking window has shifted. The results are synthesized with discussion as to which models are more suitable for forecasting in dynamic booking windows. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Booking window; Forecasting; Hotels; Neural networks; Revenue management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086852854

Therefore, an understanding of factors that influence the development of hazard recognition skill among workers is fundamental to effective safety management. Based on social learning theory which suggests that individuals learn efficiently by observing, interacting, and emulating others in workplaces, the current article reports findings from a larger study that examined the effect of safety climate and social-network safety communication patterns on the hazard recognition skill demonstrated by workers. More specifically, building upon previously reported findings presented in Pandit et al. which suggests that maintaining a more positive safety climate can lead to superior hazard recognition levels, the current article presents additional results examining the effect of safety climate and social-network safety communication patterns—maintained by workers—on the demonstrated hazard recognition skill. The study involved recruiting construction crews from 57 projects in the United States where safety climate and social-network safety communication data were gathered using questionnaire surveys—which was then followed by a hazard recognition activity. The results suggest that, apart from the safety climate, social-network safety communication patterns are positively related to the demonstrated hazard recognition skill. In addition, evidence of an interaction effect was found—suggesting that establishing a positive safety climate and maintaining higher levels of safety communication can yield synergistic benefits. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","construction safety; occupational safety; safety climate; safety communication; safety culture; Safety management; social networks","Construction industry; Hazards; Human resource management; Social networking (online); Surveys; Construction safety; Occupational safety; Safety climate; Safety communications; Safety culture; Safety management; Occupational risks; communication; construction industry; social network; workplace; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078935959

However, it can also be associated with a range of positive, self-transcendent cognitive responses, such as a greater desire to help others, contribute to society, and make a more meaningful contribution in one's life and career. In this study, we provide evidence of a link between chief executive officer (CEO) mortality salience-triggered by the death of a director at the same firm-and a subsequent increase in firm-level prosocial behavior or corporate social responsibility (CSR). We further show that this core relationship is amplified in situations where the death of the director is likely to have been especially salient (i.e., the director was appointed within the CEO's tenure, or the death was sudden/expected).

However, the industry currently faces significant challenges that hinder the use of this technology. UAS operational procedure is disjointed with regard to the inspection decision-making process. Moreover, training those responsible for UAS operations requires a great deal of time and cost. This study documents the job responsibilities and establishes goals for UAS operators in the construction and infrastructure domains through the use of goal-directed cognitive task analysis (GCTA). GCTA has been proven essential to enhancing training efficiency by revealing necessary areas of augmentation of information requirements related to UAS operation, such as situation awareness and decision criteria. The main goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the task responsibilities and multilevel goals for operating a UAS. The findings of this study include three key personnel identified, their task domains, goals, and decision criteria, and situation awareness (SA) requirements. In the end, this study also instigates extensive discussion of the conceptual goal-directed decision-making process to support the realization of the goals of UAS applications.

Drawing on theories of inter-organizational partnerships, we examine the external determinants of size, mechanism, strength, and duration of the cooperative engagements, while controlling their innovative capacity, venture capital (VC) participation, and organizational size. We used mixed research methods to utilize both secondary and primary data, which were derived from the BvD Orbis database, to initially examine nanotech companies and then merged with our survey of 97 top executives and senior administrators of nanotech R&D projects across 12 European countries. Using multiple and logistic regression models, we show that a predictable legal system, a high level of tolerance for uncertainty, the prevalence of feminine values, geographical and functional nearness to key partners, high level of export demand for high-tech products, and periods of expansionary economic policies all simplify the complexities in the external environment of nanotech R&D projects.

The general business problem is some organizations in the grocery retail industry lack IWB to generate innovative solutions to remain competitive. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative method and a single case study design because the literature identified a need to understand how the leader–member relationships, employee engagement/job commitment and employee idea generation and implementation affect organizational innovation in the grocery retail industry. Using this method and design provided the appropriate approach to explore a single organization business process model for innovation. The three data sources for this study were semistructured one-on-one individual interviews, a single focus group and relevant organizational documentation. Findings: The findings showed high-quality relationships between knowledge workers and their leaders can positively affect their engagement/job commitment and ability to generate and implement useful ideas. A fundamental catalyst for IWB is when all four critical forces are in alignment including high-quality relationships between the knowledge workers and their leadership, the employee is fully engaged and the organization promotes risk-taking behavior to create new ideas with its commitment to innovation through resources and prioritization. The millennial participants indicated their leaders should be more transformational leaders coaching and mentoring them rather than transactional task-oriented disciplinarians. The Generation X and baby boomer participants were seeking more autonomy and resources to explore ideas. Research limitations/implications: Future researchers could consider exploring a deeper understanding of the multigenerational knowledge workers’ needs to help leaders stimulate employee engagement/job commitment and increase IWB. Practical implications: Organizations are able to meet the market demand for innovation and remain competitive. Social implications: Higher quality leader–member relationships lead to employee engagement/job commitment that can increase innovation.

In response, the authors argue that, from a theoretical standpoint, implementing BIM within professional work practices (as activity systems) induces their evolution through dysfunctions created within the systems and their resolution. Cases of professional organizations in South Africa that have implemented BIM within their organization and in multi-organizational projects helped to develop new theoretical insights into how professional work practices evolve using activity theory-based re-description of the data. Changes in professional work practices were analyzed sequentially within the framework, confirming theoretical propositions and revealing the dynamics between and within the interconnected system of actors, their object, tools, rules guiding work, roles they assume and the stakeholders. Essentially, the findings imply that the implementation of BIM significantly changes work practices within organizations, but gradually and over time. This supports an evolutionary, rather than a radical or revolutionary, view of BIM-induced change. This theoretical perspective could explain future dimensions of change in professional work practices involving BIM, and indeed similar work mediating tools. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activity theory; Building information modelling; collective work; social context; technological change; work practices","Activity coefficients; Professional aspects; Activity Theory; Building Information Modelling; collective work; Social context; Technological change; Work practices; Architectural design; computer simulation; holistic approach; numerical model; stakeholder; technological change; theoretical study; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061299610

Few studies have used existing data from past projects. This study presents a data-driven approach to evaluating contractors' production performance on past highway projects, a critical but rarely considered aspect of current evaluation systems. Using historical daily work report data, actual production rates were calculated for controlling activities in past projects. These rates were classified into three tiers of contractor production performance; four contractor-independent factors, which influence rates, location, project budget, weather, and quantity of work, were considered by applying classification techniques, distribution fitting, and Monte Carlo simulation. Performance indexes were proposed in order to enable comparisons. The proposed framework allows project owners to evaluate contractors more objectively and comprehensively by considering an additional but critical criterion in the existing evaluation process, that is, contractors' past production performance. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Contractor qualification; Daily work report; Monte Carlo simulation; Production rate; Project delivery method","Budget control; Decision making; Highway planning; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Project management; Classification technique; Contractor pre-qualification; Contractor qualification; Daily work reports; Data-driven approach; Production performance; Production rates; Project delivery method; Contractors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081637078

In addition, we used Random Under Sampling (RUS) to improve the performance of the model in predicting the minority group (no-show) patients. The patient-specific risk scores were justified by applying a threshold sensitivity analysis. Also, the web-based decision support tool that can be adopted by clinics is developed.

We compare findings with recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science research.

The maximum coverage location problem (MCLP), which is the basis of many sharing economy models, aims to cover more customers with a specified number of centers and radii. Many scholars have studied the MCLP Model from various angles and have achieved workload balance under maximum coverage by setting the upper limit of each center's workload. However, there has been little research involving the lower limit of the center. We propose a new MCLP model that includes a lower bound that would improve the quality of results. We also introduce the concept of “balance” that will reduce the imbalance of service levels at various locations. We call the proposed model balanced maximum coverage location problem (BMCLP). We test our model on the bike-sharing problem in a large Chinese city. Our results show the twin accomplishments of better maximal covering results and balanced service. We also show that our model is general enough to be applied to many sharing economy problems. In fact, for shared economic models, guaranteed services and balanced services are crucial for companies. Therefore, according to the basic theory of multiobjective optimization, a balanced maximal covering location problem (BMCLP) is proposed to determine a better design for maximal covering and balanced workload. Using the BMCLP Model successfully in a bike-sharing problem demonstrates that it is more general than the MCLP with demonstrated bounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bike-sharing; Iteration; MCLP; Mixed integer programming; Sharing economy","Bicycles; Economics; Location; Multiobjective optimization; Sustainable development; Bike-sharing; Iteration; MCLP; Mixed integer programming; Sharing economy; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073168918

However, existing techniques for evaluating completion risk remain incapable of identifying hidden patterns in risk behavior within large samples of projects, which are increasingly relevant for accurate prediction. To effectively tackle this problem in PPP projects, this study proposes a Big Data Analytics predictive modeling technique for completion risk prediction. With data from 4294 PPP project samples delivered across Europe between 1992 and 2015, a series of predictive models have been devised and evaluated using linear regression, regression trees, random forest, support vector machine, and deep neural network for completion risk prediction. Results and findings from this study reveal that random forest is an effective technique for predicting delays in PPP projects, with lower average test predicting error than other legacy regression techniques.

But identification of the specific levels of education and skills that contribute most to the development of absorptive capacity is often hampered by the use of skill measures as proxies for absorptive capacity itself. Drawing on a cross-country industry-level dataset, we retain separate measures of key components of absorptive capacity, namely, skills, R&D investments and openness to foreign trade and investment. We then estimate a system of structural equations in order to evaluate the extent to which different levels of skill contribute to innovative output (measured by growth in patenting) and subsequently to growth in productivity. We find important roles for both high-level skills and upper intermediate (technician-level) skills in converting the knowledge sourcing opportunities provided by openness into innovative output. In final stages of production (making use of innovative output), productivity growth in countries near to the technological frontier is enhanced not just by high-level and upper intermediate skills but also by the skills of the workforce as a whole. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","absorptive capacity; innovation; Productivity; skills",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065963792

Since accurate return forecasts are inputs into strategic and tactic decision support tools for operations managers, advancements in better forecast accuracy can yield significant savings from the returns management practice. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates transaction-level data, such as purchase and return timestamps, and predicts future return quantities using a two-step “predict-aggregate” process. To enhance the generalizability of our framework, we test it on two distinct datasets provided by a bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer and an online jewelry retailer. We find that our approach demonstrates significant forecasting error reduction, in the range of 10–20%, over benchmark models constructed from common industry practices and the existing literature. As our approach leverages the same data inputs as existing models, it can be easily adapted by practitioners. We also consider a number of extensions to generalize our approach into contexts such as restricted return time windows, new product returns, and inflated same-day returns.

However, little empirical evidence exists to support such a relationship. Inventory turnover is the ratio of sales to inventory, thus, the impact of product variety on both sales and inventory should be considered. Marketing literature indicates that increased product variety helps to increase sales, whereas operations management literature proposes that increased product variety leads to higher inventory levels due to a loss of risk pooling. Given that increased product variety leads to higher sales and higher inventory levels, the change in the ratio of sales to inventory (inventory turnover) in response to increased product variety is unclear theoretically and therefore more of an empirical question. In this study, we explore the impact of product variety on inventory turnover using a balanced panel data set. We find that, in general, product variety negatively affects inventory turnover, but this negative impact may disappear when demand variability is low. Our findings provide an explanation for the lack of conclusive empirical evidence supporting the negative influence of product variety on inventory turnover.

The dominant logic in this conversation frames a two-step process in which value is created by a firm before managers can distribute that value among the stakeholders. The stakeholder's power, or its ability to threaten the firm in some way, is commonly considered the primary factor in the second step value distribution process. However, we develop and test an argument that the ways managers engage with stakeholders to co-create value result in the stakeholder's strategic importance having more influence than power in the value distribution decision. The logic underlying this argument reverses the familiar two-step process so that it starts with value distribution. The implication is that firms arguably improve their overall performance by distributing more value to those stakeholders who are strategically important than to those stakeholders who exploit their bargaining power to threaten the firm.

However, much attention of the use of operational research and analytical models in healthcare has been paid to the systematic level such as country or regional policy making or organisational issues. This paper proposes a model concerned with healthcare analytics at the individual level, which can predict human physical activity status from sequential lifelogging data collected from wearable sensors. The model has a two-stage hybrid structure (in short, MOGP-HMM) – a multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) algorithm in the first stage to reduce the dimensions of lifelogging data and a hidden Markov model (HMM) in the second stage for activity status prediction over time. It can be used as a decision support tool to provide real-time monitoring, statistical analysis and personalized advice to individuals, encouraging positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles. We validate the model with the real data collected from a group of participants in the UK, and compare it with other popular two-stage hybrid models. Our experimental results show that the MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first study that uses the MOGP in the hybrid two-stage structure for individuals’ activity status prediction. It fits seamlessly with the current trend in the UK healthcare transformation of patient empowerment as well as contributing to a strategic development for more efficient and cost-effective provision of healthcare. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hidden Markov model; Machine learning; Multi-objective genetic programming; Physical activity status prediction","Binary alloys; Cost effectiveness; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Health care; Learning systems; Wearable technology; Decision support tools; Healthy lifestyles; Multi objective; Operational research; Patient empowerments; Physical activity; Real time monitoring; Strategic development; Hidden Markov models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067241558

A model of rational forward-looking consumers’ redemption behavior is derived that incorporates forgetting (to redeem) and stochastic redemption costs. Results show that when product price is exogenous, long-duration coupons may result in increased seller profits and always increase consumer surplus. Moreover, a one-period coupon is never optimal when (1) the difference in valuations for high-value (loyal) and low-value (non-loyal) consumers or (2) the coupon face value is larger than the redemption costs of high-value consumers. Long-duration coupons tend to be optimal when the level of recall of high-value consumers is sufficiently low, which reduces redemption by high-value consumers. Coupon duration together with face value plays an important role in coupons’ ability to price discriminate between different consumer segments and to avoid head-on competition with other sellers. Results can replicate empirically observed redemptions patterns, which has important implications for the strategic targeting of coupons to different consumer segments. A coupon may result in an increase or decrease in price. When the difference in valuation between high-value and low-value consumers is high (relative to the redemption costs), a seller can either reduce price and lower face value or increase coupon duration for the purpose of avoiding redemption by high-value consumers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","(D) Analytics; (D) Behavioral OR; (D) OR in marketing; (D) Pricing; (O) Retailing","Costs; Product design; Profitability; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; (D) Analytics; (D) Behavioral OR; Consumer segments; Consumer surplus; Forward looking; Joint optimization; Long duration; Product price; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071469693

Building on theory about choice-supportive bias and escalation of commitment, we theorize that “hiring directors” (directors who were present during a CEO's hiring) will display choice-supportive bias and escalate commitment to poorly performing CEOs. Primary data from 73 directors indicate that directors are indeed biased toward CEOs they help hire. Archival data from S&P 1500 firms reveal that, following poor performance, the number of hiring directors is positively related to the increase in CEO pay and lower likelihood of CEO dismissal. Building on theory about board experience, we also predict and find that more experienced boards reduce the tendency to escalate. Thus, bias among hiring directors can be mitigated via experience. Managerial Summary: Making a choice such as casting a vote or selecting a restaurant leads people to view their selection favorably even if evidence emerges suggesting it was a bad choice. We examine whether corporate directors fall prey to this choice-supportive bias when involved in CEO hiring. We found that directors who are part of the hiring process tend to have an overly rosy view of the person selected. Moreover, if the firm is performing poorly, a board with more directors who helped hire the current CEO will tend to increase the CEO's pay more and are less likely to fire the CEO than a board with fewer such directors. This problem is reduced if the board has highly experienced directors among its ranks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","board of directors; CEO compensation; CEO dismissal; cognitive bias; corporate governance","Management; Planning; Board of directors; CEO compensations; CEO dismissal; Cognitive bias; Corporate governance; Employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074063455

We are working towards an increased commitment towards resource efficiency in the built environment and to the growth of innovative businesses following circular economy principles. The conceptualization of change is a relevant part of energy and sustainability transitions research, which is aimed at enabling radical shifts compatible with societal functions. In this framework, building performance has to be considered in a whole life cycle perspective because buildings are long-term assets. In a life cycle perspective, both operational and embodied energy and carbon emissions have to be considered for appropriate comparability and decision-making. The application of sustainability assessments of products and practices in the built environment is itself a critical and debatable issue. For this reason, the way energy consumption data are measured, processed, and reported has to be progressively standardized in order to enable transparency and consistency of methods at multiple scales (from single buildings up to building stock) and levels of analysis (from individual components up to systems), ideally complementing ongoing research initiatives that use open science principles in energy research. In this paper, we analyse the topic of linking design and operation phase’s energy performance analysis through regression-based approaches in buildings, highlighting the hierarchical nature of building energy modelling data. The goal of this research is to review the current state of the art of in order to orient future efforts towards integrated data analysis workflows, from design to operation. In this sense, we show how data analysis techniques can be used to evaluate the impact of both technical and human factors. Finally, we indicate how approximated physical interpretation of regression models can help in developing data-driven models that could enhance the possibility of learning from feedback and reconstructing building stock data at multiple levels. © 2020 Manfren, Nastasi and Tronchin.","Building energy performance; Data-driven methods; Multivariate regression; Open energy data; Open software","Artificial life; Buildings; Construction industry; Data handling; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Information analysis; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Building energy modelling; Data analysis techniques; Energy consumption datum; Individual components; Life cycle perspectives; Physical interpretation; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability transition; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097281466

Bauer College of Business, University of Houston, Houston, TX  77204, United States","Despite massive investments in transportation infrastructure, traffic congestion remains a major societal and public policy problem. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have been proposed as a potential solution to this challenge, but their effectiveness has remained unclear in both research and practice. To understand whether and how ITS affect traffic congestion, we consolidate a unique longitudinal data set on road traffic and the deployment of a large federally supported ITS program in the United States-511 systems-in 99 urban areas between 1994 and 2014. The difference-in-differences estimates show that the adoption of 511 systems is associated with a significant decrease in traffic congestion, saving over $4.7 billion dollars and 175 million hours in travel time annually in U.S. cities. 511 systems also reduce about 53 million gallons of fossil fuel consumption and over 10 billion pounds of CO2 emissions. We offer two theoretical explanations for this effect: (i) ITS help individual commuters to make better travel decisions, and (ii) ITS help local governments to develop an urban traffic management capability. Empirical evidence supports the underlying theoretical mechanisms and shows that ITS help commuters to schedule travel more efficiently, choose better navigation routes, and optimize their worktrip transportation mode. Second, the effect of ITS is contingent on road supply and public transit services. We also find that the traffic-reducing effect of ITS is larger when commuters use more online services for traffic information and when state governments incorporate more functionalities into their 511 systems.

By contrast, organ donation has been little explored. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious model of organ donation to analyze the welfare consequences of introducing the donor-priority rule, which grants registered organ donors priority in receiving organs should they need transplants in the future. We model an individual's decision to join the donor registry, which entails a trade-off between abundance of supply, exclusivity of priority, and cost of donating (e.g., psychological burden). Assuming heterogeneity in the cost of donating only, we find the introduction of the donor-priority rule leads to improved social welfare. By incorporating heterogeneity in the likelihood of requiring an organ transplant and in organ quality, we show that, in contrast to the literature, introducing the donor-priority rule can lower social welfare because of unbalanced incentives across different types of individuals. In view of the potentially undesirable social-welfare consequences, we consider a freeze-period remedy, under which an individual is not entitled to a higher queueing priority until after having been on the organ-donor registry for a specified period of time. We show this additional market friction helps rebalance the incentive structure, and in conjunction with the donor-priority rule, can guarantee an increase in social welfare by boosting organ supply without compromising organ quality or inducing excessively high costs of donating. © 2019 INFORMS.","Donor-priority rule; Health policy; Organ donation; Organ transplantation; Queueing games","Management; Operations research; Transplantation (surgical); Health policy; Incentive structure; Organ donations; Organ transplants; Parsimonious modeling; Priority rules; Queueing games; Queueing priority; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080085317

Past work has directed attention to the antecedents of misconduct while largely overlooking this question. The relatively few studies that examined it have typically revolved around agency arguments. This study instead examines how the beliefs and values held by board members can influence their actions following financial misconduct. Focusing on political ideology, we argue that politically conservative boards are more likely to respond by dismissing the CEO than are liberal boards as the result of ideo-attribution and threat management tendencies. Using data from S&P 1500 firms that were involved with financial misconduct, we find support for our arguments while addressing sample-induced endogeneity and alternative explanations with additional analyses. Managerial Summary: Despite criticism from stakeholders, the public, media, and policy makers, many firms do not take serious action against CEOs who have committed financial misconduct. Past studies have suggested that this is due to board structures (e.g., lack of board independence) or situations surrounding misconduct (e.g., severity of misconduct). We propose that political ideology, a set of beliefs and values, held by board members, influences whether firms dismiss their CEOs following financial misconduct. Examining S&P 1500 firms that were involved in financial misconduct, we find that politically conservative boards tend to dismiss their CEOs more often than do liberal boards, offering practical implications for how the ideology of board members can influence critical actions that they take. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CEO dismissal; corporate governance; financial misrepresentation; organizational misconduct; political ideology","Management; Planning; CEO dismissal; Corporate governance; financial misrepresentation; organizational misconduct; Political ideologies; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074053558

We propose two different dimensions of service mix, with the first dimension capturing internal emphasis on specific service lines (i.e., specialization) and the second dimension reflecting the deviation of a hospital from the average level of specialization for hospitals in the same service area (i.e., differentiation). We hypothesize that as the level of a hospital's specialization increases, hospital cost efficiency should improve at a decreasing rate. We also hypothesize that differentiation helps improve cost efficiency in competitive markets.

Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","healthcare cost; medical error; operational failures; survey; workarounds","Health risks; Nursing; Surveying; Surveys; Health care costs; Health care providers; Hospital costs; Medical errors; Operational failures; Patient health; Quality of care; workarounds; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063495276

In contrast to the current practice of showing plots of predicted values, binned scatterplots graph the nonparametric relationship between two variables, either unconditionally or conditional on a set of controls, for multiple subgroups. This allows researchers to quickly detect the shape of that relationship, examine outliers, and assess which part of the support may be driving a relationship. We propose that the adoption of binned scatterplots will lead to the identification of new and interesting phenomena, raise the credibility of empirical research, and help create richer theories. Managerial Summary: Regression analysis often assumes linear or quadratic relationship forms between two variables. We seek to diffuse a graphical tool—binned scatterplots—that allow the researcher and reader to evaluate whether such assumptions are maintained throughout the data. For example, binned scatterplots may clarify that a regression relationship is nonlinear, or driven by an exceptional firm or a small set of firms. We propose that using binned scatterplots will improve the transparency and quality of empirical work, as well as aid in the development of new phenomena and enhance theory development. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","binned scatterplots; data visualization; graphical analysis; least squares regression; nonparametric analysis","Management; Planning; Current practices; Empirical research; Graphical tools; Non-parametric; Regression relationship; Scatter plots; Strategic management; Theory development; Regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087734817

Prior studies primarily focused on reducing risk through reinforcement of supply-side reliability. However, during or after a disaster, electricity demand is likely to vary (e.g., electricity use may increase for disaster relief supply production or decrease because of governmental energy conservation policies). This study examined the impact of demand-side responses from industrial, commercial, and residential sectors on the performance of the power grid when supply shortages occur after earthquakes. Electricity supply and demand in the context of seismic hazards were modeled based on the system dynamics approach, and the model was tested with seismic hazards that occurred in South Korea in 2016. The simulation results showed that without supply growth after seismic hazards, the blackout decreased as much as 6.7% of daily electricity use in the case region when commercial and residential sectors give positive aid for participating in mandatory or voluntary demand control, or both. This finding demonstrates the critical role of demand-side management, which can regulate electricity consumption to improve community resilience. The outcomes of this research have the potential to support governmental policymaking to determine optimal values of generation capacity expansion, load shedding, and voluntary savings to prevent supply shortages and oversupply. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Community resilience; Demand-side responses; Power grid reliability; Seismic hazards; System dynamics","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Economics; Electric load shedding; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Hazards; Housing; Seismic response; Community resiliences; Demand side response; Electricity supply and demands; Electricity-consumption; Generation capacity; Governmental energy; Residential sectors; System dynamics approach; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088124913

In this research, we identify that the classical theory of value of information has weaknesses related with optimal data acquisition selection, data fuzziness and fuzzy decision criteria and we propose a modification in the theory to fill the gaps found. The research presented in this paper integrates theories and techniques from statistical analysis and artificial intelligence to develop a more coherent, robust and complete methodology for assessing the value of acquiring new information in the context of the oil and gas industry. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study describing a value of information assessment in an oil field where two alternatives for data acquisition are discussed. It is shown that: I) the technique of design of experiments provides a full identification of the input parameters affecting the value of the project and allows a proper selection of the data acquisition actions, ii) when the fuzziness of the data is included in the assessment, the value of the data decreases compared with the case where data are assumed to be crisp; this result means that the decision concerning the value of acquiring new data depends on whether the fuzzy nature of the data is included in the assessment and on the difference between the project value with and without data acquisition, iii) the fuzzy inference system developed for this case study successfully follows the logic of the decision-maker and results in a straightforward system to aggregate decision criteria. © 2020 Regional Association for Security and crisis management.

We also find that large and complex firms receiving greater media attention engage more in IR activities. In addition, firms domiciled in countries with weaker legal protections for investors and poorer disclosure standards, those cross-listed in the stock markets that are outperforming, and those with high global media visibility invest in greater global outreach efforts with IR activities.

There is limited understanding of how different drivers relate to different reshoring decisions. There has been little examination of purchasing's role in reshoring decision-making. Through 25 case studies of reshoring decisions taken by 18 companies, this research examines the relationship between different drivers and the type of reshoring decision taken, and how purchasing was involved at different stages of the reshoring decision-making process. The findings reveal four types of reshoring; most companies made mono-dimensional reshoring decisions, and three types of mono-dimensional decisions were found. One type of bi-dimensional reshoring initiatives involved changed location and ownership. The most common drivers for reshoring were operational reasons and brand reputation, as reasons for the original offshoring decision had changed over time. Four types of involvement of purchasing in different stages of reshoring decisions were found: no involvement, operational involvement in implementation, early involvement in feasibility studies, and strategic involvement throughout the whole process. Different types of purchasing involvement were found to relate to different types of reshoring with particularly strong involvement in bi-dimensional reshoring decisions. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decision analysis; purchasing; reshoring decisions; reshoring drivers","Decision theory; Purchasing; Sales; Brand reputation; Business practices; Common drivers; Decision making process; Different stages; Early involvement; Feasibility studies; reshoring decisions; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073774211

Developing detailed measures of internal capabilities at a large scale, however, is often hampered by limitations in the availability of data from conventional sources, low survey response rates and panel attrition. The emergence of new information sources, including big data sets derived from the online activities of firms, coupled with advanced computational approaches, raises fresh analytical possibilities. In this exploratory study, we turn to freely accessible website data to gauge internal capabilities, specifically for market sensing and responding. To operationalize the construct of seizing, the paper uses an application of topic modeling, a text mining approach commonly used in computer science, on archived website data from the Wayback Machine for two time periods, 2008–2009 and 2010–2011, to explain sales growth for green goods enterprises in two later time periods, from 2010 to 2012. We find an endogenous inverse U-shaped relationship exists between market seizing and sales growth. Increasing levels of focus on a firm’s local geographic area also predict sales growth. We consider these findings in light of the practitioner literature on firm agility and pivoting and discuss opportunities for future work using website data to study entrepreneurship and the strategic management of innovation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Dynamic capabilities; Entrepreneurship; SMEs; Text mining; Website analytics","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data mining; Enterprise resource management; Green computing; Sales; Strategic planning; Surveys; Websites; Computational approach; Dynamic capabilities; Entrepreneurship; Exploratory studies; Information sources; SMEs; Strategic management; Text mining; Industrial management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071493847

Considering the main reasons behind the lack of social responsibilities of multinational corporations, this work develops a model with punishment. Based on this model, we obtain the optimal decision for the supply-chain members under either decentralized decision-making or centralized decision-making. And we analyze whether the penalty rate will have an impact on the input of corporate social responsibility and how it will affect the self-interests of supply chain members. Ultimately, by exploring the decision variables of companies that practice stronger corporate social responsibility, we compare and analyze our models to draw several interesting and practically useful conclusions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Double standard; Game theory; Punishment; Transnational corporation","corporate social responsibility; decision making; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085392235

Whilst these multiteam systems provide potential access to a wide pool of knowledge and resources, public inquiries repeatedly highlight coordination difficulties, leading to conflicting decisions and actions. However, limited research has focused on examining the inter-team processes used to coordinate decisions in situ within extreme environments in order to cross-validate theory. Accordingly, the following study analyses naturalistic observations conducted during two large-scale live disaster response exercises in order to examine (1) what inter-team processes are used to coordinate decisions, and (2) the extent to which they correspond with a linear phase-based ‘Joint Decision Model’ (JDM) introduced to national UK disaster response guidance. Findings show responders frequently either revert to gathering information rather than progressing to take action, or take action without deliberately considering options, powers, and policies to form a plan. These non-linear decision processes remain largely similar across both exercises, indicating that the initial implementation of national JDM guidance has not yet led to substantial changes. Further focus is needed to identify mechanisms for improving coordination in practice, including the form and frequency of training required to maintain such complex skills. Practitioner points: Difficulties coordinating information, decisions, and actions are repeatedly identified in multiteam systems operating in extreme environments. Limited research has focused on examining inter-team processes used to coordinate decisions in situ within extreme environments, posing implications for developing targeted interventions. Findings highlight a tendency for multiagency discussions to either revert back to information gathering rather than progressing to form and implement plans, or moving straight from information gathering to implementing decisions without consciously forming plans. Strong leadership is vital for steering multiagency meetings but chairing these complex discussions is a cognitively demanding task. © 2020 The Authors.

In this context, this paper considers Intellectual Property Management (IPM) efficiency based on the Patent Portfolio Model (PPM) to help organizations identify, enhance, and evaluate their technological strength. The Patent Portfolio Model (PPM) is built to assess the advantages and disadvantages of an organization, to identify the opportunities of development potentials and optimal distribution, to support the decision-making for optimizing resource allocation, and to develop a layout for the technical field. The case study of the Research Institute of China shows that this method is feasible and fulfills the needs of different institutions to provide suggestions for R&D technology management. The main finding of the paper is that PPM is an effective tool to be used in strategic planning because it identifies the technology advantages to define offensive and defensive strategies against competitors. The use of IPM and PPM helps decision-makers to visualize and simplify complex decision-making problems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"Decision making; Economics; Defensive strategies; Development potential; Intellectual property management; Optimal distributions; Research institutes; Technological innovation; Technological strength; Technology development; Patents and inventions; decision making; innovation; intellectual property rights; measurement method; planning method; research and development; resource allocation; strategic approach; technological development; technology adoption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085240467

If the first-period sales volume is disclosed, the second-period customers will base their purchase decisions on this information. If the sales volume is not disclosed, all customers will make purchase decisions based on their estimate of market size. We identify two countervailing effects of sales disclosure: (1) a prodisclosure “Matthew effect” (the benefit of a realized large market size tends to outweigh the loss of a realized small one) and (2) an antidisclosure saturation effect (for a sufficiently large market, customers would make a purchase anyway even without knowing the realized market size but might be discouraged if observing a realized small one). With exogenous prices, we show that committing to sales disclosure is a dominating (dominated) policy when the expected network benefit is relatively weak (strong). We also examine three endogenous pricing scenarios. First, under state-independent pricing, committing to sales disclosure is better off if the customer valuation distribution has a high probability of reaching very high values (i.e., a heavy tail). Second, if a firm can credibly preannounce a contingent pricing policy, committing to sales disclosure is always better off. Third, under contingent pricing without commitment, we show that committing to sales disclosure is better off when delaying the purchase decision to the second period does not reduce the value much. © 2020 INFORMS","Information disclosure; Network effects; Pricing; Sales information","Commerce; Costs; Probability distributions; Customer valuation; Forward-looking customers; High probability; Information disclosure; Matthew effects; Pricing policy; Purchase decision; Saturation effects; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091093267

These “scarcity” messages provide consumers “partial” inventory information, revealing only an upper bound on the number of units available for sale. To examine the impact of these messages, we obtained price and sales data from an online-retailer website across a sample of durable goods before and after the retailer posted the messages over multiple inventory-replenishment cycles. We then used these data to assess empirically the effect of these messages on these products' daily sales. We find that disclosing these messages can decrease daily sales by an average of 17.60%. This finding suggests that scarcity messages such as these can have a negative influence on the sales prospects of durable goods. We also observe, on the other hand, that price discounts are quite effective in increasing sales and offsetting the losses induced by scarcity messages. On average, a reduction of 1% in stock keeping unit price increases daily sales by approximately 3%. Therefore, relative to disclosing scarcity messages, price discounts are a much more effective tool at increasing inventory turns. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","econometrics; inventory management; online retailing; operations management-marketing interface","Electronic commerce; Inventory control; Statistics; econometrics; Inventory information; Inventory management; Inventory replenishment; Inventory turns; Online retailing; Operations management; Stock keeping unit; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079731284

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this aim, the study uses a 20-year time series analysis (1996–2015) and tests the effect of entrepreneurship on economic growth, through public governance, via a mediator model. Findings: The study has determined that public governance buoys the positive effect that entrepreneurship activities exert on economic growth in the UAE. Based on this determination, the study posits a set of recommendations that focus on supporting entrepreneurship activities that play a significant role in economic growth. Originality/value: The study adds to the literature on the impact of entrepreneurship on economies dependent on oil revenues vis-à-vis a public policy perspective. The study provides insights into the type of entrepreneurship that most efficaciously suits the Emirati social and cultural milieu in terms of fostering national economic growth. In addition, the study limns a vision of the role of public governance in creating an enabling environment that stimulates entrepreneurial activity and, in turn, increases economic growth in the Emirates. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Entrepreneurship; Mediation model; Public governance; United Arab Emirates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077595101

The paper applies fixed-effects techniques to a novel dataset that merges several waves of Chile's National Manufacturing Surveys collected by the National Institute of Statistics with register data on the beneficiaries of both programs. The results suggest that while both programs have had a positive impact on participants’ productivity, only FONDEF-funded projects have generated positive spillovers on firms’ productivity. The analysis reveals that the spillover effects on productivity display an inverted-U relationship with the intensity of public support.

The study's findings, derived by applying the critical incidence methodology to a heterogeneous dataset of buying agents (n > 200) representing small and medium enterprises and acting as key informants on salespeople, show that: (i) salesperson influence tactics heterogeneously explain the buying agent's trust of the salesperson, (ii) trust of the salesperson serves as a mechanism through which influence tactics impact the buying agent's purchase decision, (iii) buying agent's regulatory orientation moderates the relationship between salesperson influence tactics and buying agent's trust of the salesperson, and (iv) salesperson regulatory orientation predicts a salesperson's use of particular influence tactics.

Buyers often conduct quality inspection on shipments and frame supply contracts to punish quality fraud. Due to cost concerns, buyers need to estimate the suppliers’ fraud possibilities and choose appropriate testing methods and frequencies. As suppliers’ fraud intentions depend on their cost-benefit analysis, it is possible to analyze suppliers’ fraud intention with appropriate modeling of their profit-seeking behavior. In this research, we are interested in how fraud intention analysis may affect the quality inspection process. It should be noted that quality inspection can be a repeated process, with suppliers and buyers conducting multiple rounds of transactions (including transactions with frauds) and learning about each other during the process. Their supply contracts may also affect suppliers’ profit-seeking attitude. We conduct a laboratory experiment to examine the effect of fraud intention analysis systems on inspection decision making considering the learning and contract effects. We put the experiment in the context of a dairy supply chain as a critical and interesting example application. The experiment shows that if there are no strong punitive terms for fraud in the contract, fraud intention analysis can improve buyers’ decision-making efficiency after controlling the learning effect, in terms of decision time, inspection cost, and correctness of rejecting suppliers’ fraudulent shipments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deception detection; Decision support; Fraud intention analysis; Laboratory experiment; Learning; Supply chain quality inspection; Supply contract","Crime; Decision making; Decision support systems; Inspection; Learning systems; Profitability; Sales; Ships; Supply chains; Testing; Deception detection; Decision supports; Fraud intention analysis; Laboratory experiments; Learning; Quality inspection; Supply contracts; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068468894

Although this is still true, the manslaughter convictions of six earthquake scientists and one public official for failed risk communication in 2009 served as a catalyst for expanding these goals to also intentionally examine the challenges of communicating earthquake risk with non-scientific during the pre-crisis stage of the earthquake lifecycle. The Crisis Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) Model developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides specific guidelines for doing so. Thus, based on a thematic analysis of interviews with 21 earthquake scientists, this study identifies what those responsible for communicating regularly about earthquake risk see as major communication challenges and the extent to which the CERC model recommendations are useful for addressing them. Results suggest that earthquake risk science communicators are most effective when they translate scientific and technical information simply, respond to competing messages, capitalize on relevant popular culture references, employ risk communication campaigns during ‘quiet periods’, and acknowledge uncertainty. These findings have implications not only for earthquake science risk communicators, but also for expanding the pre-crisis stage best practices proposed in the Crisis Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model. Essentially, this study reveals that soliciting and responding to feedback in the pre-crisis stage could help spokespersons clarify or correct any messages that are perceived by audiences as unclear or are simply not accurate. Doing so may improve risk communication effectiveness not only during the pre-crisis stage but also throughout the earthquake crisis lifecycle. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crisis communication; earthquake early warning; earthquake forecasting; emergency response; Risk communication","Disease control; Earthquakes; Life cycle; Risk assessment; Crisis communications; Earthquake early warning; Earthquake forecasting; Emergency response; Risk communication; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061444863

The use of advanced technologies has resulted in safer jobsites hosting more productive project teams building more sustainable and resilient facilities and infrastructure. Recently, the innovative use of data and analytical approaches has had a major positive effect on a variety of businesses by incorporating data-driven applications and approaches. However, the AEC/FM industry is still lagging behind many other industries in leveraging the true power of data. Data analytics concepts and tools integrated with emerging construction trends such as building information modeling (BIM) have a high potential to revolutionize industry practices. This paper consolidates the record of current efforts in the AEC/FM body of knowledge (BOK) and body of practice (BOP) that incorporate the use of Data Analytics with common Technology Trends in various Application Areas. Identifying common subsections of each category, a three dimensional evidenced taxonomy was developed that maps (1) Data Analytics concepts such as cloud computing and machine learning onto, (2) AEC/FM emerging trends such as BIM and automation, and (3) existing and potential AEC/FM applications such as safety and progress monitoring. To further expand the validity of the results and explore opportunities and potential, a survey with the same categorization was developed and distributed among industry experts. Comparing the results of the exploration of the BOK and the survey illustrated the popularity of BIM among industry practitioners and in academic research. Also, process efficiency and productivity improvement were the two Application Areas that demonstrated the most potential to benefit from the integration of Data Analytics and Technology Trends. Analysis of the survey results indicated that, with a 95% confidence level, there is no statistically significant difference among the Technology Trends or Application Areas, as identified in the literature, that can benefit from Data Analytics. The results presented in this study demonstrate evidence of the revolutionizing power of Data Analytics in the AEC/FM industry. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Architectural design; Information management; Information theory; Office buildings; Productivity; Surveys; Advanced technology; Analytical approach; Building Information Model - BIM; Data-driven applications; Information Modeling; Productivity improvements; Statistically significant difference; Technological advancement; Data Analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077984332

Productive land attracted colonization, which disrupted Indigenous institutions in ways that can stunt development. American Indian reservations provide a powerful example. Where land quality was high, the federal government facilitated land titling and non-Indian settlement through the General Allotment Act of 1887. The evidence suggests this process caused a U-shaped relationship between American Indian per capita income over 1970 to 2010 and a reservation's share of prime agricultural land, in contrast to a positive relationship across U.S. counties. The downward slope of the U is due to land ownership fractionation that disproportionately affected reservations with mid-quality land and now requires federal administration. After controlling for fractionation, the effect of prime land is positive, implying land quality has indirectly suppressed income growth through its effects on land rights. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"agricultural land; economic development; economic growth; federal system; indigenous population; land rights; landownership; poverty determinant; power relations; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077439721

Subsequently, we examined the Moran's-I test in the OLS models and estimated spatial autocorrelation (SAR) models and spatial error model (SEM) in order to include the spatial correlation effect on the estimate models. Through these estimations, we found that the religious factors, such as whether OIC or non-OIC, religious diversity and Muslim population, have obvious effects on determination of financial inclusion. In addition, we also verified social inequality factors, such as gender inequality, education level and social opportunity level, work as determinants of financial inclusion.

Using a rich panel of Medicare claims data for nearly one million dialysis patients, we advance the literature on the effects of mergers and acquisitions by studying the precise ways providers change their behavior following an acquisition. We base our empirical analysis on more than 1,200 acquisitions of independent dialysis facilities by large chains over a 12-year period and find that chains transfer several prominent strategies to the facilities they acquire. Most notably, acquired facilities converge to the behavior of their new parent companies by increasing patients' doses of highly reimbursed drugs, replacing high-skill nurses with less-skilled technicians, and waitlisting fewer patients for kidney transplants. We then show that patients fare worse as a result of these changes: outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality deteriorate, with our long panel allowing us to identify these effects from within-facility or within-patient variation around the acquisitions. Because overall Medicare spending increases at acquired facilities, mostly as a result of higher drug reimbursements, this decline in quality corresponds to a decline in value for payers. We conclude the article by considering the channels through which acquisitions produce such large changes in provider behavior and outcomes, finding that increased market power cannot explain the decline in quality. Rather, the adoption of the acquiring firm's strategies and practices drives our main results, with greater economies of scale for drug purchasing responsible for more than half of the change in profits following an acquisition. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"firm ownership; health care; merger; panel data; performance assessment; profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082038200

What emerges from the analysis of public documents, reports and policy briefs is that intensity indicators are often framed uncritically and unreflectively. Our analysis highlights three fundamental themes that emerge from public debates around intensity indicator. First, ‘efficiency’ and ‘intensity’ – often framed in terms of productivity – are used equivalently. Second, intensity is perceived as a measure of win-win sustainability in which economic growth can be decoupled from energy consumption without a substantial restructuring of the productive system. Third, the analysis suggests that energy and carbon intensity indicators are attractive for policy makers – especially in the so-called developing world – because they can be used to design political targets (e.g. Paris agreement) without questioning the right to economic growth of powerful emerging economies like the BRICS. The paper shows the strong limitations of intensity indicators and their potential do misguide policymakers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon intensity; Energy efficiency; Energy intensity; Energy productivity; Policy; Think tanks","Carbon; Decision making; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Productivity; Public policy; Tanks (containers); Carbon intensity; Developing world; Emerging economies; Energy intensity; Energy productivity; Intensity indicators; Productive systems; Think tanks; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072701624

We call on operations management scholars to broaden and increase their use of empirical tools as a vital source of new knowledge creation; and we highlight the benefits of filling methodological gaps, especially in case and survey research. Drawing on the dynamics associated with paradigm shifts, we offer a new research paradigm that we term combinative research value, in which these two empirical techniques, coupled with other approaches (e.g., web scraping, analyses of big data, and/or analytic modeling), can help accelerate our understanding of changing operating strategies and practices.

This study focuses on the Canadian life insurance sector, which is the second largest and oldest financial services sector in Canada. Using an empirical framework that incorporates both fixed and dynamic panel models that control for endogeneity issues, this research finds that size, liquidity, and risk exposure of life insurers are significant factors in their profitability. Secondly, industry concentration (e.g., HHI) fail to provide any meaningful evidence to support the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) theory in the static panel models, but in the dynamic models, industry concentration tends to have negative impacts on profitability. Macroeconomic factors such as real GDP growth and equity market returns are found to be significant determinants of insurers’ profitability.

To address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood crime statistics affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support patient prioritization in a pilot behavioural intervention and will inform appointment planning decisions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Design science research; Healthcare access; No-show prediction","Backpropagation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Medical problems; Multilayer neural networks; Probability; Public policy; Regression analysis; Decision making process; Decision support system (dss); Machine learning approaches; Multiple regression model; Neural network predictions; Policy implications; Resource allocation policy; Variable interaction; Patient treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089896434

Four types of supply chain coordination contract are developed and benchmarked against set performance indices employing sensitivity analysis and non-linear optimization techniques. Nash ‘static’ and Stackelberg ‘dynamic’ models are employed to represent the ‘gameplay’ between the ‘manufacturer’ and ‘retailer’ in a supply chain. The key inputs are average demand and ‘forced labour’ ratios, whereas key performance indicators are advertising, inventory and pricing costs. Our results indicate that by reducing the proportion of ‘forced labour’ for both members of the supply chain, the overall profitability increases in a Nash static gaming context. However, the contractual relationships in a Stackelberg dynamic situation provide a different picture. Here, if the ‘retailer’ assumes the leadership role, cost-sharing contracts increase the profitability for both partners. However, if the ‘manufacturer’ assumes the leader, the profit-sharing contract leads to the highest overall profit. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms that an ideal situation is one in which the ‘forced labour’ ratio approaches ‘zero’, where the profitability of the retailer is usually higher than that of the manufacturer. Previous researchers have used ‘survey-based’ methods to develop proportional or ‘mediating’ relationships to measure the impact of CSR on supply chain profitability. This paper addresses the associated gap by providing a game theoretic-based non-linear mathematical model to assess the direct impact of negative CSR on supply chain profitability and benchmarks the performance of different supply chain contracts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Game theory; Nash and Stackelberg equilibrium; Supply chain coordination","Benchmarking; Cost effectiveness; Game theory; International law; Manufacture; Nonlinear programming; Profitability; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Wages; Contractual relationships; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Cost sharing contracts; Key performance indicators; Non-linear optimization; Profit-sharing contracts; Supply chain contracts; Supply chain coordination; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088230747

Many companies today are creating incentive compensation contracts to reward hard-working employees for jobs done well. Profit sharing (""sharing compensation contract"") and target with bonus (""target compensation contract"") are two common performance-based compensation contracts prevalent in business. We theoretically and behaviorally study the sharing and target compensation contracts in an operational context where a firm sets the parameters of the compensation contracts and a store manager, after observing the compensation contract offered to him, chooses his effort level (unobservable by the firm) and makes ordering decisions for the store. Our experimental data suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal behavioral promise and pitfalls under the two compensation contracts. In particular, the store manager is more willing to exert high effort under the target contract all else being equal. However, the store manager is also more likely to punish the firm for perceived ""unfair""offers by submitting an extremely low order quantity. We find that bounded rationality plays an important role in driving a higher effort rate under the target contract than the sharing contract. We introduce a new formulation of the fairness concerns, which is referred to as by-state fairness, where individuals, rather than considering whether the expected profits received are fair, consider the fairness in the potential realized outcomes. This new formulation explains why managers are more likely to order very little to punish the firm under the target contract. In addition, we conduct validation experiments to verify our behavioral explanation. © 2020 INFORMS.","Behavioral operations; Compensation contract; Fairness; Operations and marketing interface; Quantal response equilibrium; Sales effort","Profitability; Wages; Bounded rationality; Compensation contract; Compensation systems; Fairness concerns; Incentive compensation; Performance based; Sharing contracts; Systematic deviation; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092348876

We examine how profits, technology levels, R&D investment, technology adoption and market structure evolve under each and are impacted by underlying market characteristics. While both OS and PL are found to be equivalent in technology outcomes, OS comes with additional advantages to participating firms. Firms in the OS framework earn higher profit and are more efficient with their R&D investments. The industry is less concentrated under OS than under PL, except when market size is very large. In both frameworks, consumer preference for new product adoption has a significant impact.

Recent research in operations focuses on how under conditions of increasing workload individuals can decrease their service time, up to a point, to complete work more quickly. As the number of tasks increases, however, workers may also manage their workload by a different process-task selection. Drawing on research on workload, individual discretion, and behavioral decision making, we theorize and then test that under conditions of increased workload, individuals may choose to complete easier tasks to manage their load. We label this behavior task completion preference (TCP). Using six years of data from a hospital emergency department, we find that physicians engage in TCP, with implications for their performance. Specifically, TCP helps physicians manage variance in service times; however, although it initially appears to improve shift-level throughput volume, after adjusting for the complexity of the work completed, TCP is related to worse throughput. Moreover, we find that engaging in easier tasks compared with hard ones is related to lower learning in service times. We then turn to the laboratory to replicate conceptually the short-term task selection effect under increased workload and show that it occurs because of both fatigue and the sense of progress individuals get from task completion. These findings provide another mechanism for the workload-speedup effect from the literature. We also discuss implications for both the research and the practice of operations in building systems to help people succeed.

This model allows us to study a multiobjective optimization, whose objective includes consumer and seller surplus as well as the sales revenue, and derive the optimal ranking decision. In addition, we propose a surplus-ordered ranking mechanism for selling some of the top slots. This mechanism is motivated in part by Amazon's sponsored search program. We show that the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism would not be applicable to our setting and propose a new mechanism. This mechanism is near optimal, performing significantly better than those that do not incentivize sellers to reveal their private information regarding each consumer purchase, such as their profit.

We study how an important IT governance mechanism—the degree of centralized decision making—affects the likelihood of cybersecurity breaches. Examining a sample of 504 U.S. higher-education institutions over a four-year period, we find that a university with centralized IT governance is associated with fewer breaches. Interestingly, the effect of centralized IT governance is contingent on the heterogeneity of a university’s computing environment: Universities with more heterogeneous IT infrastructure benefit more from centralized IT decision making. In addition, we find the relationship between centralized governance and cybersecurity breaches is most pronounced in public universities and those with more intensive research activities. Collectively, these findings highlight the tradeoff between granting autonomy and flexibility in the use of information systems and enforcing standardized, organization-wide security protocols. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","centralized decision making; cybersecurity breach; Information security; IT centralization; IT governance; IT heterogeneity","Information use; Network security; Business needs; Centralized decision making; Computing environments; Higher education institutions; Intensive research; IT infrastructures; Public universities; Security protocols; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096170236

Such buyer participation can be complicated by relationship multiplexity—that is, the buyer may simultaneously be a competitor, supplier, and/or partner of the supplier firm. Drawing on role theory, we theorize how relationship multiplexity moderates the effect of buyer participation on project success. We analyze 140 NPD projects that were executed by a contract R&D organization in the aerospace industry and find that buyer participation lowers the buyer's and the supplier's perceptions of project success for buyer-as-supplier multiplexity. Buyer participation increases the perceptions of project success in the case of buyer-as-partner multiplexity, but only when these partnerships are emergent, as opposed to engineered. Buyer participation decreases the buyer's perception of project success for relationships featuring buyer-as-competitor multiplexity but does not affect the supplier's perception in the case of buyer-as-competitor multiplexity.

However, when the total healthcare capacity in the market is limited (e.g. the number of medical staff or equipment is limited), the entrance of the toll system may offer higher salaries to attract medical staff from public hospitals (or called the free system) and reduce its capacity. Then whether or not introducing toll system in the system can reduce the waiting time becomes an issue. In this paper, we investigate the impact of capacity constraint on a two-tier healthcare system. The results show that when the total capacity is tight enough, the two-tier healthcare system often yields less social welfare than the one-tier free system; and when the total capacity is sufficient (the demand does not exceed the total capacity), the two-tier healthcare system improves the social welfare. Specially, we find under certain conditions the capacity constraint can improve social welfare. In addition, if the capacity constraint has a negative effect on the two-tier system’s performance, the government can set an appropriate upper limit for the toll system’s capacity to remove the negative effect. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capacity constraint; investment limit; queuing; Two-tier healthcare system","Commerce; Compensation (personnel); Hospitals; Investments; Toll highways; Capacity constraints; Health-care system; Healthcare industry; Policy makers; Private hospitals; queuing; Social welfare; Upper limits; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068170094

The results reveal that the impact of adverse economic conditions on the collaborative constructs of goal congruence, decision synchronization, incentive alignment, resource sharing and joint knowledge creation is nonlinear, specifically an inverted U for all of them. For collaboration constructs of information sharing and collaborative communication, the results reveal that under adverse economic conditions, the farmers do not collaborate. We also show that aspects of human capital such as age, education and farming experience affect collaboration. Our contribution lies in investigating the potential non-linear relationship between adverse economic conditions and various types of collaboration.

Papers in the literature often report sample means of such estimates along with sample standard deviations, inviting readers to make inference about means of these efficiencies using classical methods based on the standard Lindeberg–Feller central limit theorem (CLT). A number of papers explicitly make inference using the classical methods. However, the statistical properties of these estimators are (until now) unknown. This paper establishes rates of convergence and existence of limiting distributions for the various estimators. These properties are needed in order to make inference about individual producers using subsampling methods. In addition, properties of the first two moments of the estimators are derived, and these results are subsequently used to establish new CLTs for the estimators, providing formal justification for inference-making. The results reveal that the classical CLTs and methods do not provide valid inference when FDH estimators are used, and provide valid inference when DEA estimators only in a few restrictive, special cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Allocative efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; FDH; Inference; Overall efficiency","Data envelopment analysis; Allocative efficiency; Central Limit Theorem; Inference; Limiting distributions; Overall efficiency; Rates of convergence; Statistical properties; Sub-sampling methods; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075530391

However, the dynamic property of the assemble-to-order (ATO) system remain unexplored. Based on control theory, the inventory and order based production control system (IOBPCS) family, can be utilized as a base framework for assessing system dynamics. However, the underlying assumption in traditional IOBPCS-based analytical studies is that the system is linear and the delivery time to end customers is negligible or backlog is used as a surrogate indicator. Our aim is to incorporate customer delivery lead-time variance as the third assessment measure alongside capacity availability and inventory variance as part of the so-called ‘performance triangle’– capacity at the supplier, the customer order decoupling point (CODP) inventory and the delivery lead-time. Using the ‘performance triangle’ and adopting non-linear control engineering techniques, we assess the dynamic behaviour of an ATO system in the electronics sector. We benchmark the ATO system dynamics model against the IOBPCS family. We exploit frequency response analysis to ensure a robust system design by considering three measures of the ‘performance triangle’. The findings suggest delivery LT variance can be minimised by maintaining the ATO system as a true Push-Pull hybrid state with sufficient CODP stock, although increased operational cost driven by bullwhip and CODP variance need to be considered. However, if the hybrid ATO system 'switches' to the pure Push state, the mean and variance of delivery LT can be significantly increased. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Minimum reasonable capacity; Minimum reasonable lead-time; Nonlinear control theory; System dynamics; Trade-off analysis","Economic and social effects; Frequency response; Linear control systems; Production control; Sales; Supply chains; System theory; Leadtime; Minimum reasonable capacity; Nonlinear control theory; System Dynamics; Trade-off analysis; Control theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075473737

The business case for automation in these areas is difficult to justify due to increased complexity and costs arising out of process variabilities associated with those tasks. The lack of understanding of process variability in automation design means that industrial automation often does not realize the full benefits at the first attempt, resulting in the need to spend additional resource and time, to fully realize the potential. This article describes a taxonomy of variability when considering the automation of manufacturing processes. Three industrial case studies were analyzed to develop the proposed taxonomy.

These methods are used to estimate changes in firm-level manufacturing productivity in the British Isles before and after the 2007–2009 financial crisis using the Financial Analysis Made Easy (FAME) data set over the period 2005–2012.

The empirical results also indicate substantial agreement in the predictions of productivity growth for the three models. The SFA framework (and related DEA approaches) is used internationally to set tariffs in regulated industries. To have SFA, and the OP/ACF/PM/MX models that are more highly leveraged on economic optimizing assumptions, provide comparable estimates of productivity and efficiency change is reassuring. However, it also would suggest that structural approaches may not provide regulators much new information about efficiency and productivity than would less structural approaches such as SFA, while being less transparent and more difficult to justify to regulators as well as to the courts to which regulated firms often turn for relief from tariffs they perceive to be unfair or onerous. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","C23; D22; D24; G01; G31; L60; Non-structural and structural models; Olley–Pakes; Pakes–McGuire; Productivity; Stochastic frontier analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077708158

We focus on cost disturbances and measure their effects in terms of demand variation (QV) in muti-echelon informal supply chain. We show how naïve members contribute to amplification and transmission of QV across the supply chain. Strategic members (characterised by rational profit seeking behaviour) on the contrary, dampens the transmission of QV. Efficient reconfiguration solutions are proposed which minimize the QV for a specific cost disturbance scenario. Rational profit seeking behaviour is one of the criteria for selecting members in this reconfiguration. Rapid reconfiguration in these supply chains is possible due to the existence of informal contracts. A robust deviation reconfiguration solution is also proposed which performs satisfactorily over entire disturbance scenario set. Goodness of this solution is evaluated according to two metrics; namely cost penalty and robust efficiency. Lastly, an illustrative case study on apparel supply chain is presented and it is inferred from the discussion that large aggregators are both cost and robust efficient, hence their presence in supply chain improves performance of robust solution along the two metrics (cost penalty, robust efficiency). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","(T) supply chain management; Apparel supply chain; Cost disturbance; Robustness; Supply Chain design/reconfiguration","Efficiency; Profitability; Robustness (control systems); Supply chain management; Apparel supply chains; Demand variations; Emerging economies; Informal sector; Price sensitive; Robust efficiency; Robust solutions; Supply chain design; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074327819

Shortcomings inherent to DBB have had a negative effect on the key performance indicators (KPIs) of these projects. Numerous studies have been published about the benefits offered by integrated project delivery (IPD) in improving the delivery of DBB projects. Links correlating IPD principles to improvements in KPIs of DBB construction projects have not been established scientifically, thus leaving owners with no guidance on which IPD principle(s) to implement in order to improve a particular project KPI. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: Actual data were collected from 43 water and wastewater construction projects – including two control projects with full implementation of selective IPD principles – and used to compute major projects KPIs. Regression analysis and a focus group are then utilized to determine the effect of each implemented IPD principle on various project KPIs. Findings: Implementation of open communication was found to have a significant effect on reducing project cost overrun, and the co-location of teams significantly reduced the time to respond to RFIs. Collaborative decision making significantly reduced the cost of field rework. Other IPD principles showed less-significant effects on project KPIs and were concluded to be ineffective at improving the projects’ performance. Practical implications: An implementation framework is developed that can guide utility owners on which IPD principle(s) to implement in order to improve specific project KPIs. Originality/value: This study demonstrates that not all IPD principles will result in performance improvement of a project. A selective and cost-effective implementation of certain IPD principle will have to be based on the nature of the project and the particular KPIs targeted for improvement. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Novel model; Project management","Benchmarking; Construction; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decision making; Regression analysis; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Collaborative decision making; Construction projects; Cost-effective implementations; Design/methodology/approach; Integrated project deliveries; Key performance indicators; Water and wastewater; Water and wastewater treatments; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074878124

We consider a setting, where agents' actions exhibit positive local network externalities. There is uncertainty about the underlying state of the world, which impacts agents' payoffs. The platform can commit to a signaling mechanism that sends informative signals to agents upon realization of this uncertainty, thereby influencing their actions. Although this abstract setting has many applications, we discuss our results in the context of a specific one: A platform can send informative signals to agents in a social network to influence their engagement decisions with the available content, based on the realization of the inaccuracy of the content. We investigate how the platform should design its signaling mechanism to maximize engagement/minimize misinformation. The optimal (in terms of engagement/ misinformation) signaling mechanism admits a simple threshold structure: The platform recommends that agents ""engage""with the content if its inaccuracy level is below a threshold and recommends ""do not engage""otherwise. For the mechanism that maximizes engagement, these thresholds depend on agents' network positions, which we capture through a novel centrality measure. In the case where the platform seeks only to minimize misinformation (regardless of the induced engagement), common threshold mechanisms with identical thresholds across agents are optimal. This is in contrast to the engagement maximization setting, where when agents are heterogeneous in terms of their network positions, common threshold mechanisms induce substantially lower engagement than the optimal mechanisms. We also study the frontier of the engagement/misinformation levels that can be achieved via different mechanisms and characterize when common threshold mechanisms achieve optimal trade-offs. Finally, we supplement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations on a Facebook subgraph. © 2020 INFORMS.","Fake news; Information design; Misinformation; Online platforms; Social networks","Economic and social effects; Centrality measures; Different mechanisms; Information design; Local networks; Optimal mechanism; Optimal signaling; Signaling mechanisms; Subgraphs; Signaling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091631215

Predicting frequent, preventable readmissions and understanding the contributing factors is a critical problem that is being widely studied. However, few studies have examined longitudinal risk stratification, profiling, and prediction of multi-morbid, heterogeneous patient populations. We examine how readmission risk may progress over multiple emergency department visits of chronic disease patients, their early stratification into distinct trajectories with related frequencies, and the relationship of these trajectories to patient characteristics. We further extend this analysis to investigate the impact of time-stable and time-varying covariates in predicting future readmission conditional on latent class membership. Results indicate that longitudinal risk stratification can enable early identification of specific patient groups following distinct trajectories based on their presentation for emergency care. Prediction models that incorporate latent classes perform well and demonstrate the promise of trajectory modeling methods combined with advanced prediction models for longitudinal risk assessment in addressing readmission challenges. The methodology and insights from this study are generalizable to other important Information Systems problems. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

In other words, referral programs are designed to accelerate organic word-of-mouth (WOM) exposure using financial incentives. This poses a challenge, in that it mixes an intrinsically motivated process (stemming from the desire to share a customer's delight with a product or a service) with an extrinsic trigger in the form of a financial incentive. Prior research has shown that mixing intrinsic and extrinsic motivations can lead to suboptimal outcomes, which, in turn, presents a conceptual dilemma in the design of referral programs. In this paper, we demonstrate how firms can benefit from framing calls-to-action for referral programs in such a way as to move closer to the original intent of organic, intrinsically motivated WOM marketing and yet at the same time reap the benefits of using a financial incentive to increase referral rates. In particular, given a fixed incentive scheme, ceteris paribus, we show the efficacy of a prosocial call-to-action over some of the more commonly used calls-to-action observed in practice. We posit, and causally demonstrate via a large-scale randomized field experiment involving 100,000 customers, that an intrinsically prosocial element in framing the call-to-action to initiate the referral process is a necessary condition for success. When contrasted with egoistic and equitable framing of calls-to-action, the prosocial framing yields a significantly higher propensity to initiate a referral, as well as a significantly higher number of successful referrals. Additional mechanism-level analysis that interacts the treatments with customer characteristics such as repeat purchase, net promoter score, and time since last purchase, an additional field experiment with more attractive referral reward and an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment confirm the importance of an altruistic element in generating a higher quality of advocacy and reducing referral frictions. Subjects in the prosocial group report lower levels of guilt associated with sending a referral and are more able to identify family and friends' benefit as a motive for sharing referrals and therefore are more selective in sharing the referral message.

Using the panel smooth transition model, the results show a positive nonlinear relationship between Islamic banking development and economic growth. Moreover, the relationship between the macroeconomic variables and economic growth is asymmetric and regime-dependent. Further, by using the dynamic panel quantile model, we show that for many cases the Islamic banking variables lead economic growth across the quantiles. More specifically, foreign direct investment, oil production and inflation have a positive impact on economic growth during the normal financial development state, while government consumption, one-lag economic growth, terms of trade and financial development have a negative impact on economic growth for this state. The human capital index, education and the rule of law have an insignificant impact, regardless of the prevailing regime. The results for the separated oil-importing and oil-exporting economies are generally consistent with the combined sample regarding the Islamic banking development variables.

The two industrial sector HARMONEY (Human And Resources with MONEY) model enables exploration of interdependencies among resource extraction rate and depletion; the accumulation of population, capital, and debt; and the distribution of money flows within the economy. Using a post-Keynesian economic framework, we find that wage share declines after the model reaches a constant per capita resource extraction rate, with the level of investment and markup on costs determining the rate of decline. This pattern is consistent with data for the United States. Thus, the model framework enables realistic investigation of trade-offs between economic distribution, size, and resources consumption between sectors as well as between labor and capital. These trade-offs are core to the debates regarding environmental and socioeconomic sustainability. This model serves as a platform upon which to add features to explore long-term sustainability questions such as a transition to low-carbon energy. © 2019","Dynamics; Energy; Long-term growth; Macroeconomics; Post-Keynesian; Resources","biophysics; energetics; extraction method; human resource; long-term change; macroeconomics; numerical model; resource availability; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076269611

The performance evaluation and prediction of the IC industry is of great significance for promoting the development of this industry. In this paper, a hybrid method is proposed to study the performance of the IC industry from the perspectives of evaluation and prediction, which is unique as it evaluates the performance at past, current and future terms simultaneously. Firstly, a dynamic data envelopment analysis model is used to explore the performances of the IC industry between China and the United States from 2008 to 2017. Furthermore, in order to figure out the main sources of the inefficiency, the projection analysis is implemented based on the performance scores. Then, the grey model GM(1, 1) is employed to predicted the performance of China's IC industry from 2018 to 2022, so as to point out the progressive direction for the future development of the industry. The empirical results show that: (1) as far as performance is concerned, there is a significant gap between China and the United States in the IC industry during 2008–2017, among which the most obvious gap is occurring in “IC packaging & testing”, followed by “IC design” and “wafer fabrication”; (2) the primary cause of the low performance in China's IC industry is the redundancy of the inputs, especially in “IC packaging & testing”, and the redundancy problem of labour investment is found to be the most serious; (3) according to the predicted results, the IC industry in China will steadily increase in terms of the performance scores in general, and the performance improvement of “IC packaging & testing” is relatively obvious, while the other two categories have a slight range of growth. Finally, the policy implications of improving the performance of the IC industry are put forward. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic DEA; Grey model; Integrated circuit industry; Projection analysis","data envelopment analysis; industrial development; industrial performance; modeling; performance assessment; prediction; semiconductor industry; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066112172

Based on interviews with experts regarding ranges of input parameters used in single-hectare financial models and Monte Carlo simulation method, we examine what are the main factors that influence internal rates of returns (IRRs) in several global timber plantation investment opportunities: loblolly pine on the U.S. Atlantic coastal plain; Douglas-fir plantations in the western U.S.; loblolly pine and eucalyptus plantations in Brazil; radiata pine and eucalyptus plantations in Chile; and pine and oak stands in Poland. The results show that excluding the price of land, biological growth and timber prices were the most influential variables that impacted the IRRs across global timberland investments. In addition, some country-specific factors, such as planting costs (Chile) and management costs (Poland and the U.S.), were identified as crucial when considering timberland investments in these countries. Investments in South America's pine plantations are characterized by the same level of returns as eucalyptus opportunities, but with lower risk. The same was found for Douglas-fir investments in the Pacific Northwest compared to loblolly pine in the U.S. South. If Poland were an investable alternative, which is not the case so far, any investments in oak and pine stands are not recommended yet, given that for the same level of risk, better returns may be achieved in Douglas-fir plantations in the U.S. PNW. The Monte Carlo method utilized provides easily interpretable representation of the robustness of timberland investment estimates in selected regions and should become standard practice in forest-business decision making. However, more accurate probability density functions need to be determined in further research, using, for instance, historical data and kernel density estimation, rather than “lack of information” (triangular) distributions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Financial model; IRR; Monte Carlo; Risk; Timberland investments","Costs; Decision making; Financial markets; Forestry; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Risks; Timber; Eucalyptus plantations; Financial modeling; Interpretable representation; Investment estimates; Investment opportunities; Kernel Density Estimation; Monte Carlo simulation methods; Portfolio diversification; Investments; Costs; Decision Making; Eucalyptus; Forestry; Investment; Pinus Taeda; Plantations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075570114

However, the process of their emergence may not only be characterized by technological progress but also by setbacks. We offer a perspective on technology emergence that explicitly incorporates setbacks into the technology's evolution and explains how industry participants may react to setbacks in emerging technologies. We consider that the locus of innovation in an emerging technology encompasses different types of organizations (industry incumbents, entrants and public research organizations (PROs)) who operate in different institutional environments, and explore how these organizations react to setbacks in terms of their R&D efforts. We study two emerging biotechnologies in the global pharmaceutical industry - gene therapy (GT) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The emergence of both technologies during the 1990s was punctuated by periods of setbacks. We observe a gradual increase in industry participants' R&D efforts during periods of progress and a significant decline in those efforts immediately following setbacks. The decline in R&D efforts was more pronounced for firms than for PROs as well as for those firms that were listed on the stock market in contrast to those that were privately financed. Finally, the decline in R&D efforts towards GT was much more pronounced for those organizations located in countries with high capital fluidity. These findings reinforce that organizational and institutional characteristics that are typically attributed to facilitate R&D efforts towards emerging technologies do induce greater levels of those efforts during periods of progress. However, the same characteristics are also associated with a significant decline in R&D efforts immediately following periods of setbacks. Overall, the study illustrates how setbacks reconfigure the locus of innovation in emerging technologies and offers a richer perspective on technology emergence as one that is rooted in both progress and setbacks. In so doing, it highlights the challenges of sustaining technological progress and offers guidance for policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biotechnology; Emerging technologies; Incumbents and entrants; Public research organizations; R&D efforts; Setbacks","Biotechnology; Gene therapy; Monoclonal antibodies; Economic growths; Emerging technologies; Incumbents and entrants; Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); Pharmaceutical industry; Public research; Setbacks; Technological progress; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075213762

However, capturing these spatial relationships within the confines of a stated preference study has proved challenging. We propose and implement a novel approach to incorporating space within the design and presentation of stated preference choice experiments (CE). Using an investigation of preferences concerning land use change in Great Britain, CE scenarios are presented through individually generated maps, tailored to each respondent’s home location. Each choice situation is generated in real time and is underpinned by spatially tailored experimental designs that reflect current British land uses and incorporate locational attributes relating to physical and administrative dimensions of space. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first CE study to integrate space into both the survey design and presentation of choice tasks in this way. Presented methodology provides means for testing how presentation of spatial information influence stated preferences.

Around three quarters of all new homes in the UK are currently built speculatively by the developer-led private housing sector. However, demand for self-build housing is growing. Concurrently, there is also a need to address the sustainability of homes, which represent 29% of final energy consumption in the UK. There is a clear imperative to develop business models within the construction sector in which both social and environmental sustainability are inherent. The aim of this paper is to explore professional and expert opinions on the suitability of group self-build housing as a development model for zero carbon homes. A Policy Delphi study was conducted both at a national level in England and at a regional level in South West England. In this iterative, non-contact research method, online questionnaires were used to gather data from the same panellists over three rounds. Panellists were drawn from seven groups: public sector, specialist groups/experts, housing associations, housing developers, designers, contractors, and financial institutions. The findings highlight that the panellists believe that group self-build is well suited as a development model for the delivery of zero carbon homes and sustainable communities.

There are few rigorous empirical estimates regarding the efficacy of these policies, particularly for outcomes such as transit ridership or traffic flow, which are of key policy relevance. Exploiting features of the roll out of SFpark, a smart-parking program for the city of San Francisco, we are able to estimate its effect upon public transit usage and traffic flow. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and a rich micro data-set on transit bus ridership along with data from SFpark, we find that SFpark led to a significant increase in bus ridership and a reduction in traffic flow. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the economic benefits resulting from avoided pollution and reduced congestion consequent to SFpark is larger than the approximate nominal costs of the program. Overall, our results suggest that smart-parking programs can help mitigate many traffic-related externalities, yielding significant economic benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Mass transit; Parking policy; Smart-parking; Transportation","Air pollution; Costs; Economics; Information dissemination; Mass transportation; Pollution; Transportation; Back-of-the-envelope calculations; Difference-in-differences; Economic benefits; Empirical estimate; Mass transit; Parking policy; Smart parking; Transit riderships; Economic and social effects; atmospheric pollution; parking; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation policy; transportation system; San Francisco [California]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076038605

However, studies on REC as for an individual country-case and panel case approach for top emitters are rare. Against this backdrop, this study investigates the long-run drivers of REC by using a time series data from 1990 to 2015. The FMOLS-grouped results indicate that economic growth and trade openness increase REC whereas population growth has a negative but significant impact on REC. To check for causal links, the innovating accounting approach using variance decomposition analysis is applied. The results show that there is a unidirectional causality running from economic growth, trade openness, and population growth to REC. Further, the predictive accuracy of the FMOLS based econometric output and the bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) is analyzed. The Bi-LSTM formulated algorithm outperformed the econometric output. The Bi-LSTM is utilized to forecast REC to the year 2030. The output from the Bi-LSTM shows that China, the US, India, the Russian Federation's, and Japan's REC will hit ∼11.3395, ∼11.1245, ∼34.6969, ∼2.9097, and ∼7.4859, respectively. The US and Japan's REC levels will increase while that of China, India, and Russia Federation will decrease. As a policy implication, new policy directives for China, India, and the Russian Federation are required to boost REC levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM); Economic growth; Forecasting; Fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS); Renewable energy consumption","Commerce; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Long short-term memory; Pollution control; Public policy; Sustainable development; Cleaner production; Environmental sustainability; Policy implications; Population growth; Predictive accuracy; Renewable energy consumption; Russian federation; Variance decomposition; Population statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089372585

In this paper we propose a balanced benchmarking methodology to address the fairness issue in performance evaluation. The methodology used to create performance measures is data envelopment analysis (DEA), a tool designed to evaluate the relative efficiencies of comparable decision-making units (DMUs); i.e. all DMUs use the same inputs and outputs and experience the same general operating conditions. In many applications, however, the DMUs may experience non-homogenous operating conditions or environments. An example might be a set of manufacturing plants where some have been upgraded and others not. Such settings can necessitate modifying the DEA structure such as to make allowance for different environmental conditions. Such a model is developed herein to create a level playing field for performance evaluation in two different settings: a setting involving hybrid and conventional (non-hybrid) vehicles; and another setting involving bank branches located in poverty and non-poverty regions. Our model and empirical tests contribute not only to the advance of balanced benchmarking methodologies, but also to the practice of incorporating fairness in performance evaluation across multiple products and organizations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Balanced Benchmarking; DEA; Disadvantaged Decision-Making Units; Fairness in Performance Evaluation","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Benchmarking methodology; Decision making unit; Environmental conditions; Level playing fields; Manufacturing plant; Operating condition; Performance measure; Relative efficiency; Benchmarking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086653627

However, a large amount of carbon may be emitted from the use of products. Motivated by these issues, we analytically investigate the impact of environmental concern and the policies of regulators, and consumer environmental concern on product introduction. Our results show that (i) whether emissions trading regulations benefit firms depends on the quality improvement capability, and the interaction between emissions price and allowed emissions cap; (ii) the environmental concern of consumers helps firms obtain higher profits when quality improvement capability is relatively high, and always benefits environmental performance; and (iii) relatively low environmental concern set by regulators is detrimental to the maximization of social welfare, whereas high regulator environmental concern helps to maximize social welfare but at the expense of reducing firms’ profits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions cap; Environmental concern; Product introduction; Quality improvement capability; Social welfare","Carbon; Emission control; Environmental management; Profitability; Consumer expectations; Emissions regulations; Environmental concerns; Environmental performance; Product introduction; Product manufacturing; Quality improvement; Regulatory interventions; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092899803

It is vital for the various construction firms and industry stakeholders to understand the different types of risks that affect their businesses and financial bottom lines. This research created a systematic methodology implementing a new set of text mining methods to identify and classify risk types affecting the publicly traded construction companies, by leveraging their 10-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A structured procedure was developed to apply advancements from text mining and natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from textual disclosures. A state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm named FastText was implemented to identify risk patterns and classify the text into appropriate risk types. Key findings showed that operational and financial risks associated with doing business most commonly are disclosed in the risk disclosures filed by the publicly traded construction firms. A steady monotonic increase was found in the average number of total risk disclosures from 2006 to 2018. Over the same period, growth occurred in the proportion of technology risks, reputation/intangible assets risks, financial markets risk, and third-party risks. The primary contributions of this research are (1) the development of a new methodology which serves as a risk thermometer for identification and quantification of risk at an individual company level, subindustry level, and the overall industry level; and (2) minimization of any existing information asymmetry in risk studies by utilization of a source of data that previously has not been used by construction researchers. It is anticipated that the developed methodology and its results can be used by (1) publicly traded construction companies to understand risks affecting themselves and their peers; and (2) surety bond companies and insurance providers to supplement their risk pricing models; and (3) equity investors and capital financial institutions to make more-informed risk-based decisions for their investments in the construction business. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Commerce; Construction industry; Deep learning; Investments; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Risk assessment; Text mining; Construction business; Construction companies; Financial institution; Industry stakeholders; Information asymmetry; NAtural language processing; Securities and Exchange Commissions; Systematic methodology; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092227890

This paper applies systems thinking approach at the household level for the first time. The approach takes into consideration energy supply and demand, waste management and resource recovery from waste in a single system. Combining energy and waste management analysis enables better understanding of the systems at household level and can address resource efficiency, fuel poverty and environmental issues more effectively at the national level. This study adopts the Systems Thinking Approach to Resource Recovery (STARR) framework to identify the potential improvements that can be made within the system. Three models of households on energy and waste management, including “waste-and-energy”, “waste-to-energy” and “reduced consumption” models, are examined through assessments of economic, environmental and social dimensions. These models are further explored through different scenarios, by considering the adoption of renewable solar photovoltaic (PV) energy supply, increasing recycling rate, integrating energy from waste into household and reducing consumption of resources and waste generation. The scenario with the least environmental impact involves adopting a concerted approach through switching to solar PV, increasing recycling rate and using electricity generated from residual waste, with global warming potential (GWP) of −1308 kg CO2-equivalent per year and total saving/income of £680 per year, on a one household basis. © 2020","Circular economy; LCA; Material flow analysis; Net zero; Solar PV; Sustainability assessment","Economics; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Global warming; Natural resources; Recycling; System theory; Energy from wastes; Environmental issues; Global warming potential; Management analysis; Resource efficiencies; Resource recovery; Resource utilisation; Solar photovoltaics; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088888321

Selling remanufactured high-technology products is a challenge because of the shorter residual life of usage and potential cannibalisation of new items. Smartphones and tablets, as hi-tech products, are replaced by new generation models quickly due to rapid development. Products belonging to earlier generations become less demanding. Customer’s acceptance for outmoded remanufactured items is even less. Learning how value depreciated is vital for the sellers to make a wise price decision for these new and remanufactured products belonging to various generations. This study leverages transaction data of iPhones and iPads from eBay, uses partial least square method to explore the factors that affect value depreciation rate and price differentiation between new and remanufactured products. Variables which are categorised as marketing elements, technology features, appearance design, and customer attention are hypothesised to be critical to value depreciation. The result differs in iPhones and iPads but shows some consistency that time since release, product thickness, camera resolution, and fans/hits ratio are highly correlated to the value depreciation rate.

Design/methodology/approach: The study deploys a qualitative approach to generate the appropriate decision criteria. The balanced scorecard and Pareto's chart (using Minitab® version 18) were used for gathering and analysing the pertinent criteria. Findings: The process of evaluating and selecting the right manufacturers is essential. Manufacturer (supplier) selection is no longer decided solely based on cost/price criterion; currently, the quality and delivery criteria prevail. Additional incorporated criteria include price/cost, technical capability, production facilities and capacity, customer satisfaction and impression, geographical location, management and organisation, financial position, environmental concern, performance history, repair service, information technology and communication systems, procedural compliance, labour relation record, reputation, flexibility or diversification, attitude, operating controls, business desire, packaging ability, past business records, trust and loyalty, training aids, complaint handling service, warranties and claim policies, reciprocal arrangements, research and development and innovation, modern slavery concern, sustainable capability, collaborative/partnership and responsiveness. The study proposed a conceptual framework of an EE alongside how manufacturers working as a single virtual entity can consider the supply chain operations reference (SCOR®) model. Research limitations/implications: The identified CSDC are suitable for order allocation to domestic manufacturers. The deployed approaches could be extended to the mixed and quantitative approaches for increasing the generalisability. Originality/value: The study establishes the pertinent CSDC that are important to execute equitable order distribution to manufacturers in an EE framework. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced scorecard; Buyer-supplier relationships; Decision-making; Extended enterprise; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Supply chain operations reference model","Compliance control; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Environmental technology; Information management; Manufacture; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Balanced scorecards; Buyer supplier relationship; Extended enterprise; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Supply chain operations reference models; Research and development management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082183758

Two measures of disability diversity are examined: the number of disability categories employed in a production line and the evenness of disability category dispersion among workers employed in an apparel production line. Academic/practical relevance: The problem has both academic and practical relevance. From an academic standpoint, the current literature does not study the implications of employing individuals with disabilities and their impact on productivity with microdata. The issue also has practical relevance because it ties into recent managerial interest to employ individuals with disabilities in organizations. According to statistics, only 35% of workers with disabilities have some form of significant full-time employment. Methodology: The study uses panel regression analyses to test the impact of disability diversity (number of disability categories and evenness of disability category dispersion) of workers in a production line using detailed multiyear data on the productivity of apparel manufacturing cells. Results: Two key insights emerged from the analyses. First, productivity can be enhanced by increasing the diversity of workers with disabilities in the workforce within a garment-manufacturing cell. Specifically, productivity is best at moderate levels of disability categories in a team. Second, team productivity is higher at greater levels of evenness of disability category dispersion. Managerial implications: The analysis in this paper sheds light on the potential benefits of integrating individuals with disabilities into organizations and its implications on productivity. Specifically, the study finds evidence that having moderate levels of disability categories on a team with higher levels of evenness in disability category dispersion is associated with better productivity rather than having a concentrated team focused on a specific disability. The implications of the results and limitations for the study as well as its potential insights into the context of social enterprises that employ individuals with disabilities are discussed.

Lendwithcare is amongst the first crowdfunding platforms specifically dedicated to support individual and group entrepreneurs in developing countries through partner microfinance institutions. A key objective of Lendwithcare is to identify the attributes (i.e., the characteristics of crowdfunding projects in their online descriptions) that affect investors/potential investors when taking their investment decision. This paper proposes a decision rule-based approach to address this issue. This approach relies on the Dominance-Based Rough Approach (DRSA), which is a well-known multicriteria sorting method. The outputs of DRSA are a collection of if-then decision rules and a collection of attribute reducts. In this paper, new measures are proposed for calculating the relative importance of condition attributes based on the characteristics of decision rules and of attribute reducts. Decision rule-based measures are parameterised in order to consider the characteristics of decision rules using both learning and testing datasets. The proposed measures can be aggregated into a comprehensive measure indicating the overall importance of each condition attribute. Furthermore, the proposed measures are extended in order to compute the relative importance of a collection of condition attributes taken together. In addition, decision rule-based measures are extended to evaluate the relative importance of specific values of condition attributes. The proposed approach has been applied and validated using real-world data from Lendwithcare. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Attribute reducts; Crowdfunding; Decision rules; Dominance-based rough set approach; Lendwithcare; Relative importance; Rough sets","Developing countries; Economics; Investments; Condition attributes; Decision rules; Investment decisions; Key objective; Multi-criteria; Number of peoples; Sorting method; Specific values; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085128061

This research is motivated by the important problem of improving the predictions for organ transplantation outcomes, which can inform updates made to organ allocation protocols, post-transplantation care pathways, and clinical resource utilization. In pursuit of our overarching goal and motivating problem, we propose a novel two-stage machine learning-based framework for obtaining monotonic probabilities over time. The first stage uses the standard approach of using independent machine learning models to predict transplantation outcomes for each time-period of interest. In the second stage, we calibrate the survival probabilities over time using isotonic regression. To show the utility of our framework, we applied it on a national registry of U.S. heart transplants from 1987 to 2016. The first stage produces an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) between 0.60 and 0.71 for years 1–10. While the 1-year prediction AUC result is comparable to the reported results in the literature, our 10-year AUC of 0.70 is higher than the current state-of-the-art results. More importantly, we show that the application of isotonic regression to calibrate the survival probabilities for each patient over the 10-year period guarantees monotonicity, while capitalizing on the data-driven and individualized nature of machine learning models. To promote future research, our code and analysis are publicly available on GitHub. Furthermore, we created a web app titled “H-TOP: Heart Transplantation Outcome Predictor” to encourage practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Heart transplant; Isotonic regression; Medical informatics; Multi-period forecasting; United network for organ sharing","Clinical research; Forecasting; Clinical resources; Heart transplantation; Isotonic regression; Machine learning models; Probability constraints; Probability curves; Receiver operating curves; Survival probabilities; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089083482

We propose a novel multi-objective co-evolutionary approach for supply chain gap analysis by hybridizing two well-known algorithms of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) and multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed algorithm considers the best solution of NSGAII at each iteration and uses it as the initial population in MOPSO. We consider three objective functions, including the expected costs, the total time, and customer satisfaction. The house of quality and quality function deployment is used to transform customer requirements into product characteristics. We also use a response surface methodology with multi-objective decision making for tuning the parameters since metaheuristic methods are generally sensitive to input parameters. We finally generate several random problems with different scenarios to compare the performance of our hybrid approach with singular methods. Five performance measures (i.e., mean ideal distance, diversification metric, quality metric, data envelopment analysis, and hypervolume metric) are used for this comparison. The results show the hybrid approach proposed in this study outperforms singular NSGAII and MOPSO metaheuristics in most scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","gap analysis; Grey theory; Multi-objective optimization; Quality function deployment; supply chain","Customer satisfaction; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality function deployment; Screening; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Co-evolutionary approach; Customer requirements; Meta-heuristic methods; Multi objective decision making; Multiple objective particle swarm optimizations; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Product characteristics; Response surface methodology; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087785465

There is also a need to estimate the production frontier of best performers in such environments. Part of the difficulty in constructing this frontier is that massive amounts of data are generated daily with the result being that the set of best performers is constantly changing. Furthermore, measurement errors can influence datasets as well as the estimation of a production frontier. Outliers can also substantially affect the estimated production frontier. Efforts have been made in the past three decades to deal with datasets that might include such outliers; these methods are mostly semiautomatic or require significant computation time when a large dataset is involved. The few existing research on large datasets also focuses on the computational process of measuring a production frontier without identifying the possible influence of outliers to the estimated frontier. In the current paper, for the first time in the literature of data envelopment analysis (DEA), we develop an automatic framework with the computational capability and accuracy needed when big datasets (with multiple inputs and multiple outputs) are considered. Several examples, simulation experiments, and real-life applications are discussed to demonstrate the power of the proposed framework. A data analysis with illustrative graphs is provided to clearly show the methodology. In terms of estimating the production frontier, the method is robust, user-friendly, and substantially decreases the requirement of user judgment while at the same time allowing for the incorporation of such judgement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Context-dependent; Data envelopment analysis; Nonparametric method; Outliers; Production frontier","Data envelopment analysis; Statistics; Computational capability; Computational process; Context dependent; Multiple inputs and multiple outputs; Nonparametric methods; Outliers; Production frontier; Real-life applications; Large dataset",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082798579

However, little is currently known about how top management teams (TMTs) cope with such behavior. To address this shortfall, we draw on the upper echelons literature to advance a contingent account of the factors that differentiate well-functioning and dysfunctional TMTs. Focusing on the psychological context surrounding the TMT, we theorize that cognitive consensus, power decentralization, and behavioral integration are key generative mechanisms that enable TMTs to countermand the potentially deleterious consequences of political behavior. We corroborate our theorizing using a field study of 117 strategic decisions, drawn from multiple TMT informants and secondary databases. Confirming the majority of our hypotheses, our findings indicate that behaviorally integrated and decentralized TMTs are better equipped to attenuate the potentially damaging effects of organizational politics, thereby safeguarding the quality of their decision processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral strategy; Cognition; Political behavior; Strategic decision-making; Top management teams; Upper echelons","Decision theory; Human resource management; Behavioral strategy; Cognition; Political behaviors; Strategic decision making; Top management teams; Upper echelons; Decision making; cognition; database; decentralization; decision making; performance assessment; political ideology; power relations; strategic approach; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075862365

The results show that facilitated access to capital makes investments in sustainable technologies more attractive for all firms, especially for small and medium enterprises. Without policy instruments such as carbon price, the decrease in emissions in the long-term is due to investments in natural gas-based technologies, as they typically have lower capital and operating costs, and also lower electricity consumption than coal-based production. Conversely, with policy instruments in place, a strong decrease in emissions occurs between 2060 and 2080 due to investors choosing natural gas and biomethane-based technologies, with carbon capture and storage. In the long term, natural gas and biomethane could compete, with the outcome depending on infrastructure, supply chain availability and land use constraints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent -based modelling; Ammonia manufacturing; Energy systems modelling; Net-zero emissions","Ammonia; Autonomous agents; Carbon capture; Chemical industry; Coal industry; Computational methods; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Land use; Natural gas; Operating costs; Simulation platform; Supply chains; Agent-based modelling; Capital and operating costs; Electricity-consumption; Haber-Bosch process; Industrial enterprise; Investment decisions; Small and medium enterprise; Sustainable technology; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084943269

The associated security risk and low customization capability, however, create challenges for the adoption of cloud services. In this paper, we construct a game-theoretical model that involves two vendors—one that provides cloud service on a pay-per-use basis and the other that sells on-premises software at a one-time licensing fee—and consumers who are heterogeneous in their usage frequencies in an environment in which negative security externalities are present. We study the competitive implications of security risk and product customization capability on consumer purchase choice and vendors’ pricing and investment strategies. Although it is generally believed that cloud services are more vulnerable to security breaches, our results demonstrate that in high-security-loss environments in which consumers incur a large loss per use if struck by attacks, using cloud service yields a lower average expected loss for consumers compared with on-premises software. By endogenizing vendors’ investment decisions on security and customization, our investigation highlights that in low-security-loss environments, the cloud vendor has no incentive to invest effort in reducing security risk, but the on-premises vendor will increase security investment when the probability of attacks on its product becomes higher.

This information can be used to update the project schedule to anticipate the eventual project duration and cost more precisely. But hardly any studies analyzed how more accurate or reliable activity tracking information can be compared with the initial (planned) estimates, let alone which mathematical forecasting expressions are the most accurate. This paper quantified forecasting accuracy by extracting over 3,000 activities with partial tracking information (i.e., those which have already started but are not yet complete) from a real project data set. Two expressions for forecasting the activity duration and cost were tested by comparing their performance with initial (planned) and final (actual) values. The contributions to the body of knowledge are fourfold. First, it was shown that activity tracking information considerably outperforms planned estimates. Second, using two expressions can significantly minimize the deviations of time and cost estimates. Third, remaining activities' duration and cost estimates can be closely modeled with log-normal distributions as a function of the activities' percentage complete. Fourth, variability decreases linearly as activities approach their end. These findings allow project managers to better anticipate and model the duration and cost variability of ongoing activities and to improve the forecasting accuracy of the project duration and cost estimates. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Activity cost; Activity duration; Forecasting; Project; Scheduling; Tracking","Cost estimating; Estimation; Forecasting; Normal distribution; Activity duration; Activity tracking; Body of knowledge; Forecasting accuracy; Log-normal distribution; Mathematical forecasting; Project activities; Project schedules; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090978973

A firm determines product quality and prices in an evolving product line to maximize profit. In particular, given the prices and quality of products that already exist in a product line, the firm optimizes prices and/or quality of the new products. Academic/practical relevance: We extend the literature on discrete choice models to include the interaction between product quality and product price and consider two variations of the problem, each mirroring a relevant decision setting found in practice: Variation i is a price-optimization problem in which the firm determines prices of the new products given the quality. Variation ii is a joint price and quality optimization of the new products. Methodology: We apply convex optimization techniques and analyze properties of optimal solutions. Results: We establish concavity of the profit function under price optimization and present tractable solution approaches for the joint quality–price optimization. For each problem variation, we characterize the optimal solution and develop efficient algorithms. We show that the interaction of price and quality is central not only to reconciling the divergence of the existing literature’s equal-markup price prediction from differentiated markups observed in practice, but also for explaining differentiated quality measures across products; this empirically observed strategy can now be quantified and optimized with the model developed in this paper. In addition, we show that the presence of existing products tends to drive the firm to offer new products with both higher quality and prices because of the price–quality interaction. Managerial implications: Findings of this paper offer not only managerial guidelines, but also tools for decision support because of the wide empirical applicability of the MNL model. An important managerial implication is that the lack of realism in the linear utility of the MNL model can be addressed by including price–quality interaction, which is central to understanding the quality and price decision in product-line design. The interaction rationalizes the matching of high markup with high quality and justifies differentiated offering of new products in the presence of existing products. © 2020 INFORMS.","Multinomial logit; Pricing; Product line design; Revenue management","Convex optimization; Decision support systems; Managers; Optimal systems; Product design; Profitability; Quality control; Multinomial Logit; Multinomial logit model; Optimal solutions; Price optimisation; Price quality; Product line design; Product price; Productline; Products quality; Revenue management; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087940682

The analysis shows that many CEE countries have improved their institutional setting, especially the control of corruption. The regression results indicate that the control of corruption and democracy have a positive and significant impact on the GDP. Also, political stability promotes growth, while the quality of regulation is statistically insignificant. Finally, the rule of law and economic freedom accelerate economic growth.

The negative externalities associated with these vehicles rise further when road accidents are considered. Almost all such accidents involving fatalities transpire when private users are in single vehicle incidents or collide with each other. Though autonomous vehicle technology can mitigate these effects, widespread adoption and proliferation demands cost competitiveness with the status quo; namely, personally owned and operated, conventional vehicles. Here we show that this prospect may - in a commercially owned and operated enterprise – be unlikely. Causal factors of relevance include low capacity utilization rates and impracticable profit expectations. In a single ridership ‘autonomous taxi’ model, we find capacity utilization rates would need to improve from 52 percent to 100 percent and profits lowered by 37 percent (from 27 cents to 17 cents on a per-mile basis) for autonomous taxis to offer fares that are comparable with personally owned, conventional vehicles. In a multiple ridership model, the affordance of these fares requires a 30 percent increase in vehicle occupancy (from 1.67 to 2.2) and a 75 percent increase (1.67 to 2.92) were even lower fares offered to incentivize shared, autonomous taxi use over personally owned, conventional vehicles. We conclude that consideration of the opportunity costs of driving are integral to the widespread adoption of a technology that may dramatically improve public health outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous taxis; Conventional vehicles; Mobility as a service; Public policy","Profitability; Public health; Taxicabs; Autonomous vehicle technologies; Capacity utilization rate; Cost competitiveness; Life threatening conditions; Negative externalities; Opportunity costs; Passenger vehicles; Vehicle occupancies; Accidents; comparative study; incentive; numerical model; profitability; public health; taxi transport; technology adoption; transportation economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085990212

However, an appropriate feature selection could improve its reliability. Differently from conventional feature reduction methods, we hypothesised that applying feature reduction first and then augmenting the reduced feature space could improve classification performance further. Thus, a novel two-stage Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based feature transformation method, which involves both feature reduction and augmentation (2-Tra-GA), was developed, tested and validated. This 2-Tra-GA was later coupled to ML-based classifiers for a prognostic prediction. Clinical data with nineteen (N = 19) features on 320 patients with hepatitis obtained from the University of California-Irvine ML repository were utilised. When tested on these data, the GA-based feature reduction resulted in a reduced set with fifteen (N=15) features that led to the highest classification accuracy and reliability. Augmenting the reduced set by adding transformed features via an interpolation method (N=32 features in total, 15 reduced and 17 transformed) further improved the classification performance. Additionally, the performance of this novel hybrid algorithm was evaluated against classifiers alike and published studies. Applying feature reduction, then augmenting only such relevant features improved classification performance and computational efficiency, also over conventional wrapper-based feature selection methods. Thus, a novel hybrid DSS to improve the reliability of the prediction of prognosis for hepatitis is proposed. Findings also support the application of the proposed hybrid method to improve clinical decision making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support system; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature augmentation; Genetic algorithm; Hepatitis; Machine learning","Computational efficiency; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Reliability; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Clinical decision making; Decision support system (dss); Feature transformations; Interpolation method; University of California; Wrapper-based feature selection; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084352826

Although some on-demand service providers rely strictly on either traditional employees or independent contractors, others rely on a blended workforce, which melds a layer of contingent workers with a core of permanent employees. In deciding on the “right number of right people to staff at the right time,” managers must appropriately weigh the pertinent tradeoffs. In this paper, we study cost-minimizing staffing decisions in service systems where the manager must decide on how many flexible (contractors) and/or fixed (full-time) agents to staff in order to effectively balance operating costs, varying customer demand patterns, and supply-side uncertainty while not compromising on the quality of service offered to customers. We consider a queueing-theoretic framework where the number of servers is random, because part of the workforce is flexible. Because the staffing problem with a random number of servers is analytically intractable, we formulate two problem relaxations based on fluid and stochastic fluid formulations, and we establish their accuracies in large systems by relying on an asymptotic, many-server mode of analysis. We derive the optimal staffing policy and glean insights into the appropriateness of alternative workforce models in on-demand services. We also shed light on the distinction between demand-side (customer arrival rates) and supply-side (number of servers) uncertainties in queueing systems. © 2020 INFORMS","Many-server queues; On-demand workforce; Random capacity; Sharing economy","Contractors; Managers; Operating costs; Personnel selection; Quality of service; Sales; Stochastic systems; Customer arrivals; Customer demands; Full-time employees; In-service systems; On-demand services; Optimal staffing; Permanent employees; Staffing decisions; Employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092061375

This is principally true for younger workers at employers where skill development is encouraged, and the effects are stronger in thicker markets where workers with newer skills have more outside options.

In line with current theories in judgment and decision making, we hypothesize that people weigh these dimensions subjectively and perceive them asymmetrically, consistent with prospect theory. Costs for the donor are typically perceived as losses, whereas benefits for recipients are perceived as gains. In four studies, we presented several scenarios to participants in which both donation amounts (costs) and number of lives helped (benefits) were manipulated while keeping the ratio of costs and benefits constant. Results from Studies 1 and 2 showed that willingness to help decreased as donation amounts and number of lives helped increased.

Stern School of Business, United States","It is common for firms to forecast stationary demand using simple exponential smoothing (SES) due to the ease of computation and understanding of the methodology. We consider a retailer who observes autoregressive moving average (ARMA) demand but for the sake of convenience, uses the widely available SES method to forecast its demand. This creates a potential disconnect between the true mechanism generating demand and the forecasting methodology. We show that the supplier, given a sufficiently long history of the retailer's orders, is always able to recover the retailer's true shocks, and in addition is able to infer the true ARMA model generating the retailer's demand process if the retailer shares its exponential smoothing parameter. We further prove that under these assumptions, the supplier is then able to infer the retailer's demand as well. Thus, the supplier is in possession of expertise that would benefit the retailer. However, as a result of the supplier sharing its forecasting expertise, we demonstrate that the demand the supplier will face can have a smaller or larger mean squared forecast error than when the retailer uses the suboptimal SES forecast. In addition, we show that if the supplier provides its forecasting expertise to the retailer, there may be value in the retailer sharing its demand with the supplier. We also perform a simulation study for a special case of an AR(1) demand process and demonstrate that as the sample size of data increases, the difference of mean squared errors between the supplier's estimations of the retailer's demand shocks and the retailer's true demand shocks converges to zero. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

However, traditional measures of complexity only capture manufacturing-based capabilities, ignoring the growing importance of services in global trade. Technological innovations are increasingly splintering and disembodying services so they can be produced, transmitted, and consumed globally. This paper incorporates the role of service globalization to present a more complete picture of the economic complexity of nations. Using a non-linear iterative algorithm, this paper ranks the ‘fitness’ of countries based on the diversity and ‘complexity’ of specialization patterns. Modern technology-enabled service exports are fairly complex specializations but becoming increasingly ubiquitous. Developing countries show greater economic strength accounting for the growing tradability of services.

Both have been identified as ways to improve organizational value. Previous studies disagree regarding whether they can work together. This study investigates if managers balance stakeholders and lean thinking in decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: This research investigates if both lean thinking and stakeholder salience share common literature by using data mining. It surveys organizations that perceive themselves as lean and have multiple diverse stakeholders to determine whether waste and salience are considered when making decisions. An ANOVA is done to see if organization type, management level, organization size, geographic location, or lean maturity has an effect on the priority of stakeholder salience or lean thinking's waste variants when making decisions. Findings: Findings of this research are: 1) stakeholders salience criteria are considered more often than lean thinking's waste variants in decision-making by managers as a whole and in particular by middle-level managers and senior managers. However, lean thinking's waste variants are considered as often as stakeholder salience criteria by first-line managers. 2) The ranking of stakeholder salience in making decisions is not affected by organization type, respondent position, organization size, perceived lean experience, or geographic location. The organization type, organization size, lean experience, and location do not affect the ranking of lean thinking variants either. But the ranking of lean thinking's waste variants is significantly different for first-line, middle-level, and senior managers. Middle-level managers rank lean thinking higher than that of either first-line or senior-level. Because of this, middle managers have a more balanced approach in using lean thinking and stakeholder salience than other managers. 3) Stakeholder salience criteria have a significantly higher ranking than lean thinking variants in making decisions for all organization types: manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. Originality/Value: This research demonstrates a significant disconnect exists between lean thinking and demands of stakeholders that impacts the value of an organization, and only middle-level managers bring balance and awareness of both streams of thought. An empirical instrument has been developed to balance the stakeholder salience criteria with the lean thinking variants. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision-making; First-line; Lean thinking; Middle-level and senior managers; Organization type, size and location; Stakeholder salience","Data mining; Decision theory; Location; Managers; Waste management; Design/methodology/approach; Geographic location; Making decision; Management level; Middle managers; Organization sizes; Senior managers; Stakeholder theory; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079699116

The impediments challenging financial prosperity in the continent are numerous and have resulted in prolonged loss-making periods across most Latin American carriers. Breaking with this trend, Copa Airlines has been able to report double-digit net results for several years and recorded 56% of total profits earned by all Latin American carriers in 2016. This research has identified a number of Key Performance Indicators that have underpinned Copa Airlines' financial prosperity through a Product and Organisational Architecture (POA) framework analysis whose results were validated and elaborated upon by the CEO of Copa Airlines. Copa's sustained financial success was attributable to a number of factors. First, its geographical positioning has allowed it to engineer strong connectivity by coupling North and South America through its hub, which is reachable with narrowbodies to nearly all points in the Americas. Second, its low unit cost structure is akin to that of LCCs, operating a single aircraft type with high utilisation. Third, it has a uniquely low market concentration of competitors on its routes and capitalises on this by having a strong schedule with high frequencies together with outstanding punctuality. Fourth, it has a synergistic and fruitful cooperation with its hub airport at Tocumen. Finally it benefits from positive external factors such as a dollarized home economy with high GDP growth, exceptionally low unemployment and inflation rates ring-fenced with security. These pillars can be used as a reference for other Latin based airlines seeking to improve profitability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Copa airlines; Latin America; Panama; Product and organisational architecture; Profitability","air transportation; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; profitability; transportation economics; unemployment; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078929278

We investigate the relationship between VC pay and performance (rooted in principal agent theory), taking into account an array of other possible determinants. Deriving measures of VC performance is difficult as VCs are agents for various principals, and each principal may be interested in a different aspect of performance. We consider three measures of VC performance here: managerial efficiency as measured by data envelopment analysis; performance in university rankings produced by the media; the financial stability of the university. We construct a comprehensive data set, covering academic years 2009/2010 to 2016/2017, a period of considerable change in the UK higher education sector including rapidly-rising undergraduate tuition fees. Our results show that, once other possible determinants of VC pay are taken into account, the main measure of performance which affects VC pay is the one based on media rankings. Thus the agents (VCs) appear to be rewarded for delivering against this performance benchmark which is likely to be of interest to a variety of principals. This result however varies by type of university suggesting that the labour market for VCs differs by mission group. © 2019, The Author(s).","Efficiency; Executive pay; Higher education; Performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066265223

To begin to remedy this knowledge gap, we build on transactional models of stress to posit that salespeople who identify with the selling organization are less likely to experience tension and, by extension, role stress when selling to friends. Moreover, we predict that role stress may have both positive and negative consequences in a friend-selling context. We test these ideas using dyadic survey data (provided by salespeople and their customers) and find that (1) organizational identification reduces friend-selling stress, (2) the organizational identification–friend-selling stress relationship is contingent on friend-selling frequency and network size, (3) friend-selling ambiguity decreases sales performance and customer trust, and (4) friend-selling conflict has divergent consequences, leading to positive customer responses but negative salesperson outcomes. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Pi Sigma Epsilon National Educational Foundation.","friend-selling ambiguity; friend-selling conflict; organizational identification; sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074820059

This paper investigates the effects of banks' branch network changes (i.e., branch openings and branch closures) on customer omnichannel banking behavior. Using approximately 0.85 million (33 months') anonymized individual-level banking transactions from a large commercial bank in the United States, this paper shows the asymmetric effects of branch openings and branch closures on customer omnichannel banking behavior. In particular, we find that branch openings increase customers' branch transactions; however, the first branch opening leads to a migration of complex transactions to the branches, which might result in a net decrease in online banking in the short term. As consumers interact more with the physical channel, there is a gradual synergistic increase in customers' transactions via online banking as well as alternative channels due to a learning spillover effect. The learning spillover effect goes from easy online inquiries to more complex online transactions as additional branches open. On the contrary, branch closures result in a favorable migration pattern from the branch channel to online banking. This pattern, however, could be reversed once the last branch closes within the customer's residential neighborhood. Our study teases out the underlying mechanisms that drive customer omnichannel banking behavior in the context of branch openings and branch closures, and discusses the managerial implications for branch network restructuring and banking channel management.

To mediate direct competition between the two intermediaries, manufacturers adopted buyback programs to repurchase used rental cars from rental agencies and redistribute them through dealers. We investigate how the timing of buyback pricing affects manufacturers’ profitability and the intermediaries’ ordering decisions by studying two schemes: (1) a precommitted scheme in which a manufacturer precommits to a buyback price at the time of initial sale to rental agencies and (2) a postponed scheme in which a manufacturer postpones the buyback pricing decision to the time of repurchase. Academic/practical relevance: Prior research has not studied the timing of buyback pricing decisions, which is practically relevant because both precommitted and postponed schemes have been adopted by manufacturers in a range of durable-goods industries. Methodology: We used a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game between three types of firms: manufacturer, dealer, and rental agency. Results: A monopolist manufacturer earns a lower profit under the precommitted scheme than under the postponed scheme. The equilibrium buyback quantity is zero under the precommitted scheme but positive under the postponed scheme. These results can be explained by two trade-offs that only exist under the precommitted scheme. First, decreasing the buyback price increases the margin of the manufacturer’s buyback program but decreases the rental agency’s first-period order quantity. Second, increasing the first-period wholesale price offered to the dealer increases the manufacturer’s margin in the sales channel but decreases the rental agency’s first-period order quantity. When manufacturer competition in the rental market is sufficiently intense, a unique equilibrium may arise in which manufacturers choose the precommitted scheme, which maximizes the manufacturers’ profits and yields positive buyback quantity. Managerial implications: The timing of buyback pricing decisions for used durable goods critically affects the profitability of buyback programs in dual distribution channels with dealers and rental agencies. Precommitting to a buyback price may put a manufacturer at a disadvantage because of the intermediaries’ strategic adjustment of their order quantities. However, competition between manufacturers in the rental market may alleviate this disadvantage thanks to a strategic complementarity between competing manufacturers’ buyback prices. © 2019 INFORMS.","Buyback pricing; Dual distribution channels; Durable goods; Manufacturer competition","Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Profitability; Distribution channel; Managerial implications; Pricing decision; Problem definition; Sales channels; Stackelberg Games; Strategic complementarity; Whole sale prices; Distribution of goods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085072920

Drawing on European Company Survey data, the paper assesses whether establishments that employ on a fixed-term basis experience higher productivity than their competitors and stronger labour productivity improvements over time. These issues are of importance, given the recent weakness of productivity growth in many EU member countries, the steps that governments have taken to relax rules relating to the employment of fixed-term workers and the emphasis placed on contractual flexibility within the European Commission’s flexicurity agenda. The paper finds that establishments that do not use fixed-term contracts enjoy productivity advantages over those that do. Establishments that employ on a fixed-term basis but retain workers once their fixed-term contract has expired perform better than those that do not retain workers. The findings also show that establishments that pursue internal flexibility report both higher productivity than competitors and productivity increases over time. In addition, they are more likely to retain workers who have reached the end of a fixed-term contract. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","European Union; fixed-term employment; flexibility; labour utilisation; performance; productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010679741

Usually, decision-makers are using these efficiency scores for ranking the DMUs. The main drawback in this process is that the ranking based on weights obtained from the standard DEA models ignore other feasible weights, this is due to the fact that DEA may have multiple solutions for each DMU. To overcome this problem, Salo and Punkka (2011) deemed each DMU as a “Black box” and developed a mix-integer model to obtain the ranking intervals for each DMU over sets of all its feasible weights. In many real-world applications, there are DMUs that have a two-stage production system. In this paper, we extend the Salo and Punkka (2011)’s model to more common and practical applications considering the two-stage production structure. The proposed approach calculates each DMU’s ranking interval for the overall system as well as for each subsystem/sub-stage. An application for non-life insurance companies is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

In the United States, the number of hours individuals sleep per night has declined by an hour and a half per night since the 1960s. As of 2005, seventy-four percent of individuals were getting less than eight hours of sleep per night on weekdays. There are negative ramifications to the organization when employees are sleep deprived such as lost productivity, increased accident rate, and increased absenteeism. Originality/Value/Contribution of the paper: Although prior research has investigated the impact that sleep deprivation has on unique job positions (e.g., shift workers, transportation), no research has investigated how sleep impacts business-to-business sales employees. Due to the responsibilities of business-to-business sales employees, this type of position should not just be lumped in with other organizational employees. For example, business-to-business sales employees are boundary spanning employees that are responsible for generating revenue for the organization. These sales employees are also more likely to be physically, socially, and psychologically separated from the organization since they frequently work outside of the office. Because of these distinctive roles, this study examines if differences based on sleep duration exist for business-to-business sales employees for two individual and five organizational factors. The two individual factors consisted of grit and happiness while the five organizational factors consisted of perceived organizational support, perceived supervisory support, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Methodology/Approach: Data was collected from 320 business-to-business sales employees using a cross industry survey. The survey was conducted using a Qualtrics panel. Sleep duration was broken into two groups with one group consisting of business-to-business sales employees who sleep, on average, seven or more hours per night and the other group consisting of business-to-business sales employees who sleep, on average, six or less hours per night. The sleep duration groups were determined based on prior research that found adults should regularly sleep seven or more hours per night in order to support optimal health. There were one hundred thirty-four respondents who slept six hours or less and one hundred eighty-six respondents who slept seven or more hours, on average, per night. Findings: The research question developed was answered by examining the differences between means for the two individual constructs and the five key organizational constructs. Differences in sleep duration for six of the seven sales constructs. There were significant differences between those that slept seven or more hours per night from those that slept six or less for grit, perceived organizational support, perceived supervisory support, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Results found that business-to-business sales employees that slept seven or more hours per night exhibited more grit than those that slept six or less hours per night. In addition, business-to-business sales employees that slept six or less hours per night had higher perceptions of both organizational and supervisory support than those that slept seven or more hours per night. Furthermore, business-to-business sales employees that slept six or less hours per night displayed higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment than sales employees that slept seven or more hours per night. Finally, business-to-business sales employees that slept seven or more hours per night indicated higher levels of turnover intentions than sales employees that slept six or less hours per night. There were no significant differences between the two sleep groups for sales employee happiness. Although some of these results may appear to be counterintuitive, conservation of resources theory can be used to explain these findings. Research Implications: This exploratory study showcases the importance of good sleep among business-to-business sales employees. This study draws on the conservation of resources theory literature to explain the counterintuitive findings. This theory posits that individuals will retain and guard against resource depletion. Additionally, as resources become depleted, other resources are valued to a greater extent. In this study, the resource being depleted is the condition of sleep. When business-to-business sales employees experience a lower average amount of sleep per night (i.e., six hours or less), they perceive higher levels of support, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment than business-to-business sales employees who experience a higher average amount of sleep per night (i.e., seven hours or more). Although this study provides a good initial examination of how sleep impacts sales organizations, this study also highlights the need for additional business-to-business sales employee sleep research. This is the first study that has examined how sleep duration impacts business-to-business sales employees. Practical Implications: This study is important to sales research because it highlights the impact that poor sleep of business-to-business sales employees has on the organization. For sales organizations, we provide guidance on ways a sales organization can help promote healthy sleep for their business-to-business sales employees. Some examples of guidance provided can be categorized into four primary categories. These categories include (1) proper sleep education, (2) sales management training, (3) creating a sleep friendly workplace environment, and (4) creating specific workplace policies to minimize sleep disturbances such as setting reasonable work hours and sleep accommodating travel schedules. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","grit; job satisfaction; organizational commitment; Sales; sleep; support; turnover intentions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078478741

This nascent practice differs from ordinary peer-to-peer lending in that lenders, to make sound investment decisions, need to process additional information other than basic loan attributes. We examine how lender behavior of investing in real-estate-secured loans is shaped by information that is particularly relevant in such an emerging market. We collect and analyze the data from a large lending-based real estate crowdfunding platform, where each loan is secured by either a mortgage (a mortgage-secured or MS loan) or a borrower's own house (a house-secured or HS loan). Our analysis reveals that lender decisions of how fast to invest and how much to invest are influenced by both on-platform and off-platform information. For on-platform information, we find that lenders as a whole prefer HS loans to MS loans, as reflected in quicker and larger lending transactions. Experienced lenders tend to invest more aggressively, in both time and amount, but exhibit a weaker preference for HS loans as compared with their inexperienced counterparts. As to off-platform information, our results show that a rise in housing prices is associated with quicker investment decisions, and this association is found to be even stronger on HS loans. Further, when stock market volatility is large, lenders tend to slow down their investment behavior; however, we find such a tendency weaker on MS loans. This research contributes to the literature by establishing relationships between crowdfunding activities, housing prices and stock market performance. Our findings also provide implications for managers and platform designers who desire to stimulate and leverage the fundraising momentum. © 2020 INFORMS.","Collateral; Crowdfunding; Housing prices; P2P lending; Real estate; Stock market","Commerce; Costs; Crowdsourcing; Financial markets; Housing; Emerging markets; Housing prices; Investment decisions; Peer-to-peer lending; Real estate; Stock market performance; Stock market volatility; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092941019

We examine one potential lever for reducing the provision of discretionary services: “justification”—an otherwise non-value-added process step that introduces process friction by forcing workers to explain the rationale for requesting an optional service. We exploit the presence—and absence—of a justification step in the ultrasound (US) ordering process at two emergency departments (EDs). We find that patients with abdominal pain are less than half as likely to receive an US when there is a justification step compared to when there is not. Additionally, we find a spillover effect: other diagnostic tests are also ordered less frequently. The decrease in testing reduces the average length of stay of the patients, and reduces testing costs by more than $200,000, with no decrease in quality. We show that two mechanisms underlie these results: (a) justification reduces clinicians' available time, and (b) justification forces clinicians to reflect on a patient's need for service. Our paper contributes to recent theory on friction and reflection as drivers of efficiency in services. We show that justification can serve as an effective lever for reducing medical tests—and costs—without negatively impacting quality. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","behavioral operations; health care; medical cost; performance improvement; worker discretion","Diagnosis; Efficiency; Emergency rooms; Friction; Health care; Average length of stays; Behavioral operations; Diagnostic tests; Emergency departments; performance improvement; Service provisions; Spillover effects; worker discretion; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063665815

We collected and utilized a comprehensive panel data set that combines information on restaurants’ deal offerings (Groupon or LivingSocial) with their Yelp review details. Although demonstrating a negative main effect of daily deals on a restaurant’s monthly average ratings, we worked to uncover the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the mediating role of consumers’ postconsumption perception. Our mediation analyses show that daily deals are associated with the reduction of both consumers’ perceived food quality and perceived service quality as revealed in review texts, which leads to subsequent declines in a restaurant’s online ratings. We further noted and studied two types of reviews that existed during the deal-redemption period: (1) reviews that mentioned daily deals (DD Reviews) and (2) reviews that did not mention daily deals (NDD Reviews). NDD Reviews are usually from regular customers, whereas DD Reviews are likely from a different base of customers, deal users. Our separate analyses demonstrate differential mediation processes between DD Reviews and NDD Reviews. For DD Reviews, both perceived food and service quality had mediation roles, suggesting a mismatch effect. That is, daily deals attract discount-focused consumers, including new customers, who are less likely to appreciate the food or service and, therefore, leave a negative review. In contrast, for NDD Reviews, only perceived service quality had a mediation role, suggesting a negative externality effect. That is, the large volume of deal redemptions by deal users may induce a longer waiting time (to be seated and/or served) and, thus, reduced perceived service quality for regular customers. These results deepen our understanding of the impact of daily deals on business online reputation and provide important practical guidance to both local retailers and daily deal platforms.

Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we posit that firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the later stages (i.e., the IT delivery stage and IT change stage) of the IT lifecycle are better able to translate their IT investment into revenue than firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the early stage (i.e., IT investment planning stage) of the IT lifecycle. To test our theory, we leverage archival data from more than 120 firms in India that differ in terms of where in the IT lifecycle they focused on IT–business alignment as the key priority. We find that the positive relationship between IT investment and firm revenue is stronger for firms that focus on IT delivery alignment or IT change alignment than for firms that focus on IT investment planning alignment. In addition, we find that at higher levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT change alignment or IT delivery alignment have higher revenue than firms that focus on IT investment planning alignment, whereas at low levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT investment planning alignment outperform firms that focus on IT delivery alignment or IT change alignment. Overall, the study contributes by documenting that IT–business alignment at the IT delivery stage and IT change stage of the IT lifecycle are more critical for leveraging IT investment for firm performance than IT–business alignment at the IT investment planning stage.

Even when the platform's aggregate levels of supply and demand remain fixed, we establish that the platform's ability to use its design levers to manage the availability of supply over time yields significant value. We study two such levers, each using the platform's availability of supply as a means to incentivize participation from buyers who decide strategically when/how often to participate. First, the platform's listing policy sets the ending times of incoming auctions (hence, the frequency of market clearing). Exploiting a natural experiment, we illustrate that consolidating auctions' ending times to certain weekdays increases the platform's revenues by 7.3% mainly by inducing a higher level of bidder participation. The second lever is a recommendation system that can be used to reveal information about real-time market thickness to potential bidders. The optimization of these levers highlights a novel trade-off. Namely, when the platform consolidates auctions' ending times, more bidders may participate in the marketplace (demand-side competition); but ultimately auctions for substitutable goods cannibalize one another (supply-side competition). To optimize these design decisions, we estimate a structural model that endogenizes bidders' dynamic behavior, that is, their decisions on whether/how often to participate in the marketplace and how much to bid. We find that appropriately designing a recommendation system yields an additional revenue increase (on top of the benefits obtained by optimizing the platform's listing policy) by reducing supply-side cannibalization and altering the composition of participating bidders. © 2020 INFORMS.","Market clearing; Market thickness; Matching supply with demand; Natural experiment; Online markets; Structural estimation","Commerce; Competition; Economic and social effects; Fixed platforms; Business to business; Design decisions; Dynamic behaviors; Natural experiment; Potential bidders; Real-time market; Structural modeling; Supply and demand; Recommender systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097285692

Projectification, as described by Li (2016), is understood as a process through which plans for systematic long-term change collapse into incremental, simplified technical solutions. These proposals often fail to address complex socio-economic problems and political-economic contexts, allowing large-scale deforestation drivers to persist. We analyze whether Indonesia is on track toward transformational change or is conversely locked into projectification. We construct our analysis using results from a long-term study comprising surveys in 2012, 2015, and 2019 analyzing the evolving role of REDD+ in Indonesian forest governance. Combining qualitative and quantitative analysis, we examine changes in (i) discursive practices and policy beliefs; (ii) institutions and power relations; and (iii) informal networking relationships. Our findings show that despite high hopes and some promising developments, REDD+ has not yet fully succeeded in creating transformational change. Ideas of REDD+ remain focused on efficiency and technical aspects of implementation and do not question business as usual and the current political economic conditions favoring deforestation. The changing structure of the REDD+ policy network and exchanges between actors and groups over time suggest government actors and large funding organizations are becoming increasingly dominant, potentially indicating a return to established patterns of project-based governance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Policy network analysis; Projectification; REDD+; Transformational change","Economics; Forestry; Changing structures; Economic condition; Forest degradation; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Reducing emissions; Socio-economic problems; Technical aspects; Technical solutions; Deforestation; Deforestation; Economics; Forestry; Indonesian; Patterns; Processes; Quantitative Analysis; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092173212

Using coopetitive-based view, this study examines the antecedents and drivers of infrastructure sharing (IS) among local and multinational mobile network operators (MNOs) in Africa. Based on 21 interviews with different stakeholders in seven sub-Sahara African (SSA) countries, we develop an integrative framework of industry/market, technological, and institutional factors that affect IS between MNOs. We find evidence of institutional factors shaping the impact of the industry structure and technological factors on firms’ propensity to engage in coopetitive strategies. There is evidence that in contexts with low-level IS, inadequate regulatory interventions mean that the existing market conditions are reproduced, leading to further competitive behaviours from MNOs. For high- level IS, MNOs tend to engage in further coopetitive strategies through strategic learning and cooperate to resolve technological incompatibilities and engage in standards settings. We extend the existing scholarly works on coopetition and IS literature by providing an in-depth understanding of the obstacles faced by MNOs in adopting IS. The study further highlights that IS requires a shift from the competitive-based logic to a dynamic, coopetitive one, which is nonetheless challenging to achieve with limited institutional capacity and support. © 2020","Africa; Coopetition; Digital divide; Infrastructure sharing; Mobile telecoms","Technological forecasting; Dynamic business environment; In-depth understanding; Infrastructure sharing; Institutional capacities; Integrative framework; Mobile network operators; Regulatory interventions; Technological factors; Economic and social effects; industrial structure; integrated approach; market conditions; mobile communication; multinational enterprise; regulatory approach; stakeholder; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089727434

In doing so, these oppositional categories, especially craft-based ones, emphasize their size (small), ownership (independence), and production methods (traditional) as important identity codes—critical for maintaining their distinctiveness from the incumbent category. However, we lack theoretical insights into how oppositional category members respond as (former) members defect by joining the incumbent category they challenge and ideologically oppose. Therefore, taking an identity lens, our study explores the following research question: As members sell to incumbents, how do the remaining members of the oppositional category attempt to maintain the distinctiveness of the collective identity? Our findings reveal incumbents' acquisitions of oppositional members open the opportunity to elevate the importance of ownership (independence) as a distinctive identity code. Managerial Summary: Craft categories often emerge by opposing large, dominant corporations. This David versus Goliath mentality helps establish distinct differences between the two groups of firms. However, as owners of the craft organizations grow and sell (to the opposition), this can erode the core attributes that originally made the craft category distinct. We find that as craft brewers sold their breweries to mass producers it did just that—led to considerable confusion in what constitutes a “craft brewery.” However, the craft brewing collective rallied together to identify “independence” as the core feature of craft brewers—one that cannot be bought or copied by the opposition—in hopes they can maintain their distinctiveness from mass producers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","craft beer industry; craft-based organizations; market categories; oppositional identity; qualitative methods","Breweries; Collective identity; Core features; Identity codes; Production methods; Research questions; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087216513

The novelty of the study is that for the first time this kind of analysis has been carried out for the manufacturing industry in Russia, whose economy is characterized by the instability (crisis), external sanctions, and the internal trend for import substitution. Using a panel data on 6134 enterprises operating across several industries in Russia over the period of 2012–2016, the article suggests that generally production efficiency and scale efficiency positively affect profitability, whereas the share of borrowed capital, share of fixed assets and rising interest rates exert negative effects. The contribution of external financial factors is minimal, except for foreign and jointly owned firms. Production efficiency has a particularly pronounced effect for the automotive industry, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and in the metal industry. In contrast, in the chemical, electrical and optical manufacturing, and in food processing industries, internal financial factors emerge as a powerful predictor of performance. Firm ownership does not exert a significant effect on the relationship between the variables of interest when the share of borrowed funds is below 50%. When the share of borrowed capital exceeds 50%, internal financial factors emerge as a particularly prominent predictor of profitability. © 2020, The Author(s).","Countries with unstable economies; Enterprises in Russia; Foreign and joint ownership; Production efficiency; Profitability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078904523

Racial biases are particularly worrisome in healthcare, where underrepresented minorities suffer disparities in access to care, quality of care, and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we examine the role clinical decision support systems (CDSS) play in attenuating systematic biases among black patients, relative to white patients, in rates of amputation and revascularization stemming from diabetes mellitus. Using a panel of inpatient data and a difference-in-difference approach, results suggest that CDSS adoption significantly shrinks disparities in amputation rates across white and black patients—with no evidence that this change is simply delaying eventual amputations. Results suggest that this effect is driven by changes in treatment care protocols that match patients to appropriate specialists, rather than altering within physician decision making. These findings highlight the role information systems and digitized patient care can play in promoting unbiased decision making by structuring and standardizing care procedures.

The firm knows neither the primary demand distribution for each product nor the customers’ substitution probabilities between products a priori, and it needs to learn such information from sales data on the fly. One challenge in this problem is that the firm cannot distinguish between primary demand and substitution (overflow) demand from the sales data of any product, and lost sales are not observable. To circumvent these difficulties, we construct learning stages with each stage consisting of a cyclic exploration scheme and a benchmark exploration interval. The benchmark interval allows us to isolate the primary demand information from the sales data, and then this information is used against the sales data from the cyclic exploration intervals to estimate substitution probabilities. Because raising the inventory level helps obtain primary demand information but hinders substitution demand information, inventory decisions have to be carefully balanced to learn them together. We show that our learning algorithm admits a worst-case regret rate that (almost) matches the theoretical lower bound, and numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs very well.

Current boundary-work literature does not fully account for the processual, dispersed, and political dynamics triggered by such efforts. To address this shortcoming, this article builds on an ethnographic study of a professional care provider’s attempts to engage local citizens within one of its care homes. We analyze how actors negotiate the parameters of outsider engagement – that is, how they interactively (re-)erect and (re-)efface boundaries between actors (Who is engaged?), issues (What is their engagement about?), and positions of authority (Does local engagement affect central decision-making?). We contribute to extant theorizing by, first, explicitly scrutinizing boundary work’s temporal and spatial dynamics. Testifying to the importance of analyzing temporal sequences, we show how attempts at transcending boundaries intensified boundary work on multiple organizational platforms. Paradoxically, inclusionary efforts evoked exclusionary effects (and vice versa) as actors came to contest and, eventually, redefine ‘appropriate’ insider–outsider relations. Second, our analysis highlights how the political effectiveness of an inclusive and non-hierarchical approach still, ironically, depends on ongoing hierarchical support and managerial enforcement. Third, our article makes a case for the adoption of long-term, multi-sited methodologies when studying the everyday dynamics of boundary-work processes. © The Author(s) 2019.","boundary work; Boundaryless organization; organization-environment; organizational boundaries; stakeholder engagement","adoption; article; decision making; human; stakeholder engagement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076454006

Considering the recent involvement of young adults in environmental activism, consumption behaviour of young adults in the North East of Scotland, an oil-based community, presents essential research interest to understand whether young adults often contemplate the consequences of their lifestyle. Design/methodology/approach: The authors explored the perceptions of ten purposive recruited young adults using semi-structured interviews to understand factors underpinning consumer's decision-making towards ethical food products. Findings: The study reveals three key factors influencing ethical food consumption behaviour among young adults. The findings show that personal health and well-being are the main reasons why consumers engage in ethical food consumption. Also, it is observed that information facilitates decision-making by raising awareness regarding the social, environmental and health consequences of food production and consumption. Further, the findings show that situational attributes, such as product price and product availability, are creating dissonance when engaging in ethical food consumption. Originality/value: This study contributes to sustainability research and the ongoing debate on consumerism by exploring ethical food consumption behaviour and highlights the need to address situational challenges, such as product price and availability. The study suggests that interventions to address current consumption patterns should also emphasise the social and personal benefits of food consumption rather than the environmental benefits that have been the focus of prior research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behaviour; Consumer; Consumption; Ethical; Food; Organic; Supply chain; Sustainability; Vegetarianism","adult; article; awareness; clinical article; consumer; decision making; exploratory research; female; food industry; food intake; human; human experiment; lifestyle; male; motivation; perception; Scotland; semi structured interview; vegetarian diet; wellbeing; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084198442

Even though GDPR leads toward many advantages for the data subjects it turned out to be a significant challenge. Organizations need to implement long and complex changes to become GDPR compliant. Data subjects are empowered with new rights, which, however, they need to become aware of. GDPR compliance is a challenging matter for the relevant stakeholders calls for a software platform that can support their needs. The aim of data governance for supporting GDPR (DEFeND) EU project is to deliver such a platform. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process, within the DEFeND EU project, for eliciting and analyzing requirements for such a complex platform. Design/methodology/approach: The platform needs to satisfy legal and privacy requirements and provide functionalities that data controllers request for supporting GDPR compliance. Further, it needs to satisfy acceptance requirements, for assuring that its users will embrace and use the platform. In this paper, the authors describe the methodology for eliciting and analyzing requirements for such a complex platform, by analyzing data attained by stakeholders from different sectors. Findings: The findings provide the process for the DEFeND platform requirements’ elicitation and an indicative sample of those. The authors also describe the implementation of a secondary process for consolidating the elicited requirements into a consistent set of platform requirements. Practical implications: The proposed software engineering methodology and data collection tools (i.e. questionnaires) are expected to have a significant impact for software engineers in academia and industry. Social implications: It is reported repeatedly that data controllers face difficulties in complying with the GDPR.

Based on our evaluations, we propose innovation policies tailored to take into account the diverse economic environments of the many countries in our study. Applying multidirectional efficiency analysis on data from the Global Innovation Index, we obtain separate efficiency scores for each innovation input and output. We then estimate different sensitivities for each country, by applying partial least squares on explanatory and response matrices which are determined by the nearest neighbors of the country under consideration. The findings reveal substantial asymmetries with respect to innovation efficiencies and sensitivities, which is indicative of the diversity of national innovation systems. Considering these two dimensions in combination, we outline three policy directions that can be followed, offering a platform for better-informed decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Innovation policy; Multi-directional efficiency analysis; Nearest neighbors","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Least squares approximations; Composite indicators; Economic environment; Efficiency analysis; Innovation efficiency; Innovation policies; National innovation systems; Nearest neighbors; Partial least square (PLS); Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081936308

Nevertheless, the users of machine learning usually find that these sophisticated techniques could incur a high level of tensions caused by the selection of the appropriate size of the training data set among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic way of resolving such tensions by examining practical examples of predicting popularity and sentiment of posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs on Mashable, news on Google and Yahoo, the US house survey, and Bitcoin prices. Interesting results show that for the case of big data, using around 20% of the full sample often leads to a better prediction accuracy than opting for the full sample. Our conclusion is found to be consistent across a series of experiments.

It uses data collected from participant observation and interviews of a cycling tourist group in China. The findings indicate that after building a social circle in an online community, the members of the “community” build trust by: identifying travel companions’ attitudes, values, knowledge, and experiences to build dispositional trust; identifying companions’ preferences, activities, or the patterns of cycling behavior to build institutional trust; identifying companions’ cycling experiences, occupations, and hobbies to build interpersonal trust. After the identification of travel companions and trust has developed, online community members make the decision to travel together as companions and their online social circle becomes a regulated group without hierarchy.

However, the literature has been silent on how IFPs can optimise the business through the optimisation of the impawn rate. This study examines the role of the optimal impawn rate in the inventory financing business. The key to setting the optimal impawn rate is first evaluating default probability and then incorporating this into the profit function. We use a data-driven approach to explore the copula model in setting the optimal impawn rate. Through numerical analysis, we find that the Clayton canonical vine copula has a better performance for the prediction of default probability than the multivariate normal distribution (MVN) and can thus be used to evaluate default probability. In addition, we uncover that setting multiple impawn rates for different collaterals allows inventory financing to yield a higher profit. Further, although the interest rate, industrial impawn rate, and optimal impawn rate have strong effects on inventory financing profit, interestingly, the relationship between them is marginally diminishing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Canonical vine copula; Impawn rate optimisation; Inventory financing; Inventory financing provider","Competition; Normal distribution; Profitability; Canonical vine copula; Data-driven approach; Default probabilities; Interest rates; Inventory financings; Multi-variate normal distributions; Optimisations; Profit function; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078442893

Given today’s stochastic nature of supply and the dynamic nature of demand, the different supply activities along with the chain exhibit a multi-state behaviour increasing the complexity of their risk assessment. The new approach utilizes the universal generating function (UGF) to model the different suppliers’ echelons with their various supply risk levels along all the stages of the supply chain as a multi-state risk system. The developed model was successfully implemented to assess the supply risk in a multi-state strawberry supply chain and outperformed classical approaches. Results from the case study and the validation analysis illustrated the ability of the new approach to capture the various supply levels with their associated risks leading to more informative risk assessment process. Furthermore, the developed model improved the visibility for the purchasing managers downstream in terms of the different trade-offs between supply levels and their risks as well as some financial thresholds. The new multi-state approach contributes to the emerging supply chain risk assessment trend by offering a more realistic modelling method to capture the risk of all available supply levels along the delivery chain. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","risk assessment; Supply chain risk management; universal generating function","Economic and social effects; Risk management; Risk perception; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Assessment process; Classical approach; Realistic modelling; Supply chain risk; Supply chain risk management; Universal generating functions; Universal generating functions (UGF); Validation analysis; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075456766

Yet walking may already be part of the change taking place, as technological innovation and behaviour come together. This paper considers the potential significance of pedestrian navigation that has been placed in the hands of smartphone users, referring to it as ‘Walking as a Service’ (WaaS). For individuals physically able to, walking can provide a number of positive attributes including independence, reliability, flexibility, exercise and affordability. Such attributes may compare favourably with other means of transport for shorter journeys. Yet in spite of this it is often not the mode of choice. One of its limitations can be the cognitive challenge – when faced with the unfamiliar - of judging how long a journey could take on foot and determining how to navigate to the destination. Google Maps Navigation now addresses this with what appears to be ever improving attention to usability. Audio-visual assistance ‘holds your hand’ on your journey and keeps track of how far you have left to go and the estimated time needed. With a focus on the UK, the paper explores the prospects for, and place of, WaaS in the future of mobility, also highlighting an apparent sharp increase in average walking trip rate from 2015 to 2018. It draws out a distinction between the business model of Mobility as a Service (MaaS - which sells access to mobility) and that of WaaS (which sells access to geography and consumers) and puts forward the WaaS Circle of Virtue wherein WaaS is able to support sustainability and profitability. © 2020 The Author","MaaS; Pedestrian navigation; TDM; WaaS; Walking; Wayfinding","Binary alloys; Potassium alloys; Business modeling; Google maps; Mobility systems; Pedestrian navigation; Sharp increase; Technological innovation; Walking trips; Uranium alloys; future prospect; mobility; pedestrian; profitability; sustainability; transportation system; travel behavior; travel time; walking; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085560690

An ideal match would both target items to agents with the worst outside options and match them to items for which they have high value. Our first finding is that two common approaches-using independent lotteries for each item and using a waitlist in which agents lose priority when they reject an offer-lead to identical outcomes in equilibrium. Both approaches encourage agents to accept items that are marginal fits. We show that the quality of the match can be improved by using a common lottery for all items. If participation costs are negligible, a common lottery is equivalent to several other mechanisms, such as limiting participants to a single lottery, using a waitlist in which offers can be rejected without punishment, or using artificial currency. However, when there are many agents with low need, there is an unavoidable trade-off between matching and targeting.

We find that the estimated value of market and non-market contributions of older adults in the sample countries in Europe and the US sum to the equivalent of 7.3% of gross domestic product, while older adults make up 24% and 21% of the European and US population, respectively. In addition, notable variation exists in the composition of older adults’ economic contributions by age group, national setting, and gender—with a significant proportion of overall value generated from PNMA when monetized in relation to market activities. Regarding retirement policy, we find at the country level that the value generated from increased employment may be offset by the loss of value from decreased PNMA and that the impact of retirement policy on overall productivity depends on the ratio of market to non-market productivity in a country. Finally, we find that severe but common health shocks such as heart attacks, strokes, and the onset of cancer affect both market activities and PNMA appreciably across countries and genders, with an overall greater reduction in market activities by males and in PNMA by females. Taken together, we show that PNMA comprises a substantial share of older adults’ productive contributions and argue that it should be considered in policy discussions regarding retirement age, pension taxes, and healthy aging. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Europe; Non-market activity; Older adults; Productivity; Retirement policy; US","adult; aging population; market conditions; participatory approach; productivity; retirement; social policy; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083402821

Macroeconomic stability is measured based on five Maastricht Criteria's variables namely inflation rate, real exchange rate, government debt, fiscal deficit and real interest rate. The study employs dynamic models on the panel data. We find that macroeconomic stability has significant effects on financial development in the region. Specifically, inflation rate, real exchange rate and fiscal deficit have negative effects, while the effects of government debt and real interest rate are positive. The implication of this study is that macroeconomic stability variables are determinants of financial development. Hence, developing economies should strive to achieve macroeconomic stability in order to drive financial development, with a view to achieving sustainable economic development. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","developing economies; economic growth; financial development; Macroeconomic stability","developing world; economic development; economic growth; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; real exchange rate; regional development; sustainable development; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074200062

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) unit root test to check the order of integration of data series. Afterward, the authors use the ordinary least square method to determine the spillover of international oil prices to the stock markets of GCC countries while accounting for the time-varying volatility of oil and stock market returns through the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity. Then, the Johansen (1991) cointegration test is used to determine the long-run equilibrium relationship. Finally, the Granger (1969) causality test is used to determine the short-run causal effects between oil and the stock markets returns of GCC countries. Findings: The findings indicate that the stock markets of GCC countries are efficient and respond significantly to international oil prices and evidence of high volatility associated with oil returns. Originality/value: Investors and portfolio managers should consider the association between international oil prices and GCC stock returns when allocating their funds for diversification strategy. Moreover, policymakers should better understand the behavior of local stock markets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ARIMA; Causality; Co-integration; Dynamic regression; Financial sector; Fossil fuel; GARCH; GCC countries; Oil prices; Stock market; Time series analysis","Commerce; Costs; Investments; Least squares approximations; Co-integration tests; Design/methodology/approach; Diversification strategies; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Gulf Cooperation Council; Ordinary least square methods; Portfolio managers; Stock market index; Crude oil price",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078985118

This paper empirically demonstrates which employee engagement dimension(s) act as the strongest dimension to enhance the levels of employee engagement and consequently organisational effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative approach, specifically a survey design, using a questionnaire to collect data. Regression analysis was applied to predict the impact of the employee engagement dimensions on the level of employee engagement in organisations and the impact of online/social media, as part of communication, on employee engagement. Findings: The statistical analyses indicate that the dimensions organisational strategy and implementation, organisational commitment and team commitment are significant predictors of employee engagement. On-line/social media has a negative effect on employee engagement. However, according to the results, communication in organisations can be improved, especially by using online/social media more effectively. Research limitations/implications: This includes low response rate from some groups. Practical implications: The importance of secondary general management tasks, particularly motivation and communication, in mobilising employees to cooperate in pursuing organisational goals, became apparent. This study reflects the adverse effect of a lack of leadership and management skills, and ineffective use of online/social media on organisational performance, as reported in academic and practitioner research. Regardless, practitioners can apply the levers of motivation, via structural dimensions of organisation, to activate psychological presence which drives employee engagement and in turn facilitates strategy implementation and consequently organisational effectiveness. Scholars can modify their research agendas by investigating the “(un)availability” of human resources to improve organisational effectiveness. Social implications: The costs of disengaged employees are high, in terms of productivity losses and the performance gap, with adverse consequences for society. Originality/value: Employee engagement as a driver of strategy implementation is an overlooked area of research. This study offers a better explanation of employee engagement as a mechanism to improve strategy implementation, thus reducing the performance gap, and consequently waste. Employee engagement engenders employee support to pursue organisational goals, in a coordinated system of cooperation, and is produced by the structural dimensions of organisation, the parameters within which psychological presence is activated. Psychological presence drives employee engagement which enables employees to be available to implement strategy to achieve organisational goals and thus organisational effectiveness. Engagement at a broader level than individual is significant. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Communication; Employee engagement; Motivation; Organisational commitment; Psychological presence; Secondary general management tasks; Strategy implementation; Team commitment","Digital storage; Human resource management; Motivation; Regression analysis; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Employee engagement; Exploratory studies; Organisational effectiveness; Organisational performance; Quantitative approach; Strategy implementations; Structural dimensions; Strategic planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081290377

Such macro-level BIM maturity indicators drive policy and the institutional imperatives for smooth adoption of BIM at the micro-level (within organisations). The Italian BIM landscape is slowly progressing with several initiatives towards meeting European Union (EU) directives. It, however, remains unclear which macro-level implementation factors are most relevant to organisations in their BIM implementation. Furthermore, there is a dearth of studies exploring the relevance of proposed macro-level BIM implementation factors to BIM implementation at the micro-level. In addressing this gap, this study uses the Italian scenario to explore the role of macro-BIM maturity factors on facilitating micro-level implementation effectiveness in design firms. To achieve this aim, an exploratory study of the literature was conducted to identify macro-level factors required at the national level for BIM implementation and ascertain which of those factors are most important to design firms through a questionnaire survey of professionals within design firms, which yielded 162 responses. The research found that steps are being undertaken to improve Italy’s macro-BIM maturity with professionals having an overall good degree of awareness and positive attitude towards BIM. Based on statistical analysis, the most important macro-level initiatives to design firms is the need for embedding BIM into education curriculum as well as availability of standard deliverables and components such as BIM objects, libraries and standards that regulate their development and use. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","BIM; capability; design; Italy; maturity","Availability; Design; Surveys; capability; Conceptual model; Education curriculums; Exploratory studies; Italy; maturity; Positive attitude; Questionnaire surveys; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082467790

Higher inventory levels might allow more attractive displays and thus, increase sales in addition to avoiding stockouts. Academic/ practical relevance: By knowing how inventory levels affect consumer choices, retailers can adjust their inventory levels so as to maximize sales or profits. Methodology: We develop a choice model where product demand is indeed affected by inventory and controls for product and store heterogeneity, seasonality, promotions, and potential unobservable shocks in each market. We empirically test the model with daily traffic, inventory, and sales data from a large retailer at the store-day-product level. Results: We find that the impact of inventory level on sales is positive and highly significant, even in situations of extremely high service level. The magnitude of this effect is large: each 1% increase in product-level inventory at the store increases sales by 0.62% on average. This supports the idea that inventory has a strong role in helping customers choose a particular product within the assortment. Managerial implications: We describe how a retailer should optimally decide its inventory levels within a category and describe the properties of the optimal solution. Applying such optimization to our data set yields consistent and significant revenue improvements compared with policies that ignore the impact of inventory on sales. © 2019 INFORMS","Assortment planning; Choice models; Fashion retailing; Inventory management","Industrial management; Operations research; Consumer choice; Fashion retailing; Inventory levels; Managerial implications; Optimal solutions; Problem definition; Product inventory; Retail settings; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092670799

One promising approach refers to crowdsourcing systems that hold the potential to solve any kind of problem – notably wicked ones. Crowdsourced solutions work well because crowds exchange knowledge from different domains – a concept known as “cross-fertilisation.” Thereby, the “facilitator” of a crowdsourcing system is the primary decision maker when it comes to specifying and managing the crowd. The facilitator's role includes actively managing cross-fertilisation. However, in the light of technological advancements and large-scale data, facilitation proves difficult – especially in one particular type of crowdsourcing – crowdsolving. Thus, academia recently called for relieving some burden of facilitators and started developing tools for supporting or automated facilitation. Yet, the focus of existing tools is not on fostering the innermost core of crowdsolving endeavours – cross-fertilisation. By taking a design science perspective, we propose design principles and design guidelines for a decision-support tool aiding facilitators to (a) set the boundary conditions for, (b) measure, and (c) facilitate cross-fertilisation. We evaluate feasibility and value added of the abstract design by applying it to different crowdsolving platforms including a prototypical implementation and qualitative evaluation by facilitators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Collective intelligence; Cross-fertilisation; Crowdsolving; Design science; Facilitation","Decision making; Decision support systems; Design; Knowledge management; Collective intelligences; Crowdsolving; Design science; Facilitation; Fertilisation; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081687255

We explore this issue using a large field experiment that incentivized employees of a Fortune 500 company to use their workplace gym. We compare the effectiveness of a treatment with constant incentives over 8 weeks to two treatments that varied incentives over time. One variable treatment featured front-loaded incentives, which could, in theory, help procrastinators overcome startup costs to joining an incentive program. We find, however, that the front-loaded incentive did not increase participation on the extensive margin relative to the constant incentive and was less effective in sustaining exercise over time. The second variable incentive was designed to leverage short-term habit formation by turning incentives on and off over a longer period of time. This novel sporadic incentive showed slightly stronger effects than the constant incentive. We discuss how the nature of habit-formation processes affects the relative benefits of consistent versus periodic incentives.

Our results suggest that more advanced techniques yield substantially larger positive effects (FDI spillovers). When placing more weight on estimates that solve important identification problems in the literature (such as using data on existing linkages between firms instead of approximations based on input-output tables), we find that, as of 2018, a 10-percentage-point increase in foreign presence is likely to lift the productivity of domestic firms by 11%.

This is a bi-directional exchange where the buyer and supply network each act as the sender and receiver of knowledge. Prior research has however largely focused on the knowledge recipient only. We consider both sender and recipient using two key dynamic capabilities related to knowledge transfer: (i) desorptive capacity, which enables the safe transfer of knowledge from the sender; and, (ii) absorptive capacity, which enables the acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge by the recipient. Using the concept of ‘fit’, we investigate whether organisations strengthen supply chain competence when their desorptive capacity exceeds that of their supply network's (positive misfit) and consider the moderating role of the organisation’s and supply network’s absorptive capacity. Multiple regression analysis of survey data from 250 firms identifies an inverted U-shaped relationship between positive desorptive capacity misfit and supply chain competence.

Before running portfolio optimizations, we first test normality of return distributions of selected assets including private- and public-equity timberlands, private-equity commercial real estate, public REITs, S&P 500 index, short- and long-term government bonds, and long-term corporate bonds. Given that returns are not normally distributed, we use conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in lieu of standard deviation as the risk measure and investigate optimal asset allocations under the mean-CVaR framework. Results reveal that weight on timberland in the mixed-asset portfolio does vary with time for both the lowest risk portfolio and the tangency portfolio due to its changing return-to-risk ratio and correlation with other assets. In particular, private-equity timberland asset plays a more significant role in the constrained optimal portfolios invested by 15-year closed-end funds maturing in recent years. © 2020","Institutional investments; Linear programing; Portfolio optimization; Real estate; TIMOs","Financial data processing; Linear programming; Normal distribution; Risk assessment; Value engineering; Institutional investments; Linear programing; Portfolio optimization; Real estate; TIMOs; Investments; Averages; Errors; Linear Programing; Maturing; Risk Assessment; Standards; Test Methods; Windows",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081010408

In this study, we investigate the relationship between online media activities and movie sales. In particular, this paper examines how media coverage (online news and social media posts) and consumer engagement (information search and reading) affect the sales of original movies and sequels in the opening week. By applying the panel vector auto-regression (PVAR) method, we found that online news, social media posts, and information reading were positively related to future sales of originals and sequels, while information search was not a significant predictor of movie sales for originals. Media coverage had a stronger and more durable marketing effect on the sales of originals, and consumer engagement had a stronger effect on the sales of sequels. Compared with social media posts, online news had a higher promoting effect on consumer engagement for sequels. Further, online media coverage and consumer engagement also had mutual effects on each other. This study suggests that managers of movie studios and theaters should apply different channel strategies and allocate different resources for originals and sequels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer engagement; Media coverage; Movie sales; Panel vector auto-regression","Commerce; Information retrieval; Motion pictures; Social networking (online); Auto regression; Channel strategies; Consumer engagement; Information search; Marketing effect; Media coverage; Movie industry; Promoting effect; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079739480

Developing the networks and infrastructure required to make these processes economically viable depends on high quality information about the volume and characteristics of food waste requiring treatment. Traditionally, food waste generation estimates have come from limited empirical studies and theoretical tools that predict the volume of food waste that will result from different types and intensities of economic activity. Resulting estimations are quick and don't require extensive investment to collect, but only provide single, static snapshots of expected waste generation. In reality, however, food waste would vary depending on the season, geography, and type and magnitude of the waste generating activity. This study provides an analysis of this potential variability using empirical data from commercial and institutional food waste generators in New York State and a publicly available database of food waste estimates. Results show that 57 % of food waste generated within the region comes from only 4 % of commercial facilities. Moreover, statewide generation varies monthly by approximately 37 % and significantly across different regions due to concentrations of facility locations. Study findings underscore how policy or facility siting decisions based on a single, static food waste estimation may not capture the full complexity of food waste management. Future work can improve common estimation approaches and methods for collecting empirical data to support robust policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Food waste; Generation estimates; Geospatial; Policy implications; Variability","Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Public policy; Sustainable development; Food waste; Generation estimates; Geo-spatial; Policy implications; Variability; Waste treatment; decision making; economic activity; food waste; landfill; policy approach; pollution policy; sustainability; waste disposal; waste management; article; food waste; geography; investment; New York; season; siting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077440405

This can result in poor capacity utilization as they expend effort on tasks that are not successfully resolved. A deeper understanding of task-related uncertainty can help the firm optimize effort allocation across tasks by implementing well-designed task closure policies that facilitate superior capacity utilization and capacity planning. In this article, we characterize the empirical distribution of task uncertainty and demonstrate how the resolution process affects task outcomes in project environments. Using a combination of empirical estimation, and analytical and simulation modeling, we develop insights into task-related decision-making and engineer effort allocation. Using real-world task resolution data from a software maintenance setting, we first model and estimate a beta-geometric survival distribution which indicates that the likelihood of successful task resolution substantially reduces with the time a task remains in the system. Using analytical and simulation modeling, we then examine the implications of imposing task closure policies to improve engineer effort allocation and increase system productivity. We demonstrate that adopting well-designed task closure policies can significantly improve engineer resource utilization in capacity-constrained settings without a substantial negative impact on project outcomes.

Nevertheless, women’s under-representation on decision-making positions in ICT or high-tech organizations (double gender gap) in the tourism industry has been hardly evaluated. The aim of this paper is to extend the understanding of the impact of this double level of discrimination at a vertical and horizontal level. The impact of stereotypes, gender roles and gendered organizations become the theoretical framework on this study. The biggest multinationals in the tourism industry were classified according to Eurostat’s definition of high-tech services in three intensive technological levels (High-Tech Knowledge Intensive; Knowledge-Intensive and Less Knowledge-lntensive). The composition of their Board of Directors (BOD) and Management Teams (MT) was analysed, through their annual reports and online public related documents, and evaluated through Content Analysis. Based on a total of 55 tourism related firms, the results confirm the direct relationship between the technological level of the companies and the lower participation of women on MT and BOD. Results also show that Gender Diversity Programs promote women representation on the BOD and that this relation is bi-directional, i.e. more women on BOD imply more gender diversity programs. © 2020, The Author(s).","Board of Directors; Corporate Governance; Decision making; Double gender gap; Technology; Tourism; Women",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078342991

Think tanks are especially active in setting frames for what constitutes politically and socially acceptable ways of thinking about economic activity and the rights or obligations of corporations. Their operation and influence has been acknowledged and analysed in political science and policy analysis, but in organization and management studies they are almost entirely ignored. In this paper, we review the existing literature on think tanks to develop an ethical–political framework based on a Gramsci’s account of state–civil society relations, referring to historical case materials relating to a significant Brazilian think tank, the Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Sociais (IPES). We show how the IPES was successful in bringing then-controversial neoliberal perspectives on management and organization into mainstream political debate, where they could be discussed and ultimately accepted as morally and intellectually legitimate. We note the importance of management education and business schools with respect to think tanks in the development of a hegemonic pro-capitalist interpretation of corporate responsibility, and suggest this is worth more investigation. We conclude by outlining how think tanks are central to civil society acceptance of pro-corporate ideologies, how they might be researched regarding the ethical implications of the work they do, and how our approach provides a foundation for this. © 2018, The Author(s).","Brazil; Business; Ethics; Gramsci; Hegemony; Ideology; Management; Politics; Think tanks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052938381

A game model is established to examine the dual-channel supply chain operations. Analytical results reveal that downstream productivity improvement (DPI) through the bilateral interaction is necessary and sufficient for the supply chain members to trade in the bilateral channel in addition to the futures market. We show that when the price in the futures market increases, the manufacturer would purchase less from the futures market and more from the supplier, which not only increases the supplier's expected profit but also increases her risk (variance of the profit) in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the bilateral channel exhibits stronger DPI, the manufacturer obtains a higher expected profit and bears a higher risk, but the supplier enjoys a higher expected profit without incurring any additional risk. © 2017 The Authors.

The objective of this study is to identify patient value dimensions in healthcare and to understand their relationships with patient satisfaction and loyalty. We conduct a case study in two hospitals in Shanghai, China. We identify economic value, health value, fair value, and supplemental value as four value dimensions. We use the combinational weighting method to evaluate the value-added ability of healthcare services, and use the structural equation model to examine the relationships between patient value, satisfaction, and loyalty. The value-added evaluation indicates significant room for improvement related to economic value for the large hospital, as well as to health value and fair value for the community hospital.

Much of this work has been conducted in personal computer (PC)-based settings, although mobile devices are becoming increasingly central to the online shopping experience. It remains to be examined if the effects of recommendation systems in retail differ across these two channels, in terms of customer-level decision outcomes. In this paper, we examine these differences in some detail, studying how product views and sales attributed to a recommendation system are different across mobile and PC-based channels. Further, we examine how the effect of a recommendation system across channels influences sales diversity, an important outcome in the retail industry. We conduct our analysis using a randomized field experiment, conducted in partnership with an online retailing firm in South Korea, where the experimental treatment is access to a recommendation system. Our results show that the use of recommendation systems enhances customer-level outcomes, such as views and sales of recommended products, clickthrough rate, and conversion. More importantly, the marginal impacts of the recommendation system are significantly higher for mobile users, indicating that the higher search costs imposed through mobile devices are more effectively reduced through recommendation systems. With respect to sales diversity, we observe that although the mobile channel leads to more diverse sales, we see no interaction effects of the recommendation system and mobile use on sales diversity. These results provide boundary conditions for the efficacy of recommendation systems in retail contexts where online sales occur across both PC-based and mobile channels. We discuss the managerial implications of these results for online retailers and conclude with opportunities for further research. © 2020 INFORMS.","Conversion funnel; Field experiment; Mobile channel; Mobile commerce; Recommendation systems; Sales diversity","Electronic commerce; Mobile telecommunication systems; Online systems; Personal computers; Sales; Click-through rate; Decision outcome; Field experiment; Interaction effect; Managerial implications; Mobile channels; Online retailing; Online shopping; Recommender systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092915141

The analyses are based on women’s management, which is more strongly associated with labor productivity than women’s participation in ownership, which has been the focus of most previous studies. Decomposition techniques reveal several factors that contribute to lower labor productivity of women-managed firms relative to firms managed by men: Fewer women-managed firms protect themselves from crime and power outages, have their own websites, and are (co-)owned by foreigners. In addition, in the manufacturing sector, women-managed firms are less capitalized and have lower labor costs than firms managed by men. © 2020 IAFFE.","decomposition; Firms; manufacturing industry; productivity; services; women entrepreneurs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091142585

Nevertheless, there remains a noticeable dearth of studies that address the potential impact of the players within the construction industry on various economic indicators. The goal of this research is to study how the economic performance of the US-measured in GDP-is impacted by the performance of the construction industry and its key players and how the performance of the construction industry could help in forecasting future US GDP. This goal is achieved by studying the relationship between GDP, total construction spending (TTLCONS), the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P500) index (GSPC), and the stocks of major publicly traded construction companies. The authors applied an interdependent research methodology that included (1) data collection, (2) statistical testing on the data using correlation analysis and Granger causality testing, and (3) vector autoregression (VAR) for both fitting and prediction purposes. A positive correlation was found between GDP, the S&P500, TTLCONS, and the stocks of major publicly traded construction-related companies. Also, the Granger causality test showed that some major construction company stocks are useful in forecasting GDP. The developed VAR model was used to forecast GDP for 2 years with acceptable accuracy. In this connection, the model was validated by successfully forecasting in a retrospective manner the effect of the 2008 financial crisis. This shows that the stock prices of select publicly traded construction and equipment companies can be used to predict GDP. In fact, a similar model could have been used to predict the 2008 economic collapse and develop ex ante mitigation strategies. The findings of this study could open opportunities for abandoning the notion of studying the construction industry solely using the health of residential construction. As such, this research should help in moving toward the development of a construction-economy nexus. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Commerce; Construction; Construction industry; Costs; Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Value engineering; Construction companies; Granger causality test; Gross domestic products; Relationship between stocks; Research methodologies; Residential construction; Us construction companies; Vector autoregressions; Construction equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074361587

One major decision faced by the owners of online marketplaces is whether they should enter into the market and sell products directly to customers. Although a few game-theoretical models have addressed this issue, there is still no empirical research to guide the decisions of managers. To fill this gap, this paper empirically investigates the impact of a platform owner’s entry on the demand of third-party stores, as well as their potential reactions, using data from a Chinese e-commerce platform that supports both online and offline transactions. We establish several important findings. First, we find that the offline demand of competing third-party stores decreases with the entry of the platform, whereas their online demand does not change significantly. Second, we systematically investigate three potential mechanisms underlying the effects of platform entry in the online and offline channels: the competition effect, the spillover effect, and the disintermediation effect. We show that the decreased offline demand results from third-party stores’ defensive strategy to divert their offline customers away from the platform (i.e., disintermediation) rather than from the defection of customers under competition. Third, in contrast to the prior finding from mobile app platforms, we find that the demand of larger third-party stores decreases more with the entry of the platform, suggesting that the effect of platform entry is context dependent. Our study suggests that, while making entry decisions, platform owners should consider the nature of their marketplaces (i.e., whether the competition among sellers is exclusive) and the potential reactions from third-party sellers.

The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives' trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their ""network trust"") impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives' professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives' trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives' knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes. © 2020 INFORMS.","Behavior; Behavioral operations; Belief; Executives; Experimental economics; Multimethod; Network trust; Organizational behavior; Professional experiences; Social network; Trust; Trustworthiness","Decision making; Knowledge management; Behavioral factors; Business interactions; Chain interactions; Forecast information; Professional experiences; Research designs; Trust and trustworthiness; Trusting behaviors; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097271182

The current practice of TODs has largely focused on individual transit station sites or TOD nodes, not fully capturing the corridor advantages associated with transit systems. This study develops a conceptual framework and an implementation tool for planning corridor TOD (C-TOD). C-TOD expands the conventional nodal TOD concept and practice to 1) capture corridor level interactions between individual TOD nodes, and 2) incorporate economic, social, and environmental indicators with the physical planner/design attributes for modeling and evaluating C-TOD plans. Conceptually, the study defines C-TOD spatially as individuals' travel shed within a travel time budget of 55–65 min along the transit service segment of 15–20 miles (stations). Operationally, the C-TOD tool measures TOD site attributes with 5D variables (Density, Diversity, Design, Distance to Transit, and Destination Accessibility) and quantifies three sustainability indicators in the C-TOD context with transit premiums, total accessibility to services and housing opportunities, and building and household travel emissions. To implement the multi-objective C-TOD tool, the study applies genetic algorithms to search, assess, and identify optimal C-TOD alternatives under user-specified planning and policy targets and constraints. A case study of Metro Line #2 in Wuhan, China, is presented to illustrate the C-TOD framework and optimization tool. As mass rapid transit systems continue to expand around the world, the C-TOD concept and tool introduced in this study can help practitioners and policy makers to augment TOD applications with improved land use planning and decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corridor-transit-oriented development; Genetic algorithms; Land use plans; Sustainability; Wuhan China","conceptual framework; decision making; genetic algorithm; land use planning; metro system; policy making; sustainability; travel time; urban planning; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091753892

The available resources can be shared by many firms which are grouped by industry, just as universities collaborate with many firms in many industries. This paper studies a region in Mexico and the firms within that region with the aim being to identify which of those firms are using the available resources in the best way. We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a methodology for evaluating the relative efficiencies of the firms, based on their multiple inputs and outputs, and considering their processes as being divided into two stages. An important problem in this setting is that the two-stage process exhibits the characteristic of having outputs being shared among the firms in each industry; this makes it more challenging to determine independent efficiency scores for each firm in each industry, where we need to cater for this phenomenon. To address this, the current article presents a methodology for measuring efficiency in situations where Decision Making Units (DMUs) share outputs with other units within the same group. By solving this problem, we can identify the best-performers and their strategies regarding how they use the available resources in the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Common outputs; Data envelopment analysis; Regional innovation systems; Two-stage problem","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Regional planning; Comparative performance; Decision making unit; Me-xico; Multiple inputs and outputs; Regional innovation systems; Relative efficiency; Two-stage process; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086728312

This study also aims to answer the call to further negative signalling and explore immediate reactions to signals, thus alleviating a gap with regard to temporality of signalling. Design/methodology/approach: The study used two separate data sources, the S&P 500 and 51,500 pages of the public papers between 1981 and 1999, nearly 20 years of data. Inter-rater reliability, controlled for all macroeconomic announcements identified in the literature, is used, and the data are empirically tested using generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GJR-GARCH) modelling. Findings: In accordance with signalling theory and the efficient market hypothesis, the study found that receivers do react to positive signals from a credible insider signaller to obviate information asymmetry. In line with previous research, the study also finds that receivers react much stronger to negative signals. Practical implications: Investors, financial managers and top executives responsible for their stock price need to focus on presidential signalling as these directly affect market volatility. In particular, investors and financial managers can predict stock price volatility based upon signals from the president. Originality/value: This is the first research study that explores the correlation between presidential signalling and market volatility.

The availability of big data, advances in data analytics tools, and rapid gains in processing power enable firms to make decisions based on data rather than intuition. Yet, most firms still allow managers to override decisions from DDD tools, as managers might possess private information not present in the DDD tool. We report on a field-experiment conducted by an automobile replacement parts retailer that examines the profit implications of providing discretionary power to merchants. We find that merchants’ overrides of the DDD tool reduce profitability by 5.77%.

This paper seeks to answer two main questions - whether these programs are broadly effective in inducing conservation, and what are the most effective versions of these programs. Using a meta-analysis of 116 studies, we examine the effects of information-based interventions on residential customers' consumption of electricity, gas, and water. We find evidence of publication bias in this literature. After correcting for publication bias, meta-analysis results indicate that information-based interventions reduce consumption by an average of 6.24%, 95% CI [-10.72, -1.76]. In addition, we find that studies employing RCTs find smaller conservation effects, (-5.2%, 95% CI [−9.53, −0.51]). Our results show that the effectiveness of information-based interventions at the household level are significantly larger than those at the aggregate level (such as dorms and buildings). Finally, interventions with a shorter duration or with more frequent reporting show larger estimated effect sizes. © 2020","Conservation; Information; Meta-analysis; Nudges; Publication bias; Random forest; Social norms","Economics; Natural resources management; Conservation effects; Effect size; Energy and water conservations; Household level; Meta analysis; Publication bias; Residential customers; Water conservation; conservation management; consumption behavior; energy conservation; household structure; information system; literature review; meta-analysis; resource allocation; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091553997

We find that newly-binding limits on permanent visas for those from China and India with advanced degrees are significantly associated with declines in stay rates. The stay rate of Chinese graduates declines by 2.1 percentage points for each year of delay, while Indian graduates facing delays of at least 5½ years have a stay rate that is 10.6 percentage points lower. The per-country permanent visa cap affects a large share of STEM PhDs who are disproportionately found in fields of study that have been crucial in stimulating US economic growth yet enroll relatively few natives. Finally, results suggest that the growth of science in countries of origin has an important influence on stay rates, while macroeconomic factors such as GDP per capita affect stay rates only via their impact on science funding. We conclude that per-country limits play a significant role in constraining the supply of highly skilled STEM workers in the US economy. © 2019",,"Engineering; China and India; Growth of science; In-field; Per capita; Percentage points; STEM program; US economic growth; US economy; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077158443

However, the new business model associated with SaaS highlights the importance for SaaS vendors to understand how to retain customers in a hyper-competitive market. In particular, increasing customer retention and preventing customers from replacing the adopted SaaS applications has become a crucial task for all SaaS vendors. In this study, using a mixed-methods approach, and drawing on the cognitive-affective-conative-action (CACA) framework, we investigate the IS replacement phenomenon in the context of SaaS-delivered applications. Our qualitative study allows us to develop an IS-centric view of customer commitment by differentiating between organizations' commitment to the SaaS application and to the cloud computing technology in general, while the subsequent quantitative study validates the difference between the two types of commitment and helps understand how they together influence organizations' intentions to replace a SaaS application. Our results generate important theoretical implications for research on IS replacement and clarifies the concept of customer commitment. We also offer practical guidelines to SaaS vendors on how to retain customers so as to survive/thrive in this competitive market. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

People pay less for uncertain prospects than their worst possible outcomes, and researchers have proposed that this effect occurs because people strongly dislike risk. We challenge this proposition across seven studies. Though people seem to irrationally dislike risky prospects when preference is assessed with open-ended pricing measures, such as willingness-to-pay, people display rational responses toward risky prospects when preference is assessed using rating measures, such as ratings of expected enjoyment. This discrepancy does not seemto arise because these measures (a) focus on different components of the uncertainty, (b) rely on contextdependent versus normed scales, or (c) involve voluntarily opting into an uncertain situation. Accordingly, we find that people also display rational responses toward risky prospects with time measures (i.e., willingness-to-wait and anticipated time usage) and choice. We discuss alternative explanations and crucial implications of our effects for both theory and application.

Results confirmed a eudaemonic well-being value structure of seven factors: engagement and interaction with nature, place identity, therapeutic value, spiritual value, social bonds, memory/transformative value, and challenge and skill. Visibility of, but not proximity to aquaculture negatively influenced housing prices. In contrast, proximity to MPAs and visibility of scenic areas increased property values. All eudaemonic well-being value factors were positively and significantly associated with scenic areas and a subset of these with MPAs. The integration of the two methods can provide decision-makers with a more comprehensive picture of CES values, their relation to conservation policies and interactions and trade-offs with other activities and services. © 2020 The Authors","Aquaculture; Cultural ecosystem services; Eudaemonic well-being; Hedonic pricing; Integrated valuation; Marine ecosystem services; Relational values","aquaculture production; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental policy; hedonic analysis; price determination; protected area; trade-environment relations; valuation; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086829045

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the participation of 140 managers across ten industry sectors, a theoretical model is proposed and structural equation modeling is used to examine the relationships among SC risk management integration, SC counterfeit risk orientation (CRO), SC counterfeit risk mitigation (CRM), SC metric consistency (MC) and SC performance (service and cost benefits). Findings: Findings suggest that firms with greater SC risk management integration have a stronger orientation toward counterfeit risk, greater maturity in CRM, more consistent SC metrics and better SC performance outcomes. CRO alone was not found to significantly improve SC MC. Research limitations/implications: Results are based on managerial perceptions of SC counterfeit risk and performance metrics.

But the traditional HBRB model is one-step forecasting model, which means that it can only utilize the limited information in very short time instant. In fact, one-step forecasting method is incomplete because the future behavior of a complex system is generated through multiple historical stats in different time instant. Therefore, a time-delay hidden BRB forecasting model (THBRB) is designed, where the input with multiple time instant of the HBRB model is considered, and the corresponding reasoning process is also designed. Further, an optimization method based on projection covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (P-CMA-ES) algorithm is used to train the initial THBRB model. A case study is established to prove the advantage of the proposed method, and the experiment results show that the proposed THBRB model can predict the future hidden behavior of complex system effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","BRB model; Hidden behavior; Time series prediction; Time-delay","Covariance matrix; Time delay; Timing circuits; Behavior prediction; Belief rule base; Evolution strategies; Forecasting methods; Forecasting modeling; Limited information; Optimization method; Reasoning process; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086821464

From a county-level DBI panel data constructed based on firm- and county-level datasets, we find that clusters enhance local economic growth substantially. Moreover, the existence of entrepreneurial clusters (clusters mainly consist of nonstate-owned firms) helps to reduce local urban-rural income inequality by increasing the income of local rural residents. We also find that the clustering effects on growth and reduction of inequality are less significant in more urbanized regions or megacities.

The aim of this paper is to improve the accuracy of project time forecasting by extending exponential smoothing for project time forecasting using EVM and EDM with the integration of corrective actions that are taken during project progress. In order to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of this approach, eight projects conducted in recent years have been followed up in real time. Based on the nature of the observed corrective actions, six distinct categories of corrective actions are identified. The empirical experiment showed that explicitly integrating the occurrence of corrective actions into the forecasting process improves the forecasting accuracy of traditional forecasting methods and forecasting methods using standard exponential smoothing, especially for the middle and late phases of projects. Consequently, by including corrective actions in the forecasting process, project managers can predict the final project duration more accurately. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Corrective actions; Empirical data; Exponential smoothing; Project forecasting","Budget control; Value engineering; Corrective actions; Earned value management; Empirical experiments; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting methods; Project duration; Project performance; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085702142

A relevant difference between developed and emerging economies is the reduced access to home charging in emerging economies, which is the case in Latin American cities. Thus, developing public charging stations represents a crucial factor in the mass adoption of EVs by road commuters. We develop herein a methodology for optimizing the deployment of smart charging stations under the sprawling phenomenon perspective. Our method comprises two steps. In step one, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to facilitate the analysis of a sprawling city, and then we define candidates for potential locations from ‘demand clusters’ within an urbanized area, by K-means clustering analysis. In the second step, a stochastic programming model was employed to optimize the integration of infrastructural facilities with distributed energy resources (DERs) and EV charging stations using a collaborative strategy to minimize its energy consumption cost under demand uncertainty. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach through a case study in the city of Lima. Experimental results reveal managerial insights for different stakeholders (i.e., government, industry, academia, and civil society) to promote policies, investment, and incentives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Charging stations; Clustering; Electric vehicle; Smart cities; Sprawling; Stochastic optimization","Charging (batteries); Economics; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Investments; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Collaborative strategies; Distributed Energy Resources; Emerging economies; Ev charging stations; Infrastructural facilities; K-means clustering analysis; Public infrastructures; Stochastic programming model; Principal component analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084676372

Social network theory suggests that buyer–supplier relationships are influenced by networks of ties in which they are embedded. While prior research has concentrated on networks of trade interactions, we instead examine the influences of networks through common investors. Utilizing a large sample of buyer–supplier relationships, we find that the presence of CIIs improves suppliers' operating and market performance, especially for suppliers with greater dependence on buyers. In addition, supplier performance increases with the common ownership stakes held by CIIs, but decreases with the asymmetric ownership stakes of CIIs across supply chain partners. We find that better financial collaboration between the partners appears to be a mechanism through which CIIs enhance supplier performance. Lastly, we find that the role of CIIs in strengthening supplier performance is distinct from that of direct equity links. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel role of indirect cross-ownership in fostering supply chain collaboration and coordinating vertical relationships and, in turn, improving supplier performance. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","asymmetric ownership stake; buyer–supplier relationships; common institutional investors (CIIs); common ownership stake; supplier performance","Commerce; Investments; Sales; Cross ownership; Institutional investors; Market performance; Supplier performance; Supplier relationships; Supply chain collaboration; Supply chain partners; Vertical relationships; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083703198

Owing to the growing complexity of organizations and economy in general, this trend is expected to continue to remain a high priority for organizations. Continuous performance evaluations that utilize both qualitative and quantitative information play a significant role in sustaining efficient and effective business processes. Therefore, the literature offers a wide range of performance evaluation methodologies to assess the operational efficiency in various industries. Majority of these models, however, focus solely on quantitative criteria, avoiding the interrelations and dependencies between qualitative and quantitative measurements. Furthermore, these methodologies tend to utilize discrete and contemporary information eliminating historical performance data. With these motivations, this paper proposes an integrated approach combining fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and artificial neural network (ANN) methodologies for performance evaluation. In the proposed model, DEMATEL and ANP methodologies are utilized in a group decision-making concept to obtain priorities of the evaluation criteria. Following this, an ANN model is designed and trained with historical performance data collected from the organization and the results of the fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP model.

It has been approached by many researchers, across a range of disciplines, and has a rich and distinguished history. Much of this interest reflects the general utility of single facility siting, but also the mathematical and computational advancements that have been made over past decades to support better decision making. This paper discusses a recently rediscovered form of Weber's classic single facility location problem that is both important and relevant in contemporary planning and decision making. This form of the Weber problem involves locating a production plant where there are multiple sources of each needed raw material (input) distributed throughout a region. This means that the selection of a given raw material source may vary depending on the plant location. In essence, this makes the problem non-convex, even when locating only one production plant. We review elements of the Weber problem that have been addressed in the literature along with proposed solution techniques. In doing so, we highlight elements of the problem originally noted by Weber, but to date have not been operationalized in practice––allocation selection among multiple sources of given raw material inputs. A problem formulation involving allocation decisions for this generalization is derived and an optimal solution approach is developed. Application results demonstrate the significance of addressing important planning characteristics and the associated nuances that result. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GIS; Location; Spatial optimization; Voronoi diagram; Weber","Decision making; Geographic information systems; Allocation decision; Problem formulation; Raw material sources; Single facility location problem; Solution techniques; Spatial optimization; Voronoi diagrams; Weber; Location",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079523545

This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers’ opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers’ preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers’ opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product.

Although such laws have been in existence since 1997, there were gaps in it especially when it came to how sludge generated from effluent treatment will be managed. This gap was addressed in 2015 through publication of national standards and guidelines for sludge management detailing some management options. These options have not yet reached the level necessary to address the scale of the problem, about which relevant data & information from all industries are unavailable. This study attempts to address the data gap by mapping the sources of sludge generation and available management options using geographic information system. Although these maps are not comprehensive in coverage of all sources and options, it offers basic assessment for developing a supply chain to route sludge from treatment plants to existing options offering productive uses. Several studies have investigated productive uses of sludge in the context of Bangladesh, but a macro perspective of developing an industrial symbiosis remain unexplored. This paper recommends use of sludge as partial substitute of clay for brick making in the short run mainly because of existing spatial distribution of kilns near generating sources. In the long run, investments are needed to develop infrastructure and supply chain to avail other management options including transportation for dealing with this resource. The need for additional studies is highlighted to understand capacities and costs involved in developing this system while also considering resource conservation and environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brick-kilns; Co-processing; Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP); Incineration; Sludge","Brick; Brickmaking; Conservation; Effluents; Environmental regulations; Incineration; Information management; Information use; Investments; Kilns; Mapping; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Brick kilns; Coprocessing; Effluent treatment plants; Environmental sustainability; Industrial symbiosis; Management options; Resource conservation; Sludge; Effluent treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081682923

The access elements include the right to development and basic needs satisfaction and the allocation issues include distribution of resources, risks and burdens and the assignment of responsibilities. The development pathways for many developing countries will be constrained by national level GHG emission reduction commitments as well as sub-national efforts. Yet, the current level of commitments is not sufficient to keep global temperature increase below 1.5 °C. Hence, an important question is what does a decadal review of the relevant literature tell us about how to conceptualize and define access and allocation in the area of climate change mitigation governance? The paper concludes that access and allocation issues of climate change mitigation are inextricably interlinked; calling for holistic&#8232;strategies for mitigating environmental impacts while addressing social problems. The access issues can be governed through market mechanisms, in combination with an equity and justice approach for the poorest communities, and technology and social innovation, while allocation issues are governed by public policies, institutions, bottom–up decision making, mainstreaming of climate policies and international cooperation. The main characteristics of developing countries have not been adequately incorporated in present-day mitigation models. Further multidisciplinary research is needed to foster efficient and equitable climate, energy and forest governance which should be consistent with sustainable, inclusive and low carbon development pathways. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Access; Allocation; Climate change; Developing countries; Governance; Justice; Mitigation","access restriction; basic needs; climate change; decision making; developing world; environmental impact; environmental policy; equity; greenhouse gas; innovation; policy implementation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085472149

We show that Nokia diligently analyzed the competitive dynamics of other industries, such as the personal computer industry, that had already been affected by the same technological discontinuities and used the lessons from these industries to anticipate future competition outcomes in the mobile phone business. We also show that analogical reasoning helped Nokia's managers change the beliefs developed through their prior experiences. However, Nokia's managers became overconfident in their new beliefs, and this overconfidence constrained their cognitive processes of attention and interpretation, thereby increasing organizational inertia.

Using parametric and semi-parametric estimation methods, we examine how managerial ownership influences firm value in light of the trade-off between the alignment and the risk-substitution effects. We find that risk-substitution offsets the alignment effect of managerial ownership in firms that are exposed to severe risk-substitution problems, leading to a weak (or non-existent) association between managerial ownership and firm value. We identify a plausible channel for these effects by showing that firms exposed to risk-substitution exhibit more “conservative” investment and financing policies. We also show that the risk-substitution problem is partially mitigated by the inclusion of stock options in managerial compensation packages. Finally, our findings suggest that semi-parametric methods may prove useful for future studies aiming at capturing nonlinear features in the data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Finance; Idiosyncratic risk; Managerial ownership; Risk-substitution; Semi-parametric estimation","Alignment; Economic and social effects; Finance; Investments; Managers; Parameter estimation; Profitability; Risk management; Compensation packages; Investment and financings; Managerial ownership; Nonlinear features; Personal portfolio; Semi parametric estimation; Substitution effect; Substitution problem; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077167561

The construction industry in Oman is one of the first among countries in the Arab states to pursue sustainable development. However, understanding the implementation challenges associated with CE is important to this region, as it attempts to diversify its economies beyond oil and gas, which is vital to the success of the country. The main challenges identified within the literature in relation to CE include a lack of knowledge of the concept, unclear financial implications, misaligned regulations and a lack of transparent technical data. The aim of this study was to explore such challenges within the context of Oman, and an exploratory study consisting of ten interviews and 80 survey responses was undertaken. Factor analysis results revealed that the critical challenges of CE ultimately begin with government barriers such as the absence of a clear vision and legislation supporting CE. This was followed by a lack of government funding for research, innovation and investment, as well as technical barriers such as a lack of qualified professionals in the field. © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",,"Construction industry; Economics; Laws and legislation; Built environment; Critical challenges; Exploratory studies; Financial implications; Government funding; Resource depletion; Technical barriers; Waste generation; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089063625

To achieve satisfactory outcomes with BIM, adopters need to find the most appropriate implementation strategy that is economically efficient. The research discussed here explores why and how distribution of effort spent on various tasks over project life cycle can be used as a metric for assessing and improving the performance of BIM implementation. Using quantitative data collected from a single in-depth case study of a BIM-enabled design and build project and subsequent interviews with three project actors and 11 BIM experts, to validate and triangulate the findings, we explore the use of effort data to analyze and visualize effort distribution patterns. The visualizations revealed the dynamics of team collaboration and task interdependences in BIM-enabled work and their impact on effort distribution. Lack of timely input by the contractor, subcontractors and suppliers influenced unusual patterns in the distribution of efforts indicating potential sources of inefficiency and unnecessary costs in the BIM process; thereby revealing the pivotal role of procurement structure and suggesting the need for timely involvement of key project participants. The contribution of this work is twofold. Methodologically, effort distribution analytics can provide insights that managers can use to improve BIM implementation process.

Although the online availability of drugs has been a growing concern with considerable speculation that digital platforms are contributing to this epidemic, empirical assessments have been lacking. To quantify this impact, we rely on the phased rollout of Craigslist, a major online platform, as an experimental setup. Applying a difference-in-differences approach on a national panel data set for all counties in the United States from 1997 to 2008, we find a 14.9% increase in drug abuse treatment admissions, a 5.7% increase in drug abuse violations, and a 6.0% increase in drug overdose deaths after Craigslist's entry. The impacts of Craigslist's entry are larger among women, whites, Asians, and the more educated. Further, the unintended consequences of Craigslist are more likely to accrue in larger, wealthier areas with initially low levels of drug abuse. These findings raise the possibility that the marked growth in U.S. drug abuse may have partially stemmed from the wider availability of illicit drugs online at the very beginning of its evolution.

However, the current policy of voluntary profiling allows firms to collect and use customer information only if customers voluntarily disclose information with them. Further, surveys and literature show that many customers are not comfortable with firms collecting their information due to privacy concerns. A vast literature has examined customer information disclosing behavior using the privacy calculus. The primary premise of the privacy calculus is that despite strong privacy concerns, customers disclose information if the benefits they can get from disclosure justify the costs of losing privacy, or privacy costs. Based on the privacy calculus, firms and marketers believe that customers voluntarily disclose information in exchange for monetary benefits such as discount coupons or cash rewards. Using transaction data that we collected from a firm that sells skin care cosmetic products on its website, we investigate if there is statistical evidence that shows customers disclose information in exchange for monetary benefits. In line with the privacy calculus, we find that customers with low privacy costs and that expect high benefits from personalized services such as product recommendations are more likely to disclose information. Monetary incentives only work as an effective means to elicit information from customers in the age range of 12–21 years old. Customers, on average, and especially customers in the age range of 22–54 years old are not likely to disclose information simply as a tradeoff for monetary benefits. Personalized services outweigh monetary benefits in enticing these customers to disclose information. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coupon redemption; Customer data analytics; Information disclosing; Privacy calculus; Rx. cosmetics; Voluntary profiling","Calculations; Data Analytics; Sales; Skin care products; Coupon redemption; Customer information; Empirical examination; Information disclosing; Personalized service; Product recommendation; Statistical evidence; Voluntary profiling; Information use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082536772

In common with the reaction to sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes in other countries, the SDIL announcement was met with strong industry opposition, with claims that it would harm their profits. The SDIL was designed to incentivise reformulation of SSBs by providing a 2-year delay between the announcement and the enforcement of the levy, and adopting a two-tiered rate based on the sugar content of the drinks. Using interrupted time series analysis, this paper examines how the domestic turnover of UK soft drinks manufacturers changed after the announcement and the implementation of the SDIL. Our results show some evidence of a short-term negative impact of the SDIL announcement on the domestic turnover of the UK soft drinks manufacturers. This effect, however, did not continue post-implementation.

We experimentally investigate continue/abandon decisions in a multistage project under two conditions: when the project is reviewed at every stage and when review opportunities are limited. Our results confirm findings in the literature that project abandonment tends to be delayed; yet, we also observe premature termination. Decisions are highly path dependent; in particular, subjects are more likely to abandon after observing reduced project value, and abandonment rate is higher near the middle-rather than near the beginning or end-of a project. Interestingly, when reviews are limited, subjects are less likely to continue a project that should be abandoned. At the same time, subjects are more inclined to review again after receiving negative (rather than positive) news. Our data are explained well by a model that incorporates three behavioral concepts-gains or losses from comparing the project value with an internal adaptive reference point, sunk cost bias, and status quo bias. Our work suggests that more frequent reviews need not lead to better project performance, and it also identifies contexts in which outside intervention is most valuable in project decision making.

Further, we establish an identification strategy using the 2014 geopolitical conflict between Ukraine and Russia as an exogenous shock to banks' branch networks.

However, little is known about patterns of utilisation and costs across sectors for people with SMI. Objective: The aim was to develop a costing methodology and estimate annual healthcare costs for people with SMI in England across primary and secondary care settings. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using linked administrative records from primary care, emergency departments, inpatient admissions, and community mental health services, covering financial years 2011/12–2013/14. Costs were calculated using bottom-up costing and are expressed in 2013/14 British pounds (GBP). Determinants of annual costs by sector were estimated using generalised linear models. Results: Mean annual total healthcare costs for 13,846 adults with SMI were £4989 (median £1208), comprising 19% from primary care (£938, median £531), 34% from general hospital care (£1717, median £0), and 47% from inpatient and community-based specialist mental health services (£2334, median £0). Mean annual costs related specifically to mental health, as distinct from physical health, were £2576 (median £290). Key predictors of total cost included physical comorbidities, ethnicity, neighbourhood deprivation, SMI diagnostic subgroup, and age. Some associations varied across care context; for example, older age was associated with higher primary care and hospital costs, but lower mental healthcare costs. Conclusions: Annual healthcare costs for people with SMI vary significantly across clinical and socioeconomic characteristics and healthcare sectors. This analysis informs policy and research, including estimation of health budgets for particular patient profiles, and economic evaluation of health services and policies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adult; affective psychosis; aged; Article; bipolar disorder; cohort analysis; community mental health service; comorbidity; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; disease association; emergency ward; England; ethnic group; female; financial management; general hospital; health care cost; hospital admission; hospital care; hospital cost; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; mental disease; mental health care; middle aged; neighborhood; observational study; primary medical care; retrospective study; schizophrenia; secondary health care; social status; young adult; economics; hospitalization; mental disease; mental health service; pathophysiology; primary health care; severity of illness index; specialization; England; Health Care Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Specialization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074865046

However, problems with the measurement of productivity change usually occur when analyzing companies that merged during the period under consideration: while only individual predecessor firms exist in the base period, in the following period only the integrated company is observable. We therefore propose a new adaptation of the Malmquist index that is appropriate in the presence of mergers, which also allows for a detailed analysis of their effects on productivity change. Moreover, we believe that our methodological approach provides a useful widely applicable tool to identify the contribution of past mergers to productivity growth. We illustrate our merger consistent productivity decomposition, by using a sample of Japanese water supply systems observed in 2003, and the resulting consolidated and non-consolidated systems observed in 2009. On average, we find that mergers contributed positively to productivity change and that our merger consistent decomposition contributes to a better understanding of the determinants of productivity performance in the Japanese water sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Japanese water supply; Malmquist index; Mergers and consolidation; Productivity and competitiveness","Decomposition; Merging; Productivity; Water supply; Water supply systems; Malmquist indices; Methodological approach; Policy makers; Productivity and competitiveness; Productivity changes; Productivity growth; Productivity performance; Water sector; Mergers and acquisitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072565394

The growth literature is awash with divergent evidence on the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth. Although the FDI–growth nexus has been studied in diverse ways, very few studies have examined the relationship within the framework of threshold analysis. Furthermore, even where this framework has been adopted, none of the previous studies has comprehensively examined the FDI–growth nexus in the broader SSA. In this paper, within the standard panel and threshold regression framework, the problem of determining the growth impact of FDI is revisited. Design/methodology/approach: Six variables are used as thresholds – inflation, initial income, population growth, trade openness, financial market development and human capital, and the analysis is based on a large panel data set that comprises 45 SSA countries for the years 1985–2013. Findings: The results of this study show that the direct impact of FDI on growth is largely ambiguous and inconsistent. However, under the threshold analysis, it is evident that FDI accelerates economic growth when SSA countries have achieved certain threshold levels of inflation, population growth and financial markets development. This evidence is largely invariant qualitatively and is robust to different empirical specifications. FDI enhances growth in SSA when inflation and private sector credit are below their threshold levels while human capital and population growth are above their threshold levels. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper streamlines the threshold analysis of FDI–growth nexus to focus on countries in SSA – previous studies on FDI-growth nexus in SSA are country-specific and time series–based (see Tshepo, 2014; Raheem and Oyınlola, 2013 and Bende-Nabende, 2002). This paper provides a panel analysis and considers a broader set of up to 45 SSA countries. Such a broad set of SSA countries had never been considered in the literature. Second, the paper expands on available threshold variables to include two new important macroeconomic variables, population growth and inflation which, though are important absorptive capacities but, until now, had not been used as thresholds in the FDI–growth literature. The rationale for including these variables as thresholds stems from the evidence of an empirical relationship between population growth and economic growth, see Darrat and Al-Yousif (1999), and between inflation and economic growth, see Kremer et al. (2013). © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Threshold analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079741095

We consider a setting in which a monopolist sells an indivisible good to consumers who are embedded in a social network. Academic/practical relevance: This is an important problem as sellers can use available data to design and send targeted promotions that account for social externality effects and ultimately increase their profits. Methodology: We capture the interactions among consumers using a broad class of nonlinear utility models. This class extends the existing models by explicitly capturing externalities from subsets of agents (communities or groups) and includes several existing models as special cases (e.g., full information version of the triggering model). Assuming complete information about the interactions, we model the optimal pricing problem as a two-stage game. First, the firm designs prices to maximize profits and then consumers choose whether to purchase the item. Results: Under positive network externalities, we show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium that is preferred by both the seller and the buyers. Using duality theory and integer-programming techniques, we reformulate the problem into a linear mixed-integer program (MIP). We derive efficient ways to optimally solve the MIP using its linear-programming relaxation for two pricing strategies: discriminative and uniform. Finally, we propose two intuitive heuristic algorithms to solve the problem for which we derive worst-case parametric performance bounds. Managerial implications: We draw interesting insights on the structure of the optimal prices and the seller’s profit. In particular, we quantify the effect on prices when using a nonlinear utility model relative to a linear model and identify settings with which it is beneficial to offer a price below cost to influential agents. Finally, we extend our model and results to the case in which the seller offers incentives (in addition to prices) to solicit actions so as to ensure network externality effects. © 2019 INFORMS.","Influence models; Integer programming; Network externalities; Pricing; Social networks","Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Linear programming; Profitability; Sales; Structural optimization; Complete information; Linear programming relaxation; Managerial implications; Mixed-integer programs; Network externality; Parametric performance; Pure Nash equilibrium; Social interactions; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085120409

The decision modelled is the mode and port choice at a planning level, where multiple alternatives can be chosen simultaneously. The relevant variables were the Free Alongside Ship (FAS) price, freight transport cost, travel time and lead time, including non-observed heterogeneity in the modelling. As a consequence, the willingness to pay measures that are used for the cost benefit analysis become non-deterministic. To include this effect simulated WTP measurements were included and compared to a deterministic and risk based approach. Two projects were tested and both showed that the deterministic approach gives higher Benefit/Cost ratio. This paper raises the concern that if non-observed heterogeneity is not considered in project evaluation it may provide misleading results and potentially lead to wrong investment priorities for the public sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost benefit analysis; Freight choice modelling; MDCEV, Multiple discreteness","Costs; Economics; Freight transportation; Investments; Project management; Traffic control; Travel time; Benefit/cost ratios; Choice modelling; Deterministic approach; Infrastructure planning; MDCEV, Multiple discreteness; Rail infrastructure; Revealed preference datum; Risk based approaches; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; discrete choice analysis; freight transport; infrastructure planning; investment; numerical model; railway; social impact; Argentina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079006044

Questions remain if cash transfers can foster investments in productive assets in addition to raising immediate consumption among the very poor, particularly in rural Africa. Further, can asset investment gains be sustained over the medium-term after transfer programme termination? We use quasi-experimental methods combining difference-in-differences with matching on baseline observables to estimate the impacts of a bundled transfer programme on asset levels of beneficiary households 18 months after project completion. The results suggest that small regular cash transfers combined with enhanced saving mechanisms can generate asset accumulation among the extreme poor. In this case, the bundled intervention induces sustained investments in livestock assets. These gains occur among the poorest households and are not driven by gains among less poor beneficiaries. A lasting increase in participation in tontines (rotating saving groups) is also found among beneficiary households, suggesting bundled saving enhancement activities may contribute to observed asset gains. © The Author(s) 2019.","cash transfers; investments; medium-term impacts; Niger; productive assets; quasi-experimental methods; savings","banking; capital flow; consumption behavior; household income; investment; savings; Niger [Nigeria]; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082311931

Our model focuses on a class of products with the following two features: (i) products that build on a common fundamental technology (e.g., computer processor, car, smartphone, etc.) and (ii) that consumers can observe some product attributes of a product (e.g., CPU clock speed, horsepower of a car engine, screen size of a smartphone, etc.), but when making their purchase decisions, consumers are not sure how efficiently the product can translate its observed attributes to performing tasks that they care about. For products that base on a similar technology, it is plausible that consumers use the information signals of one product's technological efficiency to help them update their belief about another product's technological efficiency within the same product category. As a result, a late entrant could benefit from the information spillover generated by an early entrant. We apply our framework to the statin market in Canada, where drugs rely on a similar mechanism to reduce the cholesterol level. In our model, patients/doctors can observe a statin's efficacy in reducing the cholesterol level, but they are uncertain about how effectively it can convert its cholesterol-reducing ability to reducing heart disease risks.

The theory of information uncertainty (IU) suggests that the anomaly is amplified with IU; that is, with ambiguity in information about firm value. We theorize that a firm's IT in general- and enterprise systems (ES) in particular-can mitigate IU, thus reducing the IU-induced underreaction anomaly. Based on a difference-in-differences analysis of a sample of 572 ES implementations, our main finding is that ES implementation does reduce IU-induced underreaction anomaly. This is achieved through a reduction in the firm's fundamentals volatility and an improvement in information quality. We also find that firms with greater IT capability are better positioned to realize the anomaly-reducing benefits of ES implementation and that ES's anomaly-reducing effect ismost pronouncedwhen high levels of both functional and operational ES modules are implemented. We obtain remarkably consistent results when using alternate empirical design, samples, and measures of news. Such IT impacts are economically highly consequential because they improve capital market efficiency. © 2019 INFORMS.","Anomaly; Capital market; Enterprise systems; Information uncertainty; IT business value; Market efficiency","Commerce; Efficiency; Financial markets; Investments; Anomaly; Enterprise system; Information uncertainty; IT business values; Market efficiency; Information use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080030503

The hope is that this paper will stimulate other researchers to replicate the methodology and in so doing open a new direction for innovation methodologies such as Value Engineering and Value Management that link capital projects to growth in GDP. © Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.","Capital projects; Economic growth; Government; Innovation; Productivity; Value management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079286117

The study specifically considers the role of planning instances and communication patterns among members of the surgery team on supply waste within the OR. We operationalize planning instances in terms of the number of changes to the physician preference card (PPC), the key document that is used to plan items needed for surgery. Communication patterns among members of the surgery team are captured by measuring the density of communication among the OR team members during an episode of care. The unplanned costs during an episode of care are used as a measure of OR supply waste. Hundreds of hours were spent observing episodes of care and tracking supplies. A combination of participant-observation, survey, and secondary data were analyzed to extract theoretical and practical insights. The results show that planning instances have a curvilinear relationship with unplanned costs. In particular, as the number of changes to the PPC increases, unplanned costs first increase and then decrease. Higher density of the OR team's communication network is associated with lower unplanned costs. This study has significant theoretical and managerial implications that we discuss and offer directions for future research. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","econometric analysis; ethnography; healthcare; operating room; physician preference card; planning; social network analysis; team communication; unplanned costs; waste","Health care; Operating rooms; Planning; Social networking (online); Surgery; Surveys; Wastes; Communication pattern; Econometric analysis; Ethnographic study; ethnography; Managerial implications; Participant observations; Physician preferences; Team communication; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075713278

A primary strategy for reducing the size and managing a large number of spare parts is using grouping techniques and data aggregation. In this paper, we address the question of how to reduce the size and complexity of large-scale, two-echelon, service part provisioning systems to benefit both inventory service levels and managerial processes while considering performance trade-offs. This paper contributes a performance-based inventory classification approach for a two-echelon inventory model by developing a novel ranking method. First, it defines the concept of the artificial stocking policy as a new classification criterion in the literature. Then, it adopts a non-subjective weighted linear scoring method for ranking items in the entire network. Finally, it presents a heuristic partitioning method, which is evaluated and compared with complete enumeration and eight alternative clustering and classification methods. The proposed model is implemented and tested in the context of the classic repairable spare part inventory model, called the VARI-METRIC. The results indicate that the proposed method is easy to apply and significantly outperforms the alternatives. © 2019","Artificial stocking policy (ASP); Classification performance penalty; Multi-echelon systems; Spare-part classification; Weighted linear scoring","Economic and social effects; Inventory control; Artificial stocking policy (ASP); Classification performance; Multi-echelon systems; Spare parts; Weighted linear scoring; Heuristic methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066600688

Using a unique dataset from a large fashion retailer which frequently sends mass non-customized information-only posts on social media (i.e., non-coupons), findings indicate that such posts increase short-term purchases by 6%. However, these posts also increase followers' propensity to unfollow the firm by 280%, significantly reducing long-term sales. Strikingly, this punitive effect of social media posting appears to manifest under very specific circumstances. Results indicate that these changes in unfollowing and long-term sales are larger if posts are sent in more crowded cities or during commuting hours (suggesting that the stress formed by personal crowding and the follower's environment may play a key role in followers' reactions to social media postings). These results underscore the potential downsides of sending blanket, non-customized, messages to followers, notably during times of intense psychological stress, as well as avenues to avoid such pitfalls. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

Very few studies have been carried out in this field, with contradictory results and using an aggregate data while, according to different authors, an aggregate data might provide spurious results. The author used Ordinary Least Squares Regressions (OLS) and Granger Causality tests to explore the strength and direction of the relationship between insurance and economic growth at an aggregate level. To check the relationship at disaggregate level life insurance, marine insurance, and property insurance are regressed on trade openness and investment, respectively. Non-life insurance at an aggregate level plays a positive and significant role in promoting economic growth, but life insurance has an insignificant impact on the Pakistan economy. On the other hand, non-life insurances at a disaggregated level such as marine insurance negatively affect a vital part of economic growth, i.e., trade. At the same time, property insurance has a significant and positive role in boosting investment. Life, marine, and property insurance Granger cause economic growth, trade, and investment in a single direction. Nevertheless, is a bi-directional relationship between economic growth and non-life insurance. © 2020.

Academic/practical relevance: This paper contributes to a recent thrust in the operations-management literature on how various sorts of transparency influence social and environmental responsibility in a supply chain. In practice, companies are under pressure to publish their supplier lists and suppliers' violations, and some are beginning to do so. This paper could help guide their decisions. Methodology: The methodology is game theory. Results: This paper shows how a buying firm can use transparency to reward a supplier for responsibility effort to eliminate social or environmental violations. By publishing its supplier list, the buying firm can signal that a supplier is responsible and generate profitable new business for the supplier. However, the resulting competition for the supplier's scarce capacity could cause the buying firm to obtain fewer units or pay a higher price. We identify the conditions under which a buying firm should commit to publish its supplier list and conditions under which the buying firm should also help a supplier with cost reduction or capacity expansion. In addition, the paper shows how a buying firm can use transparency to punish a supplier for a responsibility violation-by warning other buying firms not to source from that supplier. Commitment to do so increases the supplier's responsibility effort and can screen out a supplier with a known responsibility violation, thereby increasing a buying firm's expected profit. If the supplier is uncertain whether it has a violation (e.g., faulty electrical wiring likely to cause a fire), then the two forms of transparency can be complementary. Managerial implications: Buying firms should consider transparency as a potentially profitable approach to mitigating social and environmental violations in their supply chains.

The model generates futures prices, expected spot prices and time-varying risk premiums for different maturities. Results show that between October 2010 and June 2018 both exchanges exhibit a positive average risk premium for each maturity. The risk premiums for both exchanges are also shown to be stochastic, with short maturities having higher average values and greater volatility. In addition, the futures prices of COMEX values were greater than those LME with a mean difference of 0.477% and the LME exhibits higher averages values than COMEX for expected spot prices and risk premiums, with differences of 0.438% and 0.354%, respectively. As for risk premium volatility, the estimate for COMEX is 0.993% greater than that for LME. Statistically significant evidence is also given for the cointegration of the two markets. An empirical analysis shows that the main determinants of the variation in copper risk premiums are variations in COMEX inventories, hedging pressure, the default premium, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index and the return on the NASDAQ Emerging Market Index.

Using a behavioral perspective, we propose that an activist's reputation for being confrontational conveys information to the target company as to what they are likely to encounter in an activist campaign. To avoid the potential adverse consequences of engaging in such a contest, we propose and find that target companies are more likely to settle with an activist known for being confrontational. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by providing insight into the importance of the social context surrounding activist campaigns and the role of reputation in influencing how companies respond to activist investors. Managerial Summary: Given that hedge fund activism is having a major impact on firm's strategic and financial decision-making, it is important to understand how these activist investors influence companies. An activist campaign is a highly disruptive event leading to considerable ambiguity and uncertainty as to what is likely to transpire. Given this information void, our study finds that the board and management respond based on the reputation of the activist investor that has taken a stake in the company. That activist investors with a reputation for being hostile are more successful may be a defensive response on the part of management in order to avoid the potential adverse consequences of a hostile campaign. This has implications for corporate governance and the fiduciary duty of the board. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","activist hedge funds; corporate governance; executive decision-making; market signaling; reputation","Decision making; Uncertainty analysis; Wooden fences; Corporate governance; Disruptive event; Financial decisions; Hedge Funds; Social context; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088553520

However, research thus far has overlooked the possibility that cognitive effects might also shape selection. This study redresses this imbalance by examining nonmarket selection, focusing for that purpose on the regulatory review of innovations. It proposes that the more knowledge about different technologies is available to regulatory agencies, the more evaluation incongruities they face when evaluating a focal innovation, which increases the time for its regulatory review. It also proposes that this effect is attenuated when regulatory agencies are more frequently confronted with innovations drawing on new technologies. By elucidating cognitive effects that shape nonmarket selection, this study has theoretical implications for research on technological evolution and organizational learning. Managerial summary: This study highlights influences on the regulatory review of innovations, an important hurdle that firms in many industries must clear before launching innovations into the market. The regulatory review of an innovation is largely thought to be facilitated by knowledge about that innovation and the technology on which it builds. But, this view overlooks that knowledge about other technologies that exist in the same domain of an innovation can create evaluation incongruities that hamper its regulatory review, extending its regulatory review time. This effect is attenuated when regulatory agencies are more frequently confronted with new technologies, which makes them more aware of distinctions that different technologies entail, thus reducing incongruities in the review of subsequent innovations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","evaluation routines; nonmarket selection; organizational cognition; organizational learning; technological evolution","Management; Planning; Cognitive effects; Evolutionary models; Organizational adaptation; Organizational learning; Regulatory agencies; Regulatory review; Selection environments; Technological evolution; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087553867

Research has demonstrated the lack of realised value within many such projects, yet construction management academics continue to examine ways of increasing, implementing and optimising this approach in practice, even encouraging its adoption worldwide despite growing social and political dissatisfaction. Here, we go beyond what we see as myopic construction management perspectives, placing our body of work firmly within wider economic, political and social contexts. We challenge uncritical academic compliance with a process that demonstrably contributes to economic inequalities, opportunism and exploitation. We confront the lack of criticality in construction management research of PPPs, and call for construction management academics to broaden their research focus and engage in more robust critique and analysis of construction systems, as they are realised in practice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Academic compliance; critical theory; economics; PFI; PPP","Construction; Economics; Academic compliance; Construction management; Construction management research; Construction systems; critical theory; Economic inequality; Public private partnerships; Public-sector projects; Project management; academic performance; compliance; construction industry; economic analysis; management practice; public-private partnership; research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082950961

With one exception, studies have neither explored prospect theory as possible explanations, nor investigated exactly how this prospecting behavior comes to be. We conduct two experiments and demonstrate that a newsvendor, indeed, exhibits prospecting behavior and that this behavior is triggered by the relative value of the overage and the underage costs. These relative values help create a frame of reference that puts the newsvendor in either a gain-frame or a loss-frame. When the overage cost is less than the underage cost, a newsvendor is in a loss-frame and acts in a risk-seeking manner by ordering more than the optimal, and when the overage cost is more than the underage cost, the newsvendor is in a gain-frame and acts in a risk-averse manner by ordering less than the optimal, as prospect theory suggests. We also show the newsvendor does not use mean demand anchoring with insufficient adjustment heuristic to determine either the initial or the subsequent order quantity. The newsvendor is willing to change the decision in response to changes in parameters, consistent with prospect theory. Two forms of feedback are also supplied; however, feedback does not result in improved decision-making with a commensurate reduction in either systematic bias or prospecting behavior. Surprisingly, the newsvendor becomes more risk-seeking over time rather than risk-neutral. We conclude with a discussion of our findings, managerial insights, and possible future directions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioural OR; Decision-Making; Feedback; Newsvendor; Prospect theory; Risk","Decision making; Optimization; Frame of reference; Newsvendor problem; Order quantity; Possible futures; Prospect theory; Relative value; Risk neutrals; Systematic bias; Decision theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085747371

There is, however, little academic research on the role and significance of tourism in onshore-windfarm development disputes. The paper addresses this gap by way of a nuanced analysis of mixed-methods research undertaken on behalf of Northumberland County Council (NCC), UK, on the impacts of onshore-windfarms on tourism in Northumberland’s rural hinterland. We also trace the influence the research has had on NCC’s policy and land-use decision-making practices in the years since the research was completed in 2014, with particular focus on national policy changes enacted in 2016 that gave local communities more decision-making power on the siting of onshore-windfarms across the UK. From here we critique democratic decision-making on the development of onshore-windfarms more generally and consider political lessons learned from this case study that can have resonance anywhere wrestling with the same or similar issues. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","evidence; landscape; Onshore-windfarms; oppositional discourses; politics; tourism","decision making; national politics; rural area; tourism; wind farm; wind turbine; England; Northumberland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087560339

Actions are assessed according to multiple criteria and assigned to one or more categories. A set of reference actions is used to define each category. The assignment of an action to a given category depends on the comparison of the action to each reference set according to likeness thresholds. Distinct sets of criteria weights, interaction coefficients, and likeness thresholds can be defined per category. When applying CAT-SDto complex decision problems, it may be useful to consider a hierarchy of criteria to give a more intelligible vision of the performances of the considered actions. We propose to apply Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process to CAT-SD to take into account criteria structured in a hierarchical way. On the basis of the known deck of cards method, we also consider an imprecise elicitation of parameters permitting to consider interactions and antagonistic effects between criteria. The elicitation procedure we are proposing can be applied to any Electre method. With the purpose of exploring the assignments obtained by CAT-SD considering possible sets of parameters, we propose to apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). The SMAA methodology allows to draw statistical conclusions on the classification of the actions. The proposed method, SMAA-hCat-SD, helps the decision maker to check the effects of the variation of parameters on the classification at different levels of the hierarchy. We propose also a procedure, based on the concept of loss function, to get a deterministic classification fulfilling some requirements given by the decision maker and taking into account the hierarchy of criteria and the probabilistic assignments obtained through SMAA. Also this procedure can be applied to any classification Electre method. The application of the new proposal is shown through an example. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Deck of cards method; Deterministic classification; Hierarchy of criteria; Interaction effects; Loss function; Multiple criteria decision aiding; Robust optimization","Decision support systems; Stochastic systems; Antagonistic effects; Interaction coefficient; Multi-criteria classification; Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding; Multiple criteria hierarchy process; Probabilistic assignments; Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses (SMAA); Variation of Parameters; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084729983

Findings: The author finds that there is a threshold level of economic freedom that determines if corruption reduces the per capita income in a state. According to the FMOLS estimations, the negative effects of corruption on income decrease as economic freedom increases, and they eventually disappear. Originality/value: This is the first study investigating the intricate relationship between corruption, economic freedom and economic performance using data from US states. The study uses a news-based measure of corruption constructed by Dincer and Johnston (2017), which has several advantages over the convictions-based measure used in previous studies analyzing the relationship between corruption and growth using US data.

Reconfigurable process planning (RPP) reconstructs the optimal process planning for each batch according to different part batches based on commonality. In combination with the optimal crowdsourcing contracting (OCC) strategy, RPP helps release fixed capital and increase the flexibility of the enterprise under the requirement of diversified parts. The coupling of process planning and crowdsourcing contracting decisions is inherent in open manufacturing. This paper focuses on coordinated optimization underlying OCC with RPP. An OCC decision-making mechanism considering RPP based on Stackelberg game theory is established, which provides a solution for trade-offs between the RPP decision-maker and the OCC decision-maker. A coordinated optimization model is proposed to reveal the hierarchical relationships and is solved by a nesting genetic algorithm. A case study of a group of rotating shaft parts is taken to illustrate the effectiveness of the bilevel coordinated optimization (BCO) model. The results present that the commonality has an apparent impact on the OCC and RPP decisions in open manufacturing, and integrating it into process planning activities is advisable for platform enterprises to increase production efficiency and competitive advantages. Our proposed model can deal with the conflict and coordination between OCC and RPP and balances the benefits of platform enterprise with the optimal contractor impacts triggered by planning activities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bilevel optimization; Open manufacturing; Open manufacturing ecommerce platform; Optimal crowdsourcing contracting; Reconfigurable process planning","Competition; Crowdsourcing; Data Analytics; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Game theory; Genetic algorithms; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Manufacture; Process planning; Competitive advantage; Coordinated optimization; Decision-making mechanisms; Increase productions; Manufacturing paradigm; Manufacturing resource; Platform enterprise; Stackelberg Games; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089505513

This is commonly known as the revenue change prediction problem. In practical real-world environments, the importance of having adequate revenue change prediction capability primarily stems from scarcity of resources (in particular, sales team personnel or technical consultants) that are needed to respond to different revenue change scenarios including predicted revenue growth or shrinkage. It becomes important to make actionable decisions; that is, decisions related to prioritizing clients or service offerings to which these scarce resources are to be allocated. The contribution of the current work is twofold. First, we propose a framework for conducting revenue change prediction through casting it as a classification problem. Second, since datasets associated with revenue change prediction are typically imbalanced, we develop a new methodology for solving the classification problem such that we achieve maximum prediction precision while minimizing sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We validate our proposed framework through real-world datasets acquired from a major global provider of cloud computing services, and benchmark its performance against standard classifiers from previous works in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","(D) Analytics; Bayesian optimization; Classification; Imbalanced datasets; Machine learning; Revenue change prediction","Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Shrinkage; Business environments; Cloud computing services; Imbalanced Data-sets; Prediction precision; Predictive precision; Real world environments; Real-world datasets; Technical consultants; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083065420

Nevertheless, there are theoretical concerns regarding the generalization, external validity and temporal validity of case studies. Methodologically, this study provides an explicit procedure to expand grounded inductive research to incorporate insights from outside the literature (e.g. interviews conducted during fieldwork) through an existence approach. This approach focuses on the most salient items in a set of qualitative interviews. This qualitative evidence then informs precise modelling. The approach is applied to a case study on the Brazilian beef industry. Brazil is the second largest beef exporter in the world, and multinational companies experience difficulties regarding their commitment to zero deforestation in their supply chains. The insights from interviews are related to difficulties experienced by companies in the beef supply chain regarding their commitment to zero deforestation and are distilled into statements on supply-chain coordination failures and consumers’ unwillingness to pay for “greener” beef. The final model links the concept of Shapley value to environmentally-related investments and returns within supply chains. Finally, we analyze how supply chains can overcome coordination failures and improve sustainability and financial performance, thereby generating cleaner production through industry associations, non-governmental organizations, or large companies’ initiatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coordination; Deforestation; Efficiency; Induction; Qualitative methodology; Risk management; Supply chain; Sustainability","Deforestation; Pollution control; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Environmental outcome; Financial performance; Industry association; Industry specific products; Multi-national companies; Nongovernmental organizations; Qualitative interviews; Supply chain coordination; Beef",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085649660

The presence of a guarantee strongly steered buyers to these guaranteed sellers, but offering guarantees did not increase sales overall, suggesting financial risk was not determinative for the marginal buyer. This preference for guaranteed sellers was not the result of their lower financial risk, but rather because buyers viewed the platform's decision to guarantee as informative about relative seller quality.

The majority of development thus far has been via publicly-funded programmes led by government laboratories focused on scientific research and in which commercialisation strategy and innovation play a minor role. Generally, such programmes follow a linear model of innovation in which commercial aspects are not considered until later in development. In consequence and without intention, devices not well-suited for commercial application are being pursued. In recent years, however, privately funded fusion start-ups have emerged with the goal of accelerating the commercialisation of fusion. Fusion start-ups are, by necessity, operating on a fundamentally different model of innovation: agile innovation, whereby technology is developed flexibly and iteratively towards an explicit commercial goal. Technology Roadmapping is a method that has been effective for supporting agile innovation but thus far has had limited application to mission-led hardware development. We characterise the key features of the fusion innovation approach and create a novel Technology Roadmapping process for fusion start-ups, which is developed via a case study with Tokamak Energy Ltd.

This presents statistical challenges because the bivariate temperature–humidity (measured here by dew point) distribution is complex and spatially variable. Here, we develop a flexible, semiparametric model based on quantile smoothing splines to summarize the distributional dependence of dew point on temperature, including how the dependence is changing with increasing global mean temperature. Noncrossing constraints enforce both the validity of the modeled distributions and the physical constraint that dew point cannot exceed temperature. The proposed method is first demonstrated with four synthetic, representative case studies. We then apply it to data from 2416 weather stations spanning the globe, with a focus on analyzing dew point trends during hot days. In general, dew point is increasing on both hot, humid and hot, dry days in the tropics and high latitudes, but decreasing in the subtropics, especially on hot, dry days. These changes appear to be mostly explained by changes in the temperature–dew point relationship, rather than by increases in temperature with a fixed temperature–dew point relationship. © 2020, International Biometric Society.","Dew point; Global Summary of the Day; High-dimensional regularization; Noncrossing quantiles; Quantile regression; Quantile smoothing splines","humid environment; numerical model; regional climate; relative humidity; temperature effect; temperature profile; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084649323

The technical efficiency measure can be complemented with a consistent radial metrics for cost, revenue and profit efficiency in DEA, but only for the setting with known input and output prices. In many real applications of performance measurement, such as the evaluation of utilities, banks and supply chain operations, the input and/or output data are often stochastic and linked to exogenous random variables. It is known from standard results in stochastic programming that rankings of stochastic functions are biased if expected values are used for key parameters. In this paper, we propose economic efficiency measures for stochastic data with known input and output prices. We transform the stochastic economic efficiency models into a deterministic equivalent non-linear form that can be simplified to a deterministic programming with quadratic constraints.

This is particularly important when a revolving-fund approach is used to leverage savings from the initial projects to pay for later improvements. The success of the revolving-fund approach is dependent on the appropriate prioritization of projects. Competing performance measures and scarce resources make this task of project prioritization during the planning stage a complex and challenging endeavour. The current study examined the impact of different project prioritization strategies for revolving-fund sustainability program performance. A novel modeling approach for sustainability decision-analysis was developed using the system dynamics method, and the model was calibrated using a campus sustainability improvement program at a major university. The model was applied to evaluate the effects of five common project-prioritization strategies on three program-performance measures, across a wide range of initial investment levels. For the university case study, we found that the strategy of prioritizing projects according to decreasing benefit/cost ratio performed best. The research demonstrated that using a system dynamics model can allow sustainability program managers to make better-informed sequencing decisions, leading to a financially and environmentally successful program implementations. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

These frontline assessments typically become sales forecasts that are used to allocate resources within the firm. Assessments of future sales, however, are often inaccurate and little is known about how salespeople and sales managers make decisions about sales opportunities, or if they differ in their ability to (correctly) assess the merits of such opportunities. To address this research gap, we explore several decision-making biases – namely optimism, confidence, and overconfidence – through the lenses of both Psychological Momentum (PM) and Strategic Reference Point (SRP) theory.

We develop our hypotheses by building on the literature base that relates to organizational learning. The paper uses a panel dataset spanning the years 2008–2013. The efficiency of the dialysis facilities is operationalized by means of a data envelopment analysis model. This model considers the number of treatments in the dialysis facility as the output variable. The model uses four inputs—number of dialysis stations, number of full-time equivalents of physicians, number of full-time equivalents of clinical staff, and the number of employee hours per week at a dialysis facility. Quality is operationalized by considering facilities’ performance scores on three measures developed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The findings point to distinct effects of chain organization size on quality and efficiency performance of dialysis facilities. Specifically, the results obtained by analyzing a dynamic panel data model show that chain organization size has an inverse U-shaped curvilinear effect on quality outcomes and a U-shaped curvilinear effect on efficiency. The findings suggest that dialysis facilities affiliated with chain organizations of varying sizes experience learning effects and causal ambiguities depending on the specific performance measure under consideration.

In this study, we examine a store manager's choice of which stock-keeping units (SKUs) from a given category to assign to a promotional display space. While the academic literature and retail software solution providers offer a variety of optimization solutions for the assortment optimization problem, there is very little guidance for retailers on how to optimally determine when and what products to place on their promotional display space. Consequently, retailers often default to simple heuristics, which are typically suboptimal from a profit maximization standpoint, when making this decision. Thus, there is a need for a decision support tool to facilitate the product selection for promotional display space. Using a grocery store sales transaction data set, we demonstrate how to measure the incremental lift in sales of placing a particular SKU on promotional display space. Our optimization model includes the incremental lifts (from the estimation method) combined with the estimated base-sales rates and profit margins of each SKU so that the profit-maximizing SKU can be chosen for a promotional display space for each week of the year. Placing a SKU on promotional display can result in a significant lift in sales. For example, the estimated average display effect (i.e., sales lift) for the beer category across all SKUs and all weeks is 27%, which makes promotional display a very effective tool for stimulating incremental product sales. Overall, our methodology results in at least 1.6 times improvement in incremental profit when compared to a common industry benchmark. We also test our methodology on two additional product categories and demonstrate that it performs equally well across product categories. Our work provides an easy-to-implement, promotional display SKU-selection methodology that includes both an estimation and an optimization model. Our estimation model can handle an extensive and complex product assortment and accounts for important aspects of promotional activities such as the cannibalization of the inner aisle sales and halo effects. Our optimization model is flexible enough to consider practical aspects such as common business rules that restrict the selection of the same SKU over a consecutive set of weeks, display-related changeover costs, and slotting fees offered by the manufacturers. Overall, our study underscores the importance of making effective promotional display decisions. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","grocery retailers; optimization; promotion","Beer; Decision support systems; Industrial plants; Optimization; Profitability; Sales; Assortment optimization; Decision support tools; Grocery retailer; Optimization modeling; Optimization solution; promotion; Promotional activities; Promotional displays; Flexible displays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076739322

Most of these forecasts are based on epidemiology models that utilize deterministic differential equations and have resulted in widely varying predictions. We propose a new discrete-Time Markov chain model that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which parameter estimation is straightforward from available data. Using such data from China's Hubei province (for which Wuhan is the provincial capital city and which accounted for approximately 82% of the total reported COVID-19 cases in the entire country), the model is shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate. As a result, it has been adopted by the first Shanghai assistance medical team in Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which was the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients in the world. The forecast has been used for preparing medical staff, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical resources and for supporting real-Time medical management decisions. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co.","analytics; coronavirus; COVID-19; epidemics; Markov chain; pandemic; predictive analytics; predictive modeling; simulation; stochastic models; transition matrix model","Differential equations; Forecasting; Human resource management; Markov chains; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Critical care; Discrete time Markov chains; Forecasting models; Hubei Province; Medical management; New approaches; Predictive modeling; Stochastic behavior; Intensive care units",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086143290

One reason for the omission is that for service industries, firm level energy utilization is most commonly measured in kilowatt hours per square meter of office space where changes often related to the space rather than the firm performance. The measure also presents several problems for firms in service industries. First, energy conservation and reduction may be counterproductive for service firms that are growing and require energy to sustain that growth. Second, it may not relate to national and international goals which are often focused on the amount of carbon dioxide produced generating energy than the total amount of energy consumed. Third, it treats energy as a utility rather than a resource in firms’ value creation. Results from a field study focused on service firms in Sweden suggests that focusing on energy productivity overcomes the limitations of existing measures and produces positive results. By conceptualizing energy productivity as output per unit of energy, we create a conservation metric that enables service firms to measure their contributions to energy consumption relative to national economic growth. As a result, energy productivity aligns the interests of service organizations with those of policy makers and conservationists. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abductive research; Corporate social responsibility; Energy conservation; Energy productivity; Service organizations","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Office buildings; Productivity; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Economic growths; Energy metrics; Energy productivity; Firm Performance; National agendas; Service organizations; Strategic decision making; Service industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079352666

Performance measures are given higher weight if they statistically appear to be more strongly correlated with this hidden factor. We show how this approach, when applied to measures that are weakly or not correlated with each other, can effectively ignore measures and can exhibit ""knife-edge""instability, so that even if hospitals improve relative to all other hospitals, they may nonetheless score lower overall because of weight shifting onto different measures than before. In contrast, we provide an approach to scoring and ranking hospitals that, under reasonable conditions, ensures that hospitals that improve relative to all other hospitals obtain higher scores, while also having the capability to autonomously adjust weights as measures are added or subtracted over time. Rather than exploit statistical correlation, we propose a conic optimization framework that offers a new integrated approach in data envelopment analysis for simultaneous efficiency analysis and performance evaluation. We develop theory that explains the behaviour of our approach, including various properties satisfied by hospital scores at optimality. Using data, we apply our approach to score and rank nearly every hospital in the United States and demonstrate the extent to which it agrees or disagrees with the existing approach to the CMS star ratings. © 2020 The Author(s).","Conic programming; Data envelopment analysis; Healthcare; Hospitals; Input-output analysis","Data envelopment analysis; Health insurance; Stars; Centers for medicare and medicaid services; Efficiency analysis; Efficient frontier; Hospital performance; Integrated approach; Latent variable modeling; Performance measure; Statistical correlation; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091667034

In a series of six experiments, we find that the choice of presenting data as stocks or flows can have a consequential impact on judgments. The same data can lead to positive or negative assessments when presented as stocks versus flows and can engender optimistic or pessimistic forecasts for the future. For example, when employment data from 2007 to 2013 are shown as flows (jobs created or lost), President Obama's impact on the economy during his first year in office is viewed positively, whereas when the same data are shown as stocks (total jobs), his impact is viewed negatively. The results highlight a challenge that accompanies the growing reliance on data and analytics for decision making within organizations: seemingly benign choices-such as that between two informationally equivalent data presentations-can substantively impact how data are interpreted and used, even though the underlying information is the same.

The seller faces a partially uninformed population of consumers, interconnected through a directed social network. In the network, the seller offers rewards to informed consumers (influencers) conditional on inducing purchases by uninformed consumers (influenced). Rewards are needed to bear a communication cost and to induce word of mouth (WOM) either privately (cost per contact) or publicly (fixed cost to inform all friends). From the seller's viewpoint, eliciting Private WOM is more costly than eliciting Public WOM. We investigate (1) the incentives for the seller to move to a denser network, inducing either Private or Public WOM, and (2) the optimal mix between the two types of communication. A denser network is found to be always better not only for information diffusion but also for seller's profits, as long as Private WOM is concerned. Differently, under Public WOM, the seller may prefer an environment with less competition between informed consumers, and the presence of highly connected influencers (hubs) is the main driver to make network density beneficial to profits. When the seller is able to discriminate between Private and Public WOM, the optimal strategy is to cheaply incentivize the more connected people to pass on the information publicly and then offer a high bonus for Private WOM.

We control for individual fixed effects in the life-satisfaction equations and instrument for income in some models. We find values for avoiding pain ranging between 56–145 USD per day. These results are lower than previously reported and suggest that the higher previous estimates may be heavily affected by the highest income level and confounded by endogeneity in the income variable.

The specific cases p = 1, p = 2 and p = ∞ are separately discussed and analyzed. In particular, for p = 1 and p = ∞, a lexicographic optimization approach is proposed in order to guarantee uniqueness of the obtained target. The original CP method is translation invariant and has been adapted so that the proposed CP-DEA is also units invariant. An lp metric-based efficiency score is also defined for each DMU. The proposed CP-DEA approach can also be utilized in the presence of preference information, non-discretionary or integer variables and undesirable outputs.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey resulted in 276 responses from wine consumers residing in Texas, USA. Information source usage was tested in two common purchasing situations: for casual and formal consumption. Chi-square analyses and ANOVA were used to examine differences among the generational cohorts in their use of information sources, levels of objective and subjective wine knowledge, wine involvement and risk perception for the two purchasing situations. Findings: Younger consumers were found to be significantly more inclined to use Web 2.0 information sources, such as wine blogs, wine applications, their contacts’ recommendations on social media and wine experts on social media. Older consumers were more likely to use their own wine knowledge. Of greater interest is that in terms of their reliance on various wine information sources, Generation X behaves as the bridge between Generation Y and Baby Boomers. Generational differences regarding wine involvement, wine knowledge and risk perception also support this notion. Practical implications: The results of this study reinforce the need for wineries to adopt or create strategic initiatives using Web 2.0 elements. This study also suggests that depending on the purchasing context, consumers use certain information sources more than others. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of the information acquisition process by expanding the types of information sources, and also yields valuable insights for consumers’ off-premise wine purchasing decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Generational cohort theory; Information sources; Perceived risk; Survey research; Surveys; Wine consumer behaviour; Wine involvement; Wine knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077149259

Contemporary tight carbon reduction targets urge the need to deploy renewable energy technologies however due to interdependencies across the WEF nexus, various technologies are beneficial for some but not all sectors. This paper quantifies the impacts of future possible AD technology diffusion choices on the environment, society and economy. This can aid decision makers to identify the potential consequences of various AD alternatives within the next three decades. The study considers an integrated WEF nexus approach and accounts for the interdependencies within the nexus. This was done by developing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) and simulating the relations between the main players within the nexus, thus examining the upscaling of AD diffusion and its consequences for water consumption, energy production, transportation, landfill use, food waste processing and digestate generation. Three future WEF nexus scenarios, that reflect potential alternatives of society and technology in Great Britain up to 2050, were utilised by the ABM implementation to test the sensitivity of AD diffusion choices. These scenarios describe possible changes to lifestyle, governance, technologies, climate, and social structures. Accounting for the uncertainty associated with such future simulations, the Monte Carlo method was employed to estimate the potential variations in scenario outputs. Results suggest that decentralisation results in the largest carbon reduction, but can incur more costs. Centralisation consumes 35% more water but produces 37% more energy (biogas). The paper has visualised the scenario outputs graphically to highlight the consequences of neglecting the inter-relationships between environmental, social and economic aspects of AD. © 2019","Agent-based model; Anaerobic digestion; Future scenarios; Uncertainty; Water-energy-food nexus","Autonomous agents; Carbon; Computational methods; Decision making; Diffusion; Economics; Monte Carlo methods; Renewable energy resources; Simulation platform; Uncertainty analysis; Agent-based model; Future scenarios; Potential variations; Renewable energy technologies; Society and technologies; Uncertainty; Various technologies; Water energy; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077324971

Our empirical results find that online channel improves profit efficiency (i.e. a positive return) of the adopting banks. Even though cost efficiency deteriorates, such improvement attributes to the rise in non-interest income efficiency. In reference to risk management, online channel weakens loan quality of the adopting banks, which also raises their solvency risk accordingly. Overall, our results suggest that online channel increases the return of adoption banks albeit at a higher risk.

Although the strategic implications of sourcing structures have received considerable attention in theory and practice, their implications from a project execution standpoint—specifically, in terms of execution efficiency—remain under-researched. Based on a large primary dataset on IT projects with distributed sourcing structures, this paper documents the findings of a theoretically grounded, empirical investigation using stochastic frontier analysis that evaluates whether and to what extent does the execution efficiency of projects vary across various types of sourcing structures (namely, Domestic-Insourcing, Domestic-Outsourcing, Offshore-Insourcing, and Offshore-Outsourcing). The results provide support for differential effects of crossing a firm or country boundary, or both boundaries, on the execution efficiency of IT projects. Specifically, we find that the execution efficiency of IT projects is significantly lower when their sourcing structures cross a country boundary (Offshore-Insourcing and Offshore-Outsourcing) relative to when their sourcing structures do not cross a country boundary (Domestic-Insourcing and Domestic-Outsourcing). Notwithstanding these trends across sourcing structures, a split-sample analysis of execution efficiency levels reveals that each structure presents a viable alternative for managers to realize high levels of execution efficiency. Finally, additional analysis highlights the benefits of sourcing structure capabilities—as represented by the extent of risk management planning and agile project management—in improving execution efficiency in IT projects that cross a country boundary. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","agile project management; execution efficiency; offshoring; outsourcing; risk management; sourcing structure","Efficiency; Large dataset; Offshore oil well production; Project management; Risk assessment; Risk management; Stochastic systems; Agile project management; Comparative evaluations; Domestic outsourcing; Empirical investigation; Information technology projects; Off-shoring; Offshore Outsourcing; Stochastic frontier analysis; Outsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076154538

The literature often assumes deterministic time of serving each demand and that the distribution of uncertainty is fully known. In this paper, we consider a new class of revenue management problems inspired by emerging applications such as cloud computing and city parking, where we dynamically determine prices for multiple products sharing limited resource and aim to maximize the expected revenue over a finite horizon. Random demand of each product arrives in each period, modeled by a function of the arrival time, product type, and price. Unlike the traditional monopolistic pricing, here each demand stays in the system for uncertain time. Both demand and service time follow ambiguous distributions, and we formulate robust deterministic approximation models to construct efficient heuristic fixed-price pricing policies. We conduct numerical studies by testing cloud computing service pricing instances based on data published by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for managing revenue and risk under various distributions of demand and service time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Demand and service time uncertainty; Dynamic pricing; Risk management; Robust optimization","Cloud computing; Economics; Optimization; Risk management; Web services; Amazon web services; Cloud computing services; Deterministic approximation; Dynamic pricing; Emerging applications; Revenue management; Robust optimization; Service time; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072290644

Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology is mixed methods and survey-based combining quantitative Likert scaling with open-ended questions. Findings: At the 99 percent confidence level, surveyed respondents believe that, on average, the coaching process has provided results above the investment required and has led to progress for them and their organizations. Of the six targeted areas, five showed a very positive relationship between the coaching experience and the results from its clients. Research limitations/implications: As the research is based on a convenience sample it has shortcomings relative to probability sampling. However, it is widely recognized that such samples can be attained more easily, more rapidly, and at less cost than probability-based samples. On the other hand, it is understood that inferences to broader populations of interest are limited. Practical implications: The results confirm findings from past research such as that reported by the Institute of Coaching (2018), that managers should not undervalue potential contributions to individual and company attributes from coaching. Originality/value: The motivation for this paper is to bring together both academic and practitioner experience to provide more evidence and understanding related to the coaching definition, its implementation, and effectiveness. While not conclusive in the absolute sense, the original data original collected and analyzed for this research is based on known client contacts in close time proximity to the coaching engagement and delivers added insight to current research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Coaching; Management; Self-efficacy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081364053

This difference will have implications on the extent of entrepreneurship as a driver of Indian economic growth. The aim of this paper is to fill this research gap. Furthermore, one of the central premises of this paper is that the economic reforms in China have provided an incentive for the Chinese to embrace their uniquely cultural entrepreneurial skills. However, this has not happened in isolation because the reforms have targeted all sectors of the economy; the most important of these reforms for entrepreneurial facilitation has been associated with infrastructure, education, property rights, ownership restructuring and foreign direct investment. In this case, changes in infrastructure, knowledge creation and knowledge spillovers have led indirectly to China’s economic growth. This is because knowledge spillovers have been facilitated by entrepreneurship. Moreover, this process has been characterised by the dynamic nature of institutional change in China. Nevertheless, in India at state level, there is variation in the level of economic, institutional and infrastructural development. Furthermore, there is also a tendency for firms in India to remain small. This may be due to the country’s rigid labour laws. The findings of this paper indicate that entrepreneurship is stronger in China than in India from an economic, cultural and a historical perspective. Private entrepreneurship has been stimulated in China by the incrementally evolving economic reforms which resulted in the dynamic nature of institution formation. However, private entrepreneurship in India remains constrained by institutional factors and institutional rigidity. Nevertheless, social entrepreneurship is more prevalent in India than in China. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","China; Economic growth; Entrepreneurship; India; Innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081251612

Nevertheless, there exists a unique Strong Nash equilibrium. We show that there is an efficient and fair fixed-rate revenue-sharing contract which induces the system optimal outcome in the Strong Nash equilibrium.

We show that there does not exist a fixed-rate revenue-sharing contract that induces the system optimum. We quantify that the efficiency of a JV which decreases with the number of participants, the cost asymmetry and the cost margin of the JV.

Because each activity contributes only a partial result and depends on others to complete an intended change, constraining one can create a bottleneck that traps multiple other activities. For my empirical analysis, I leverage the staggered adoptions of employment protection laws intended to constrain one specific adjustment to one specific resource: dismissing employees. The constraint, however, not only affects the contraction but also the expansion in labor as well as capital investments, acquisition, divestiture, CEO turnover, and other adjustments, and increases (shortens) the persistence of negative (positive) performance. The expansive interdependencies are critical to understanding firm rigidity and resilience, implementation failures, and the persistence of firm performance. Managerial Summary: This study shows how executing even a seemingly straightforward improvement requires piecing together a series of interdependent corporate strategic activities. As a result, a constraint on just one is sufficient to foil a successful firm response. Using changes in employment laws, I show that a firm's ability to dismiss employees not only affects firing, but also hiring, capital investments, acquisition, divestiture, and CEO turnover, and increases (shortens) the persistence of negative (positive) performance. Underestimating the complex and interdependent nature of these activities can lead to bias-for-action and contribute to implementation failures, such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and a post-merger integration process that fails to realize expected synergies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adaptation; corporate strategy; employment protection; interdependencies; rigidity","Employment; Mergers and acquisitions; Personnel; Rigidity; adaptation; Capital investment; Corporate strategies; Empirical analysis; Firm Performance; interdependencies; Post-merger integrations; Strategic activities; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075009359

First-response decisions, because of the conditions under which they are executed, offer researchers an interesting and relevant context for the study of intuitive decision making in organizations. We used qualitative methods to explore how “peak performing” police officers used intuition in first-response decisions. Our findings show that intuition’s role in first-response occurs in two differing but complementary ways: “recognition-based intuition” and “intuition-based inquiry”. This finding builds on previous intuition research and informs current debates in behavioural sciences regarding “default-intervention” versus “parallel-competitive” variants of dual-process theory; it also reveals how a complex and situated mix of intuition and analysis can guide effective decision making and support peak performance in uncertain, dynamic and complex environments that typify many organizational decision processes. Our findings contribute to intuition research by extending the current theory of “intuition-as-expertise” in going beyond a simple “recognize-and-respond” model.

The model aims to build a strong team by selecting the proper members who can help the team improve its performance. Specifically, a genetic algorithm is designed to find solutions for the proposed model. Covering and the positive cooperative effect indicator are applied to describe the interpersonal relationship among team candidates. In addition, the effect aggregation operator is adopted to find solutions for the positive team formation model.

The relational nature of social procurement policies requires construction firms to develop new collaborative partnerships with organisations from the government, not-for-profit and community sectors. The aim of this paper is to address the paucity of research into the risks and opportunities of entering into these new cross-sector partnerships from the perspectives of the stakeholders involved and how this affects collaborative potential and social value outcomes for intended beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach: This case study research is based on a unique collaborative intermediary called Connectivity Centre created by an international contractor to coordinate its social procurement strategies. The findings draw on a thematic analysis of qualitative data from focus groups with 35 stakeholders from the construction, government, not-for-profit, social enterprise, education and employment sectors. Findings: Findings indicate that potentially enormous opportunities which social procurement offers are being undermined by stakeholder nervousness about policy design, stability and implementation, poor risk management, information asymmetries, perverse incentives, candidate supply constraints, scepticism, traditional recruitment practices and industry capacity constraints. While these risks can be mitigated through collaborative initiatives like Connectivity Centres, this depends on new “relational” skills, knowledge and competencies which do not currently exist in construction. In conclusion, when social procurement policy requirements are excessive and imposed top-down, with little understanding of the construction industry's compliance capacity, intended social outcomes of these policies are unlikely to be achieved. Originality/value: This research draws on theories of cross-sector collaboration developed in the realm of public sector management to address the lack of research into how the new cross-sector partnerships encouraged by emerging social procurement policies work in the construction industry. Contributing to the emerging literature on cross-sector collaboration, the findings expose the many challenges of working in cross-sector partnerships in highly transitionary project-based environments like construction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Construction industry; Corporate social responsibility; Intermediaries; Risk management; Social procurement","Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Profitability; Risk management; Case study research; Collaborative partnerships; Cross-sector collaborations; Design/methodology/approach; Information asymmetry; Procurement strategy; Public sector management; Recruitment practice; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094593046

This paper focuses on the mesolevel or intra-organizational system that includes the sales and marketing functions. This paper examines distinct tensions at three levels of the firm’s hierarchy and the mechanisms used to manage the tensions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a qualitative data collection. A discovery-oriented process is used to understand the interconnections that exist among marketing-sales dyads at three organizational levels across several firms. Findings: This paper uncovers distinct tensions and defenses exhibited by managers at each hierarchical level and this paper presents mechanisms that can are used to reduce the tensions. Research limitations/implications: The multi-level perspective demonstrates the value of examining the intra-organizational aspect of the sales ecosystem. This paper uses a qualitative approach to highlight that sales-marketing tensions are unique to each of the hierarchical levels. This paper demonstrates that the tensions are a function of the unique roles each sales and marketing executive has within the organization. Practical implications: To make the sales and marketing interface more effective, managers need to view tensions across the sales-marketing interface as complementary versus opposing forces. Managers must balance these tensions, rather than fight them and/or select one of the alternatives over the other. This paper suggests that paradoxical thinking may be a valued skillset for managers at each level of the organization. Originality/value: The study uses a unique qualitative data set that examines the sales-marketing interface across three levels of an organizational hierarchy. Through this approach, this paper delineates specific tensions between marketing and sales within each level of the firm. This paper also describes mechanisms to manage the tensions common within the sales-marketing interface. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecological systems; Grounded theory; Marketing-sales interface; Paradox; Sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094114700

As other countries globally, the UK is keen on economic development and investment in smart-city missions to create interest in monetary environment and inward investment. This paper aims to explore the driving forces of smart road transport transformation and implementation in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: The study involved interviews with 16 professionals from the UK road transport sector. A semi-structured interview technique was used to collect experts' perception, which was then examined using content analysis. Findings: The results of the study revealed that the technological advancement is a key driver. The main challenges faced during the implementation of smart-city elements in the UK road network are lack of investment, maintenance, state of readiness and the awareness of the smart road transport concept. The study concludes that an understanding of the concept of smart cities from a road transport perspective is very important to create awareness of the benefits and the way it works. A wider collaboration between every sector is crucial to create a successful smart city. Originality/value: The study contributes to the field of digitalisation of road transport sector.

Compared with the product market competition, the identification and prediction of labor market competitors have garnered little attention in the literature. In this study, we perform an interfirm labor market competitor analysis with a unique longitudinal employer-employee matched data set derived from online profiles of 89,943 employees, tracking their careers in 3,467 public firms from the years 2000 to 2014. Using employee migrations across firms, we derive and analyze a human capital flow network. We leverage this network to extract global cues about interfirm human capital overlap through structural equivalence and community classification. The online employee profiles also provide rich data on the explicit knowledge base of firms. In particular, they allow us to represent firms in the space of the skills possessed by their employees and measure the interfirm human capital overlap in terms of similarity in their employees’ skills. We validate our proposed human capital overlap metrics in a predictive analytics framework using future employee migrations as an indicator of labor market competition. The results show that our proposed metrics have superior predictive power over conventional firm-level economic and human resource measures. We also demonstrate how our proposed metrics and the prediction framework can be incorporated into a comprehensive competitor analysis that includes both product and labor overlap between firms.

This provides researchers with a new lens through which to study and better understand previously unobservable individual decision-making processes. In this study, using a Bayesian learning model with a rich data set consisting of approximately two million fine-grained Global Positioning System (GPS) observations, we analyze the decision-making behavior of 2,467 single-shift taxi drivers in a large Asian city with the objective of understanding key factors that drive the supply side of urban mobility markets. The data set includes detailed taxi GPS trajectories, taxi occupancy data (i.e., whether the taxi is occupied or not), and taxi drivers’ daily incomes. This capacity to use data for which occupancy of the taxi is known is a distinctive feature of our data set and sets our work apart from prior work in the literature. The specific decisions we focus on pertain to actions drivers take to find new passengers after they have dropped off current passengers. In particular, we study the role of information derivable from GPS trace data (e.g., where passengers were dropped off, where they were picked up, longitudinal taxicab travel history with fine-grained time stamps) observable by or made available to drivers in enabling them to learn the distribution of demand for their services over space and time. We find significant differences between new and experienced drivers in both learning behavior and driving decisions. Drivers benefit significantly from their ability to learn from not only information directly observable in the local market but also aggregate information on demand flows across markets. Interestingly, our policy simulations indicate that information that is noisy at the individual level becomes valuable when aggregated across relevant spatial and temporal dimensions. Moreover, we find that the value of information does not increase monotonically with the scale and frequency of information sharing. Our results also provide important evidence that efficient information sharing can lead to a welfare increase among drivers because of potential market expansion. Efficient information sharing can bring, within the taxi market, additional income-generating opportunities that could be unfulfilled. Overall, this study not only explains driver decision-making behavior but also provides taxi companies with an implementable information-sharing strategy to improve overall market efficiency.

First, human capital theory predicts that internal hires will be immediately more productive than external hires. Second, contextual learning predicts that internal hires will be more productive with time. Finally, theories of commitment, which are rarely applied to this literature, predict that internal advancement enhances retention among high performers (“positive retention”). Applying a general empirical framework for quantifying the relative contributions of these mechanisms to a retailer with 109,063 commissioned salespeople and their 12,931 managers, we find that the gap in our setting is primarily driven by positive retention: High performers and internal hires are less likely to quit, and crucially, high-performing internal hires are especially unlikely to quit. When high-performing internal hires do quit, they tend to cite reasons unrelated to work rather than advancement opportunities. By typically examining performance and retention in isolation, researchers and organizations may be underestimating the importance of internal advancement as a means of retaining of high performers.

Total margin and operating margin were used as profit variables in OLS regressions that were corrected for heteroskedacity. In addition to estimated efficiency, control variables for internal and external correlates of profitability were included in the regression models. We found that more efficient hospitals were also more profitable. The results show a positive relationship between profitability and size, concentration of output, occupancy rate and membership in a multi-hospital system. An inverse relationship was found between profits and academic medical centers, average length of stay, location in a Medicaid expansion state, Medicaid and Medicare share of admissions, and unemployment rate. The results of a Hausman test indicates that efficiency is exogenous in the profit equations.

The basic idea rests on the fact that global DMU's efficiency score might be misleading when managers proceed to reallocate their inputs or redefine their outputs. Literature provides a basic measure for global DMU's efficiency score. A revised model was developed for measuring efficiencies of global DMUs and their inputs (or outputs) efficiency components, based on a hypothesis of virtual DMUs. The present paper suggests a method for measuring global DMU efficiency simultaneously with its efficiencies of inputs components, that we call Input decomposition DEA model (ID-DEA), and its efficiencies of outputs components, that we call output decomposition DEA model (OD-DEA). These twin models differ from Supper efficiency model (SE-DEA) and Common Set Weights model (CSW-DEA). The twin models (ID-DEA, OD-DEA) were applied to agricultural farms, and the results gave different efficiency scores of inputs (or outputs), and at the same time, global DMU's efficiency score was given by the Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (Charnes et al., 1978) [1], CCR78 model. The rationale of our new hypothesis and model is the fact that managers don't have the same information level about all inputs and outputs that constraint them to manage resources by the (global) efficiency scores. Then each input/output has a different reality depending on the manager's decision in relationship to information available at the time of decision. This paper decomposes global DMU's efficiency into input (or output) components' efficiencies. Each component will have its score instead of a global DMU score. These findings would improve management decision making about reallocating inputs and redefining outputs. Concerning policy implications of the DEA twin models, they help policy makers to assess, ameliorate and reorient their strategies and execute programs towards enhancing the best practices and minimising losses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural farms; Data envelopment analysis; DEA Twin models; Efficiency of inputs/outputs; Virtual DMUs","agricultural development; agricultural production; data envelopment analysis; decision making; efficiency measurement; input-output analysis; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085601192

Based on qualitative and quantitative data, we show that ethnic restaurants using a handwritten (vs. printed) menu may enhance perceived authenticity and subsequently elevate purchase intention.

Given the knowledge-intensive nature of their offerings, A/E/C firms that can develop and leverage their knowledge bases are likely to enjoy superior market positions. Based on empirical data collected from 108 A/E/C firms in Vietnam, this study investigated the effect of A/E/C firms' knowledge-management capability (KMC) on their market development performance, and the moderating role of firm size in this relationship. The results revealed that A/E/C firms' KMC positively affects their market development performance, and this positive effect is stronger in small/medium-sized A/E/C firms than in large firms. These findings provide empirical evidence for small/medium-sized A/E/C firms to invest in their knowledge-management infrastructure (e.g., organizational values/norms, policies/procedures, employee development, and information infrastructure) and processes (e.g., socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) to secure superior market positions. Theoretically, this research broadens and deepens understanding of the link between KMC and organizational performance (i.e., market development performance) and the contingent contextual factors (i.e., firm size) in the project-based construction industry. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","A/E/C firms; Construction industry; Knowledge management; Knowledge-management capability; Market development performance; Project-based","Commerce; Construction industry; Investments; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Contextual factors; Employee development; Information infrastructures; Knowledge management capabilities; Knowledge management infrastructure; Market development; Organizational performance; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090913560

In particular, we focus on the impact of the U.S. corporate tax regime on this relation. Exploiting time-series variation and a tax shock, we document that the relatively higher corporate income tax rate and the tax treatment of foreign earnings of U.S. corporations have contributed to a disconnect between the performance of the corporate sector and the overall economy. Specifically, the growth of domestic (national) corporate profits, on average, has outpaced the growth of the domestic (national) economy, and this disconnect increases as the difference between the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the average tax rate of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries increases. The underlying mechanism is fewer corporate profits being channeled into subsequent domestic investments when the U.S. tax rate is relatively higher, leading to lower economic growth.

This methodology can be used both as a planning tool to help policy-makers define policies through scenario simulations, and as an evaluation tool to examine ex-post economic impact once policies have been changed as illustrated herein for the Brazilian case. The paper introduces a mathematical formulation, proposes a state-space graph search approach, and develops an algorithmic solution for a variant of the vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem with intermediate stops (VRTDSPIS), which is especially important in countries with vast territory where long-range freight trucking trips are common. In addition, it is particularly relevant for the economies of emerging markets that may have evolving regulatory frameworks and suboptimal infrastructure environments. Regulatory maximum driving and minimum driver resting time windows impose significant constraints to trucker routines, especially in sparsely populated regions through which long range vehicle trips with full load are common. Such trips can take days to be concluded and numerous alternative routes are possible, each with very different alternatives for refueling and rest. While the literature to date has focused mostly on truck driver scheduling given pre-determined routes and individual country's laws and regulations, this paper proposes a joint solution for the routing and scheduling problem with time window constraints, determining simultaneously a routing and scheduling plan that meets all maximum driving and minimum resting time interval regulatory requirements at minimum cost.

The paper fills the gap by adopting an agent-environment interactionist perspective in the investigation on the interrelation between mobility and entrepreneurship. To be more specific, it deals with two underlying themes. First, the way through which the multi-location experiences and non-local knowledge equip the migrants with the pursuit of opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. Second, the distinctive relationship between the regional environment and opportunity-driven entrepreneurial motives for individuals with and without spatial mobility experiences. These themes are investigated with the China labor-force dynamics survey data, comparing the characteristics and drivers of entrepreneurial motives of the migrants and locals. The survey data presents clear evidence of a higher prevalence of opportunity-driven entrepreneurship in migrant entrepreneurs compared to their local counterparts. Furthermore, the ordered logit regression results demonstrate that spatial mobility experiences significantly promote the likelihood of entering into opportunity-based business. The regional environment exerts impacts on migrants and non-migrants’ entrepreneurial motives, yet in different ways. Local entrepreneurs are more influenced by the endogenous nature of firm ecology in the city, whereas migrant entrepreneurs start business pulled by both local demands and extra-local connectedness to greater market areas. Finally, the paper reflects upon possible implications for a more targeted and inclusive entrepreneurial policy, as well as the future areas of research. © 2019, The Author(s).","Migrant; Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship; Regional entrepreneurial environment; Spatial mobility","Technology transfer; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Human capitals; Migrant; Nascent entrepreneurs; Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship; Ordered logit; Regional entrepreneurial environment; Regional environments; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069644619

Measurements are typically imperfect and costly to obtain. The decision of whether to invest in resource measurement may be influenced by other state variables, for example a resource commodity price. We introduce a mixed-observability model of optimal forest management featuring a partially-observable forest resource and perfectly-observable stochastic price. The decision maker optimizes the expected net present value of forest returns by choosing when to measure current forest volume (conduct an inventory), harvest and replant, or delay action. Parameter values are obtained from numerous forestry data sources. Optimal investment in inventory reduces the cost of uncertainty about timber volume and increases the predictability of returns. Moreover, price stochasticity interacts with inventory decisions to produce asymmetric effects of high and low prices on inventory timing.

However, this topic has been largely neglected in the academic literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical study that aims at achieving an optimal (non-discriminatory) throttling mechanism for bandwidth when user demand is stochastic. In our setting, the demand dynamics of the OSP is governed by a geometric Brownian process. There are costs associated with maintaining and throttling demand; in particular, throttling cost includes both fixed and proportional costs. As users experience inferior service speeds during throttling, the proposed model modifies the demand dynamics to adequately capture users’ reactions to throttling. OSP's objective is to determine the optimal throttling strategy that minimizes the total expected discounted cost of maintaining and throttling demand. By assuming the existence of an optimal strategy, we use a dynamic programming (Quasi-Variational Inequality) approach to show that it is optimal for the OSP to throttle the demand whenever it reaches a threshold level and downgrade the service speed by a fixed factor while the throttling is employed. Our numerical computations strongly suggest that it is always optimal for OSPs to induce negative (demand) growth rates during throttling to reduce unfavorable future demand. Moreover, our comparative statics analysis explains how OSPs should handle user demand with higher growth rates and volatility, service networks that face higher demand fluctuations/volatility during throttling, and the trade-off between non-monetary fixed and proportional cost associated with throttling. © 2020","Bandwidth throttling; OR in service industries; Server/network congestion management; Stochastic optimal control","Bandwidth; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Service industry; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; User experience; Variational techniques; Academic literature; Congestion management; Congestion management tools; Numerical computations; OR in service industries; Quasi variational inequalities; Stochastic optimal control; Throttling mechanism; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081198195

The main challenge in estimating mixture models is that the mixing distribution is often unknown, and imposing a priori parametric assumptions can lead to model misspecification issues. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for nonparametric estimation of the mixing distribution of a mixture of logit models. We formulate the likelihood-based estimation problem as a constrained convex program and apply the conditional gradient (also known as Frank-Wolfe) algorithm to solve this convex program. We show that our method iteratively generates the support of the mixing distribution and the mixing proportions. Theoretically, we establish the sublinear convergence rate of our estimator and characterize the structure of the recovered mixing distribution. Empirically, we test our approach on real-world datasets. We show that it outperforms the standard expectation-maximization (EM) benchmark on speed (16 times faster), in-sample fit (up to 24% reduction in the log-likelihood loss), and predictive (average 28% reduction in standard error metrics) and decision accuracies (extracts around 23% more revenue).

This has added to an already extensive list of challenges due to market size and the concept of economies of scale in AEC industry, to name but a few. Moreover, there is a myth that the AEC industry is bound to stay associated with build-to-order or made-to-order approach caused the AEC industry to restrict modularisation to the component level. This changes the balance in favour of what this paper calls a bottom-up approach. On the other hand, a valid alternative strategy–referred to in this study as top-down strategy–remains very much underexploited. The clients, therefore, do not have a neutral means by which they can assess which strategy is in their best interest. Likewise, if a construction company plans to make a strategic move towards the principles of modularisation and off-site manufacturing, they do not have clear decision support tools. This study investigates these two main modularisation strategies in the AEC industry to provide some examples of successful cases regarding how, when and where such strategy have been applied by different construction companies in different cases.

Household panel data from pastoral areas in northwestern China were analysed. Results suggest an inverse relationship (IR) between land size and the number of livestock per ha. IR can be largely explained by labour input intensity, which is negatively correlated with land size. We find that household’s labour demand is not separable from household’s labour supply and households’ decisions to rent land and hire labour for grazing are significantly related to the labour–land endowment ratio. These findings are consistent with the Chayanovian explanation that labour input intensity varies with farm size due to unobserved interhousehold variation in shadow wage rates. In addition, participation in the labour market does not significantly influence the IR for the employer, while the practice of land renting reduces, but does not eliminate, the IR for the lease. These findings point towards the potential for using factor markets to optimise pasture-based livestock production scale, and the need to promote the factor market development to achieve efficiency in resource use. © 2020 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","China; grassland; inverse relationship; labour market; land rental market; livestock","agricultural labor; agricultural land; labor market; livestock farming; panel data; pastoralism; productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085616261

In addition, we propose a novel estimation method to establish the mathematical relationship between the objectives min((Formula presented.)) and min(TCT) at the production line level. To evaluate the performance of the TOB heuristic, computational experiments are conducted on the classic Taillard's benchmark and one-year historical data from University of Kentucky HealthCare (UKHC).

Therefore, we strive to determine an optimal strategy to manage customer sentiment on social media sites such as Twitter. We also aim to identify factors and external events that can influence the effectiveness of customer care. To understand the antecedents of digital customer care, we model a diffusion process of customer sentiment over time. This diffusion process is influenced (or controlled) by the firm through the strategy employed to respond to customer tweets. We then use real data consisting of sentiments expressed by customers directed at Twitter’s service accounts of four major U.S. telecommunication-service providers (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile) to estimate the parameters in our analytical model and shed several insights into digital customer care in this industry. First, we find a clear separation among the firms in terms of digital customer care effectiveness. Second, we find that good customer care is not merely a matter of responding to customer tweets. Third, the quality of digital customer care that customers expect varies across firms: Customers of higher priced firms (e.g., Verizon and AT&T) expect better customer care. Fourth, seemingly unrelated events (such as signing an exclusive contract with a celebrity) can impact digital customer care. Our study has important implications for managers as it can help firms determine the optimal strategy to influence customer sentiment.

Though the rule's original intent was to clarify conditions for enforcing insider trading laws, generally thought to apply to individuals classified as firm insiders, we find strong use of the rule at the firm level to repurchase company stock. We exploit this new and widespread form of payout to examine an issue at the core of payout decisions-the tradeoff between commitment and financial flexibility. Relative to open market repurchases, preset plans provide an expanded repurchase window and increased legal cover, albeit at the cost of reducing repurchase flexibility and the option to time repurchases. These costs and benefits are significantly associated with Rule 10b5-1 adoption: Firms with alternative sources of financial flexibility are more likely to precommit to a repurchase plan, as are firms with a history of poor repurchase timing and firms constrained by blackout windows. Consistent with preset plans signaling commitment, Rule 10b5-1 repurchase announcements are associated with greater and faster completion rates, with more positive market reactions, and with more dividend substitution than open market repurchases. Lastly, we find that preset repurchase plans represent a unique payout tool whose introduction encouraged a different set of firms to buy back stock and significantly altered the payout landscape. © 2020 INFORMS","Accelerated share repurchase; Announcement returns; Blackout windows; Dividend substitution; Financial crisis; Financial flexibility; Payout policy; Preset trading plan; Repurchase plan completion rates; Rule 10b5-1; Share buyback; Share repurchase","Management; Operations research; Alternative source; Costs and benefits; Financial flexibility; Insider trading; Market reactions; Open market; Trade off; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091042625

Foreign capital is complementing domestic capital well embodying technology and innovations required for expansion of domestic firms in it. Foreign promoters have played quite significant economic roles among firms across production sectors in manufacturing industry in India. Besides sales, total expenses, managerial remunerations and corporation taxes, involvement of foreign promoters are statistically significant determinants of profits, employment and wages among firms across all seven sectors of the manufacturing industry is clear from analysis of the Prowess database for years 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2014. These effects were even stronger in each of Modi–I years between 2015-2019 that followed the Make in India initiative in 2014. Reforms including the outright 100 per cent ownership provision in the automatic route in most industrial sectors have produced good outcomes that have not only raised the volume of FDI per capita from around 16 dollars in 2000 to 285 dollars in 2018 but also raised the global ranking of India to 63 out of 190 economies in 2019 on the ease of doing business, putting India 79 places above now than in 2014. Based on theoretical and empirical analysis it can be concluded that good sentiments of FDI in India in Modi–II years started in 2019 will prevent diminishing returns on capital and contribute towards sustainable growth in coming years.

This paper presents stakeholder opinions of environmental management systems as a means for the construction industry to respond to these issues. Using a previous approach, the views of small and medium construction companies were sought, using questionnaires to ask respondents to reveal their perceived benefits of and barriers to implementing the ISO 14000 suite of environmental management standards in the UK. Detailed statistical analysis showed that environmental management systems can sometimes produce quantifiable benefits to organisations in terms of cost reduction. However, from a contractor's view, the greatest benefit was a reduction in environmental impact outweighing financial benefits. Findings also demonstrated numerous barriers to an organisation exist, both internal and external, regarding adoption and use of environmental management systems. The most critical barrier was that cost savings do not always balance with the expense of implementation. Furthermore, waste minimisation at the design stage is viewed as most important. In general, the opinions gauged in this study indicated that short-term profits are normally considered more imperative than long-term gains. Therefore, despite a need to focus on developing strategies for removing or reducing the challenges of environmental management systems, the reality is that they may not be the panacea to sustainable development, as is often touted. © 2020 ICE Publishing.

The use of technologies will not only improve productivity in the construction of future built environments but will also enhance their operation and maintenance as they become smart cities. These latter stages in the built asset project life cycle are impacted by Construction 4.0 technologies able to both automate and optimise their operations, thus bringing benefits for facility management while also linking the built environment fabric to wider societal and governmental systems. However, there is growing concern that Construction 4.0 is directing the industry towards a 'smart dystopia', a situation with as much vulnerability as resilience, without due consideration or challenge. For example, the automation of operational processes arguably increases vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, corruptions of data or energy loss, while the constant collection of worker and citizen data by smart buildings and infrastructures raises concerns around surveillance and privacy, as well as issues of exclusion. Although Construction 4.0 has the potential to enable the industry to support the delivery, operation and maintenance of an e-topia, such ethical and social challenges should perhaps be considered before its technologies are unquestioningly embedded within built assets for use throughout the duration of their life cycles. © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","information technology; social impact; sustainability","Energy dissipation; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Office buildings; Productivity; Security of data; Built environment; Cyber-attacks; Facility management; Operation and maintenance; Operational process; Project life cycle; Social challenges; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094169458

Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses profit calculation in a public social housing organization that experienced New Public Management (NPM). Participant observations, archives and interviews inform the study over three years, enabling access to day-to-day practices. Findings: This study examines a trial of strength that revisited long-existing profitability and cost calculations. Accountants held competing views of how to treat labour costs. Some were anti-programme during a trial of incompatibility, while others were programme defenders. The authors also provide evidence of the stability of an established network and its resistance to the claims of an adversary spokesperson in a trial of strength. The concept of trial of incompatibility proved helpful in showing how the actor networks within OMEGA played out the tension between profit orientation and the social mission of offering affordable dwellings. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides rare qualitative data on the significant and complex role of calculative costing choices in determining intra-organizational profitability and its interference with the inherent social mission of the organization. Practical implications: The authors suggest that profitability calculations are influenced not only by economic context but also by different views of organizational actors regarding how to calculate profit. These calculations would benefit from a more detailed and explicit documentation of reasons for choices made, given the potential for different and, in principle, equally valid approaches. The authors provide further evidence of the complexity of the public social housing sector. Social implications: This research points to a departure from the mission of public social housing in the face of NPM reforms and further questions the compatibility of a profit orientation with the provision of affordable dwellings. Originality/value: The findings show intra-accounting variation regarding a specific element of profit calculation (labour costs) relating to the organization’s wider mission and status. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Costing; Profitability; Public sector reform; Social housing; Trials of strength",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075048334

With a special focus on oil price changes, we investigate the determinants of bank efficiency in the Middle Eastern Oil-Exporting (MEOE) countries where macro-financial conditions are substantially affected by swings in oil prices. Our analysis consists of two stages: (i) measuring the efficiency scores of banks using the Semi-Oriented Radial Measure (SORM) DEA model, (ii) investigating the impact of alternative indicators of oil prices on the estimated efficiency scores after controlling for key bank-specific and country-specific variables. The analysis is based on an un-balanced panel data of banks operating in the Middle Eastern Oil-Exporting countries over the period of 2001-2011. Our findings reveal that oil price changes affect the efficiency of banks in the MEOE countries through both direct and indirect channels. In addition, we find that Islamic banks in the region are less responsive to oil price changes than commercial and investment banks. © 2020 EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI.","Bank efficiency; Data Envelopment Analysis; Oil price changes; The Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries","Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Geographical regions; Investments; Bank specifics; DEA models; Middle East; Novel applications; Oil price changes; Oil Prices; Panel data; Crude oil price",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088274830

The findings support critics who contend that incentives crowd out other economic activity, potentially reducing long-term growth.

At the same time, systems which preserve materials over time and promote material reuse are getting increasing attention in light of calls for reducing consumption of natural resources. As new lighting technology products are designed and brought to market, consideration must be given to how products will be managed throughout the life-cycle as well as their end-of-life (EOL) fate. Lighting-as-a-service (LaaS) business models have emerged as a potential strategy for preserving the materials embedded in lighting products. In this paper, we examine the cost and environmental implications of technology management decisions in the context of the street lighting industry, employing life-cycle assessment and a Markov Decision Process model. The goal of the research is to determine a policy that minimizes expected costs and emissions for the system over a fixed time horizon thus reducing uncertainty for managers. The model used in the paper evaluates the optimal replacement strategies for street lighting products and additionally connects the result to the optimal EOL product trajectory, taking both costs and carbon emissions into account. In doing so, we are able to more deeply understand the role that LaaS business models might play in enabling closed-loop systems within the street lighting industry. © 2019",,"Closed loop systems; Commerce; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Markov processes; Street lighting; Environmental implications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lighting technology; Markov decision process models; Optimal technology; Replacement strategy; Solid state lighting; Technology managements; Costs; decision making; ecological economics; environmental management; environmental modeling; installation; life cycle; management practice; Markov chain; natural resource; optimization; resource use; strategic approach; Article; carbon footprint; cost; electricity; energy resource; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental factor; environmental policy; industry and industrial phenomena; life cycle assessment; life cycle cost assessment; renewable energy; street lighting industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080977382

However, companies compete in different industry contexts, and currently little is known about the moderating effects of these contexts on firm profitability. Improved understanding of how industry context influences the relationship between a firm's environmental practices and its financial outcomes is needed to help managers make better EMP investment decisions. Combining insights from resource-based theory and industrial organization theory, this paper formulates and empirically investigates how the effects of a firm's EMPs on its financial performance are contingent upon the joint influence of industry concentration and industry growth. Empirically rebuttable hypotheses are tested by fitting a multi-level model. We find that firms within high growth/high concentration industries that implement EMPs realize the greatest improvement in financial performance. Additionally, industry growth amplifies the effect on firm financial performance of engaging in EMPs in relatively concentrated industries, but not in less concentrated ones. The study's findings shed valuable light on the possible context-influenced role and effect of EMPs, including potential managerial and policy implications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental management; Industrial organization (I/O); Industry concentration; Industry growth; Multilevel model; Resource based view (RBV)","Investments; Managers; Profitability; Public policy; Regression analysis; Environmental management practices; Environmental practices; Financial performance; Industrial organization; Industry growth; Multilevel model; Resource-based theory; Resource-based view; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078735937

We find that software availability is associated with an increase in entry and an increase in exit by the oldest and most established firms. We suggest three potential mechanisms and, through post hoc analysis, determine which is most consistent with observed patterns. We find the effect of software availability on entry is stronger in settings with more available IT talent, more permissive labor policies, and greater demand uncertainty. Observed patterns are most consistent with software enhancing labor productivity and thus reducing exposure to uncertainty. Managerial Summary: Managers and policymakers are concerned with whether technologies like software and robotics spreading to new industries can make powerful firms even harder to unseat. For software, we find evidence consistent with the opposite: as software becomes more prevalent, entry by new firms increases and the likelihood that older firms exit increases. The patterns of entry we observe are consistent with the following mechanism. Software allows the same number of employees to serve a wider range of production levels, meaning that potential startups are less likely to be deterred by uncertain demand. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","digitization; entrepreneurship; entry; scaling; software","Analog to digital conversion; Computer software; Employment; Managers; Productivity; Demand uncertainty; entrepreneurship; entry; Established firms; Labor productivity; Potential mechanism; scaling; Software availability; Availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075279365

We develop a two-stage model for a market in which consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of a product. In our setup, consumers make purchase decisions at the first stage and update their perceptions of the product. As a result, they adjust their repurchase decisions at the second stage. Through the analysis of price discrimination effect and advertising effect, we demonstrate that consumers make their purchase decisions based on not only the discount rate but also the degree of perceived ease of use of the coupons. We then examine both single-time and double-time GB mechanisms, and recommend the optimal design for the firm to increase its profitability. Our model also accommodates uncertainty of the degree of consumers' perceived ease of use and shows that the conditions for the optimal GB mechanism are robust. © 2017 The Authors.

Through the exploration of the use of sustainable, iterative circles in a manufacturing environment, this paper explores their role in facilitating customer-focused innovation practices. Other supporting antecedences for innovative behavior are reviewed, and their combined effect upon delivering cost-effective product developments are assessed. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews in manufacturing organizations from the automotive industry. Interviews were conducted with senior functional managers to interpret the application of sustainable, iterative development circles. Analysis of the data was undertaken via thematic analysis based upon pertinent and emergent themes. Findings: Sustainable, iterative development circles overcame the inherent path-dependency of traditional linear development approaches, whereas, traditional approaches structure the involvement of key business functions, iterative circles facilitate more flexible approaches to product development that more closely met the requirements of the customer, especially when those requirements are in a state of flux. Practical implications: This iterative, customer-centric approach to product development reflects the increasingly dynamic market environments in which manufacturing organizations operate. Using this approach helps to focus the organization’s attention upon customer requirements rather than the challenges of adhering to the rigid dogma of a chosen development methodology. Originality/value: This study proposes a new approach toward the development of innovations in manufacturing organizations utilizing the sustainable, iterative circles, and therefore, contrasts with the traditional, linear development methodologies that are usually employed. © 2020, Christopher Miller, Brychan Celfyn Thomas and Michael Roeller.","Innovation; Integrative approach; Iterative circles; Management; Processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087562955

Traditional manufacturing provided the setting for much of the early research on worker productivity. However, as we have now seen an inexorable shift towards more service driven economic output, especially in the industrialized economies, the research in operations management on worker productivity has also increasingly focused on services. This monograph will take stock of the literature in operations management on worker productivity. The research is not exhaustive but is meant to showcase some of the interesting and relevant papers that fall into a few key themes. Mainly, the individual worker is the focal unit of analysis, and the goal is to explore the various operational factors that allow the worker to become more productive. Key areas of emphasis include the behavioral microfoundations of productivity, the effect of peers and workplace dynamics, the design and organization of work, and ways to improve human capital. Although much is known about the drivers of worker productivity, much remains unexplored. Furthermore, looming changes to the modern workplace call for new ways to think about worker productivity. For example, artificial intelligence, new models of business, and novel workplace arrangements, all have important implications for the design and organization of the modern workplace, and for the roles and responsibilities of the knowledge worker. Collectively, these developments will continue to make worker productivity a rich and exciting area of research. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Travel routes modelled using GIS generally use shortest network distances or Euclidean buffers to represent journeys with corresponding built-environment exposures calculated along these routes. These methods, however, are an unreliable proxy for calculating child built-environment exposures as child route choice is more complex than shortest network routes. Methods: We hypothesised that a GIS model informed by characteristics of the built-environment known to influence child route choice could be developed to more accurately model exposures. Using GPS-derived walking commutes to and from school we used logistic regression models to highlight built-environment features important in child route choice (e.g. road type, traffic light count). We then recalculated walking commute routes using a weighted network to incorporate built-environment features. Multilevel regression analyses were used to validate exposure predictions to the retail food environment along the different routing methods. Results: Children chose routes with more traffic lights and residential roads compared to the modelled shortest network routes. Compared to standard shortest network routes, the GPS-informed weighted network enabled GIS-based walking commutes to be derived with more than three times greater accuracy (38%) for the route to school and more than 12 times greater accuracy (92%) for the route home. Conclusions: This research advocates using weighted GIS networks to accurately reflect child walking journeys to school. The improved accuracy in route modelling has in turn improved estimates of children's exposures to potentially hazardous features in the environment. Further research is needed to explore if the built-environment features are important internationally. Route and corresponding exposure estimates can be scaled to the population level which will contribute to a better understanding of built-environment exposures on child health and contribute to mobility-based child health policy. © 2020 The Author(s).","Child health; Daily mobility; Environmental exposure; School commute; Walking; Weighted network","child health; commuting; diurnal activity; GIS; mobility; numerical model; regression analysis; research; urban area; article; built environment; child; child health; environmental exposure; female; human; human experiment; light; male; prediction; traffic; walking; demography; environmental exposure; environmental planning; geographic information system; school; traffic and transport; walking; Built Environment; Child; Child Health; Environment Design; Environmental Exposure; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Residence Characteristics; Schools; Transportation; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083481690

Using a qualitative approach, we interviewed 29 couples, both together and apart, about work-family decision-making, including common routines (work hours, childcare/school drop-offs, and pickups) and daily decisions (dealing with sick kids and unexpected work). We analysed over 200 decisions using thematic and critical incident analysis, and came to understand the stories in our data from the lens of decision logics. We observed that different types of couples made different choices because they had different rules for appropriate behaviour guiding their decisions. This way of making decisions is consistent with the logic of appropriateness model of decision-making, in which decisions are made by following rules that are derived from identity construals. We observed that couples’ rules emanated from their joint family identity construals, rather than their individual construals. This is a novel finding that drives theory on decision-making forward by showing how this decision logic can apply when couples are the decision-making unit. Practically, our results can be applied to broaden employers’ awareness of how work and family responsibilities can be met by different employees and to increase couples’ knowledge of alternative approaches. Practitioner points: Employees who are part of dual-income couples make work-family decisions based on their family identities, but there are numerous ways to construe family identities and employers should not assume that all men see their family roles as providers, nor do all women see their family roles as caregivers. Employers should welcome employees’ suggestions about how they can best complete their work and should recognize that employees can be creative when it comes to managing work and family demands. Employers should promote a more open environment in which employees and managers can discuss their work and family situations, and how they approach meeting family demands. Interventions could be designed to help dual-income couples increase their own understanding of their family identities and their awareness of different ways to be a dual-income couple. © 2019 The British Psychological Society","decision-making; dual-earner couples; identity construals; logic of appropriateness; work-family interface","article; awareness; caregiver; child; child care; decision making; employee; employer; female; human; identity; joint; logic; male; manager; physician; responsibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070097801

This study examines the question: how do networked organisations build capacity for anticipatory governance through project-based interactions? We analyse a global network of organisations that mobilise climate and hydrological modelling technologies into the Chao Phraya and Ayeyarwaddy deltas. The methodology innovatively combines ethnographic data with policy analysis and social network analysis. Findings suggest that organisations consolidate technology and knowledge transfer through a global network. However, their governance effect in enhancing anticipatory decision making is found to be marginal at the local level. We argue that anticipatory governance practices need a balancing of foresight tools and techniques with local institutional arrangements in order to be effective. We further demonstrate that technology transfer projects need to be backed up with social and strategic capacity building in order to nurture consistent anticipatory governance in different cultural contexts. We conclude that preventive actions, together with transparent operational response frameworks, could significantly improve resilience and adaptability of local knowledge systems and institutions dealing with climate change adaptation. Such integration could enable anticipatory response measures to better manage risk, as well as increase institutional cooperation for long term environmental planning. © 2020 The Authors","Anticipatory governance; Capacity building; Environmental planning; Global networks; Modelling technologies; Project-based interactions","capacity building; climate modeling; decision making; environmental planning; ethnography; future prospect; governance approach; hydrological modeling; policy analysis; project management; social network; technology transfer; Ayeyarwady; Central Region [Thailand]; Chao Phraya Delta; Irrawaddy Delta; Myanmar; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077744745

The collaborative project network information transfer (CPNIT) model was established based on the theories of information theory, agent-based modeling, and social network analysis. The key part of the model is the rules system, which includes four sets: the rules of information dissemination, information absorption, efficiency and effectiveness evaluation, and network structure adjustment strategies. A case study was conducted, including parallel simulation experiments with three scenarios of adjustment strategies. The results showed that the model can accurately present the dynamic processes of information transfer in CPNs, and the structure adjustments were demonstrated to have great effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of information transfer.

Patient preferences are important in determining whether diagnostic tests are successful in practice, but there are few data describing the test attributes which matter most to patients. We elicited patients’ preferences for attributes of diagnostic tests that could be used to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in primary care across seven European countries. Methods: We used an online stated preference survey, including a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE explored how patients make trade-offs between three key attributes of diagnostic tests: the speed that results were available, confidence in the test results, and how convenient it is to take the test. Individuals were eligible to complete the survey if they had taken antibiotics within the last 2 years and were resident in Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Greece, the Netherlands or the United Kingdom (UK). Results: In total, 988 respondents completed the survey. The DCE responses illustrated that speed was the least important attribute in most countries. Responses from Germany and the Netherlands indicated that confidence was most important in these countries. Responses from the UK, France, Spain and Italy showed convenience as the most important attribute in these countries. Two attributes, confidence and convenience, were jointly favoured by respondents in Greece. Conclusion: Patients in different European countries do not have the same preferences for the attributes of diagnostic tests to manage AMR in primary care. Failure to account for such differences during test development could reduce test uptake, result in continued overuse of antibiotics, and hamper marketisation. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; adult; aged; antibiotic resistance; Article; controlled study; diagnostic test; female; France; Germany; Greece; health survey; household income; human; Italy; major clinical study; male; Netherlands; patient preference; practice guideline; primary health care; primary medical care; Spain; United Kingdom; upper respiratory tract infection; decision making; Europe; middle aged; patient preference; psychology; unnecessary procedure; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Decision Making; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Preference; Unnecessary Procedures; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073930568

This degradation is compounded when coupled with the growing backlog of needs and limited resources, making prioritization of these activities a complex problem. Current decision-making techniques utilized to solve this complex problem lack a holistic approach, objectivity, and topological aspect. To address these shortcomings, this research proposes a new comprehensive decision-making framework for maintenance and modernization of aging transportation infrastructure. The framework first employs a systems thinking approach to identify impact factors, then conducts a complex network analysis to assess the location criticality of each component within the system, and finally applies an innovative Bayesian network structure learning method to eliminate subjective judgment and reduce the drawbacks of currently available learning algorithms when using real-world data. The robustness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via a case study for inland waterways. Analysis of the results confirm the prioritization determined by utilizing the proposed framework optimizes system availability.

Besides these we incorporate bank size, equity, market share, government ownership, and growth of Gross Domestic Product per capita, employing an Ordinary Least Squares method. Focus is on two alternative measures of banking market efficiency: net interest margin and overhead costs (operating expenses to assets). Elevated levels of these two ratios should indicate a low level of banking efficiency. The evidence suggests that the link between capital regulation and banking efficiency is not robust enough to control for other regulatory variables. Results confirm that activity restrictions have a negative and significant impact on banking efficiency. Policies encouraging official supervisory power do not enhance efficiency of the banking sector. The only approach positively and statistically significantly associated with efficiency is private monitoring.

We examine the effects of loyalty app adoption on customers' offline purchase patterns, reward redemption, and deal-prone behaviors as well as store-level competition in a multivendor loyalty program (MVLP) context, where multiple offline brands collaborate in the operation of point-sharing initiatives. Mobile-driven loyalty apps substantially lower consumer search costs, thereby enhancing on-demand information accessibility and facilitating the monitoring of reward points. Based on a unique data set that comprises information on customers' loyalty app adoption status, loyalty point redemption patterns, and purchase behaviors in MVLP environments, we investigate how the transition from plastic-based programs to loyalty apps influences the out-of-pocket spending and point redemption patterns of consumers. Our findings reveal that the adoption of loyalty apps is associated with an increase in purchases and the predilection for point redemption. Despite these positive outcomes, however, potential adverse consequences may arise in the form of deal-susceptible behaviors and reduced store-specific loyalty. Loyalty app adopters tend to be more vulnerable to deals, with these customers selectively buying highly discounted products of low margin. Additionally, loyalty app consumers visit more stores but spend less in a focal store, thereby diminishing loyalty to this specific store. These results have managerial implications on optimal mobile-based loyalty program designs and implementation, reward-driven platform strategies, and risk management initiatives in an MVLP setting. © 2020 INFORMS.","Deal-susceptible behaviors; Difference-in-differences; Econometrics; Loyalty programs; Mere exposure; Mobile apps; Mobile channel; Mobile customer relationship management (mCRM); Propensity score matching; Spillover effects; Technology adoption","Consumer behavior; Economics; Risk management; Sales; Economic values; Managerial implications; Multi-vendor; On-demand informations; Plastic cards; Platform strategy; Program design; Search costs; Application programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092922488

The authors estimate two simultaneous equations: a growth equation and equalization equation and find that expenditure decentralization has a negative and statistically significant effect at conventional levels on short-run economic growth for both China and India. However, the authors also find that this result is sensitive to the set of included explanatory variables. This leads the authors to conclude that expenditure decentralization has no effect on short-run economic growth for either country. The authors also find that expenditure decentralization has a positive and statistically significant effect on fiscal equalization for both countries but find no evidence that fiscal equalization affects short-run economic growth for either China or India. In contrast, the authors find that expenditure decentralization has a positive effect on long-run economic growth in the case of India, but not in the case of China. Finally, the authors report evidence that fiscal equalization has no effect on long-run economic growth in the case of China; however, the authors find that equalization has a positive and statistically significant at conventional levels effect on long-run economic growth in India. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate two-step GMM simultaneous equations models, using panel data for China and India for the period 1985 to 2005. To examine the effect of fiscal decentralization (FD) policies on economic growth in China and India, the authors estimate two equations: a growth equation and an equalization equation. For the growth equation, the authors adopt a production-function-based model that is widely used in the empirical literature on growth; however, the authors do make some compromises with this specification due to the unavailability of certain data. For the equalization equation, the authors include variables that economic theory and empirical evidence suggest influence fiscal disparities among subnational governments which in turn influence the demand for horizontal fiscal equalization (HFE). To the extent possible, the authors employ the same econometric specification, variable constructions and sample periods for both China and India. The authors believe this strategy provides a more rigorous test of the FD hypothesis. Findings: The authors find that expenditure decentralization has a negative and statistically significant effect at conventional levels on short-run economic growth for both China and India. However, the authors also find that this result is sensitive to the set of included explanatory variables. This leads to conclude that expenditure decentralization has no effect on short-run economic growth for either country. The authors also find that expenditure decentralization has a positive and statistically significant effect on fiscal equalization for both countries but find no evidence that fiscal equalization affects short-run economic growth for either China or India. In contrast, the authors find that expenditure decentralization has a positive effect on long-run economic growth in the case of India, but not in the case of China. Finally, the authors report evidence that fiscal equalization has no effect on long-run economic growth in the case of China; however, the authors find that equalization has a positive and statistically significant at conventional levels effect on long-run economic growth in India. Research limitations/implications: Due to the importance of FD policies, especially to many developing countries that are currently pursuing decentralization reforms, future research should examine the effect of FD on economic growth for other countries. Furthermore, although it would be difficult to do so, future research should examine whether FD promotes political stability on ethnically diverse countries. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no one has examined the effect of FD policies on India's growth experience. What is more is that this is also the first of its kind to have a comprehensive empirical investigation into these two major developing countries with very interesting similarities and differences in FD policies. It is thus of great importance to examine the effect of expenditure decentralization and HFE on economic growth in China and India. © 2020, Yinghua Jin and Mark Rider.","Economic growth; Fiscal decentralization; Horizontal fiscal equalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089982770

Businesses throughout the world are highly motivated to invest in mobile commerce infrastructure and deploy their mobile commerce strategies as a source of sustainable competitive advantage to maintain existing and attract new customers. As probably the first systematic and comprehensive effort to date, this study analyzes the factors affecting customers' intention to use mobile commerce in Vietnam. The results show that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, variety of services, and trialability have both direct and indirect positive (via perceived usefulness) impacts on intention to use mobile commerce, while trust and social influence have indirect positive impacts on intention to use mobile commerce in Vietnam. Cost does not have any impact on intention to use mobile commerce in Vietnam. The results of this study are also compared with that of studies on mobile commerce conducted in China and Malaixia by Chong et al.

Although most consumers are already familiar with options such as home delivery or pick-up locations, situational factors determine their choice among the different alternatives; no study has, however, addressed this topic before. To fill this gap, this study identifies 15 different situational factors to examine their influence on the selection of delivery and return options and the effect of consumers’ demographic characteristics. The empirical analysis is based on an online questionnaire distributed to 650 respondents (266 valid responses). In addition, this study uses MANOVA and ANOVA to determine the relationship between each situational factor and consumer characteristics. The results show that 13 situational factors have a significant impact on consumer decisions, and among them time pressure, the distance to the store and channel spill-over are the most influential factors. The results also show that situational factors significantly rely on individual characteristics. For instance, getting help from an employee is significantly more important for consumers who are under 25 years of age. The study reveals some valuable implications for retailers. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Additionally, human capital herein includes social factors such as social capital, which research has demonstrated can be developed from intellectual capital, and vice versa. Findings from an experiment with 40 professional investors (resulting in 160 independent observations) suggested that belonging to a company's collaborative networks—where they would gain access to IA performance information—led them to adjust their investment risk assessments downward or upward in response to material weakness or strength disclosures pertaining to IA performance. Additionally, a laboratory experiment revealed that 121 novice investors who learned how to interpret and use their social networks to gain access to IA performance information also led them to adjust their investment risk assessments in response to material IA information deficiencies in target companies.

We embrace market microstructure analysis and the event study method to understand how various manipulation techniques impact on market measures, and the Error Correction Model to evaluate their economic effects. Manipulation is found to distort market efficiency measures (such as market capitalization, value traded ratio and All-Share Index) and genuine traders are forced to exit the market to avoid possible trading with a manipulator. Such huge divestment and the subsequent financial risk weaken the ability of the Stock Exchange market to improve economic performance, creating negative consequences at the post-manipulation period. Essentially, economic variables (such as the GDP) react negatively to manipulative trading. This finding is insightful and a prompt to the Securities and Exchange Commission to design policy responses towards deterring and prosecuting unfair trading practices or other activities that contravene the market rules. © 2020, The Author(s).","Economic growth; Event study; Market efficiency measures; Market indicators; Market manipulation; Market microstructure; Nigerian Stock Exchange",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089965652

Study 1 examines contingency theory regarding managerial CSFs using survey responses (N = 211) of project management professionals from the United Kingdom. Using survey data from projects (N = 336) in the United Kingdom, Study 2 examines the contextual dependence of managerial CSFs in a moderated-moderation, theoretical framework whereby project technological uncertainty moderates the relationship between managerial CSFs and project execution and efficiency, and in-group collectivism culture of the executing organisation moderates the effect of technological uncertainty. Results confirm that external and internal contexts influence managerial CSFs. Managerial CSFs have a greater than expected influence on project execution and efficiency. The positive effect of managerial CSFs is weaker when technological uncertainty is high. When technological uncertainty is high, the effect of managerial CSFs strengthens as levels of in-group collectivism culture increase. However, when technological uncertainty is low, the effect of managerial CSFs weakens as levels of in-group collectivism culture increase.

Our mechanisms generalize the commonly used deferred acceptance (DA) school choice mechanism to a two-round setting and retain its desirable incentive and efficiency properties. School choice systems typically run DA with a lottery number assigned to each student to break ties in school priorities. We show that under natural conditions on demand, the second-round tiebreaking lottery can be correlated arbitrarily with that of the first round without affecting allocative welfare and that reversing the lottery order between rounds minimizes reassignment among all PLDA mechanisms. Empirical investigations based on data from New York City high school admissions support our theoretical findings.

Beyond the typical money demand specification, which includes income and interest rates, Mundell (Can J Econ Polit Sci 29:475–485, 1963) made a case for the exchange rate as an important determinant of money demand working through currency substitution. This paper contributes a new approach to test the short- and long-run effects of currency fluctuations on money demand in Albania, a small open economy without deep financial markets. More specifically, we examine the case for asymmetric effects of exchange rate fluctuations on money demand by using a nonlinear adjustment mechanism within an ARDL model. Using data for 1996–2016 from Albania, we show that the money demand is stable in both the linear and nonlinear specifications. The nonlinear model reveals an asymmetric effect of exchange rates on money demand, with depreciations reducing money demand, likely due to a substitution effect amplified by a relatively dollarized economy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asymmetric effects; Currency substitution; Exchange rate; Money demand; Nonlinear ARDL","capital flow; currency; demand analysis; econometrics; exchange rate; nonlinearity; numerical model; Albania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077275634

It is commonly assumed that the DMUs are independent of one another, in that each has its own quantities of a set of inputs and outputs. In case this assumption of independence of DMUs holds, decreasing the inputs of one DMU will not affect the inputs of others. The current paper moves beyond the conventional framework and examines a problem setting where there is an interdependence among the DMUs. Consider the case where the members of a given subgroup of DMUs have an input in common, such as would be the case if a set of highway maintenance crews in a district are under the jurisdiction of a district supervisor and district-level resources. The efficiency measurement difficulty created by this “shared’ resource phenomenon is that in attempting to move an inefficient crew towards the frontier by reducing that shared resource (hence penalising that crew), the other crews in that same district will be equally penalised. Specifically, decreasing district resources in relation to their impact on a maintenance crew will cause that resource to decrease as well for other members of the same group. The conventional (input-oriented) DEA model that does not cater for such interdependence situations will fail to address this important issue. To capture this interdependence, we develop a new DEA-like methodology. One of the properties of this new methodology is that its production possibility set cannot be defined in the same manner as in the conventional DEA setting. This is due to the fact that when the DMU under evaluation is projected towards the frontier, the input/output structures of the other units in the same group are altered, unlike the conventional situation where the structures of the other DMUs remain fixed. We apply this new methodology to the problem of evaluating a set of departments in a university setting, where the departments are grouped under various faculties. © Operational Research Society 2019.","academic departments; cooperation; DEA; DMU dependence; shared inputs","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Academic department; cooperation; Decision making unit; DMU dependence; Efficiency measurement; Production possibility set; Relative efficiency; shared inputs; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071296363

The utilisation of BIM has widened in scope, functionality, flexibility and interoperability to support the AM business process. However, research concerning BIM business value in AM has been inadequate despite its considerable potential and significance in the attainment of organisational objectives. The realisation of BIM business value requires a concerted effort by the asset owner to be able to determine and appraise the critical activities that drive business value in AM. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative research approach based on a multi-case study strategy that aimed to identify the key business processes that drive BIM business value in AM. The study involved a three-stage research design using interviews and document analysis to facilitate a cross-case analysis from the perspective of the activity systems and dimensions of BIM governance. Findings: The paper identified six critical activity systems that drive BIM business value for an asset owner: BIM strategy, contract management, lifecycle management, maintenance management, work-order management and value realisation management. The study found that the most developed activity system is the BIM strategy, and the least is value realisation management across all cases. Also, the paper points out that the most proficient BIM governance dimension is process, and the least is people across the three cases. The study noted that the ability of an asset owner to realise BIM business value has maturity undertones and that the asset owner could derive BIM business value, if the six activity systems are effectively executed and continuously improved to an advanced stage of maturity. Originality/value: An original contribution of the study is the development of the understanding of asset owners in relation to the discovery of key activity systems that drive BIM business value in AM. Another significant contribution of this paper is the demonstration of a novel approach to evaluate organisational maturity of asset owners from the perspectives of the activity systems and BIM governance dimensions of people, process and technology. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asset management; Building information modelling; Management; Maturity; Value realisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090018636

One prominent example is retail distribution, where familiarity with the delivery location can save the driver time. In contrast to other kinds of familiarity (e.g., tasks, customer needs) that continually increase with a larger number of repetitions, location familiarity is primarily established with a driver's first visit. Thus, familiarity results from operational routing decisions. However, as we show in this paper, there is potential value in considering the tactical value of familiarity and its development over a longer horizon. To this end, we develop and solve a tactical model to specify the long-term implications of improved driver-customer familiarity, introducing a solution methodology for the stochastic and dynamic multi-period routing problem with driver-customer familiarity. Our methodology utilizes a policy that explicitly invests in the familiarity between selected driver-customer pairs, encouraging the development of pairs that are tactically beneficial. We determine the appropriate investment dimensions for each pair, considering which locations a driver has visited and how many drivers have visited a location. We show that under the problem conditions tested this investment policy leads to a reduction in cost compared to a short term, myopic policy, while increasing the overall level of familiarity between drivers and customers and hedging against driver or customer turnover. We also find that focusing only on routing or on exploiting existing familiarity leads to substantial increases in cost. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cost function approximation; Dynamism; Familiarity; Routing; Stochasticity","Investments; Location; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Appropriate investment; Investment policies; Number of services; Retail distribution; Routing decisions; Routing problems; Service provider; Solution methodology; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085735744

In this article, we call for operations management (OM) to broaden its perspective by strengthening linkages with other functions of the business, thereby to realize competitive advantages and strategic integration, as well as to avoid resource misallocation. The issues involved are presented and tested by examining the effects of intermeshing sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenditures with customer-centred flow manufacturing, the latter being measured by system inventory as surrogate for customer lead time. In doing so, we designate trends in total inventory as the independent variable—representative of a dominant target of flow/lean management—and trends in SG&A expenditures as the output variable. The research tasks are enabled by inventory and SG&A data being widely available in companies’ audited financial statements. Such hard data offers methodological and validation advantages over, say, opinion-based survey research. The research adds bulk to existing flow/lean management theory and can be helpful in inducing primary business functions (e.g. OM, finance, sales and marketing) and sub-functions (such as SG&A and management accounting) to engage in cross-functional efforts in the cause of flow-oriented process improvement and company competitiveness. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","competitive strategy; Flow/lean management; inventory trends; resource allocation; SG&A expenditures","Competition; Resource allocation; Administrative functions; Competitive advantage; Competitive strategy; Independent variables; inventory trends; Management accounting; Operations management; Strategic integration; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076410112

I build on prior work in Strategy by: (a) bringing together two distinct measures of persistence of performance and explaining how they complement each other and help distinguish theories, (b) extending the time series from those prior studies and applying modern statistical improvements to demonstrate new patterns. Specifically, while I find ordinal persistence increased monotonically since the 1980s, autocorrelation of performance was not monotonic and is now approaching lows from the mid-1990s. These patterns are inconsistent with mechanisms raised in the debate about declining competition. I suggest that these facts can inspire Strategy theory, which would contribute to that debate. Managerial Summary: A central concern of managers is how precarious is their position, or for new ventures, whether they will be able to displace current leading firms. Even within the same year, management writing and the media might claim that it is both: a) a time of faster-than-ever turnover, b) or that large firms have become unassailable. This manuscript tracks two measures of performance persistence over time. I find that persistence of rank has increased roughly steadily since the 1980s. How associated are performance measures year-to-year was actually at its peak in the mid 1980s, potentially explaining the debate. The final patterns are consistent with top firms separating from followers in performance so much that increasing volatility in their performance does not lead to changes in rank. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","competition; persistence of performance; rank; strategy; trends","Management; Planning; Measures of performance; New ventures; Performance measure; Research traditions; Theory development; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087215559

The overall impact of information sharing on firms' cybersecurity investment decision has only been game-theoretically explored, not giving practical implication. The authors therefore leverage the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA) to observe firms' attitudinal changes toward investing in cybersecurity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors design a quasi-experiment where they set US cybersecurity firms as an experimental group (a proxy for total investment in cybersecurity) and nonsecurity firms as a control group to measure the net effect of CISA on overall cybersecurity investment. To enhance the robustness of the authors’ difference-in-difference estimation, the authors employed propensity score matched sample test and reduced sample test as well. Findings: For the full sample, the authors’ empirical findings suggest that US security firms' overall performance (i.e. Tobin's Q) improved following the legislation, which indicates that more investment in cybersecurity was followed by the formation of information sharing environment. Interestingly, big cybersecurity firms are beneficiaries of the CISA when the full samples are divided into small and large group. Both Tobin's Q and sales growth rate increased for big firms after CISA. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ findings shed more light on the research stream of cybersecurity and information sharing, a research area only explored by game-theoretical approaches. Given that the US government has tried to enforce cybersecurity defensive measures by building cooperative architecture such as CISA 2015, the policy implication of this study is far-reaching. Originality/value: The authors’ study contributes to the research on the economic benefits of sharing cybersecurity information by finding the missing link (i.e. empirical evidence) between “sharing” and “economic impact.” This paper confirms that CISA affects the cybersecurity industry unevenly by firm size, a previously unidentified relationship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cybersecurity industry; Cybersecurity information sharing; Difference-in-difference; Economic impact; Quasi-experiment; Real option theory","Economic and social effects; Game theory; Growth rate; Industrial economics; Information analysis; Investments; Public policy; Sales; Security of data; Cooperative architectures; Design/methodology/approach; Difference-in-differences; Experimental groups; Government organizations; Investment decisions; Policy implications; Theoretical approach; Information dissemination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089398915

A commonly reported reason for merging is to increase access to capital. However, no empirical evidence exists to show whether capital expenditures increased at rural hospitals after a merger. We used a difference-in-differences approach to determine whether total capital expenditures changed at rural hospitals after a merger. The comparison group (rural hospitals that did not merge during the 2012 through 2015 study period) was weighted using inverse probability of treatment weights. The key outcome measure was logged total capital expenditures.Merging resulted in a 26% increase in capital expenditures and also was associated with a significant improvement in plant age. The postmerger improvement in plant age may have been partially attributable to merger-related accounting changes and partially attributable to increased capital expenses, possibly on long-term asset renovations and replacement.These findings suggest that through mergers, rural hospital board members and executives who have accepted or are considering a merger may improve a hospital's ability to increase capital expenditures. Further, increased capital investments in rural hospitals may be an important signal to the community that the acquirer intends to keep the rural hospital open and continue providing some volume and level of services within the community. Future research should determine how capital is spent after a merger. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, previous research in construction has not comprehensively investigated the relationship between personality and crew productivity. This paper uses personality profiles to investigate a new fundamental concept, the relationship between compatibility of personality and crew productivity at the task level. Twenty-eight masons completed a revised questionnaire of the Big Five to indicate their personality. Personality scores were used to calculate compatibility in each of the 20 participating two-mason crews working on eight projects. Regression analysis was performed to establish the relationship between compatibility and crew productivity. Results show that that there is a high positive correlation between compatibility and crew productivity. Compatibility accounts for more than half of the predictable variance in productivity. This paper makes four major contributions: it proposes a new metric to measure compatibility of personality among workers in a crew; it reveals how personality factors affect productivity; it provides rigorous methods to analyze correlations (using confidence intervals and Bayesian inference) for construction experiments; and it provides theoretical contributions to advancing the theory of personality and productivity in construction projects. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Compatibility; Correlation analysis; Crew management; Personality; Productivity","Bayesian networks; Inference engines; Regression analysis; Bayesian inference; Confidence interval; Construction crews; Construction process; Construction projects; Exploratory studies; Fundamental concepts; Positive correlations; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086799385

At the same time, the suburbanization of poverty and immigration are making the region increasingly – albeit unevenly - diverse. This paper synthesizes insights from planning and ecology to address the following questions: how do burned areas differ from the rest of the region in terms of poverty, race, and housing values; how has this changed since 1980; and what are the implications for environmental justice? Typically, low-income urban communities of color are disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts. However, this study finds that the wildland-adjacent neighborhoods most impacted by wildfire have remained predominantly white and affluent, even as Southern California has become increasingly diverse. Moreover, housing in burned areas is increasingly more expensive. These results indicate that home ownership in a fire-prone, wildland-adjacent neighborhood is a profitable investment for those who can afford it. This situation is likely creating perverse incentives for continued development of the wildland-urban interface, leading to both continued ecological disturbance and affluent residents continuing to subject themselves to more physical danger than they have acknowledged. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Environmental justice; Housing; Suburbanization of poverty; Wildfire; Wildland-urban interface","climate effect; environmental justice; fire history; hazard assessment; homeownership; housing conditions; housing market; neighborhood; poverty; profitability; race; suburban area; suburbanization; vulnerability; wildfire; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084567358

In contrast to previous approaches, the technique allows comparisons between portfolios of rates while capturing complexities emerging in modern electricity sectors. Welfare analyses conducted with the method can account for interactions between intermittent renewable generation, distributed energy resources and tariff structures. We explore the theoretical and practical implications of the model that underlies the technique. Our analysis shows that a regulator may induce the welfare maximizing configuration of the demand by properly updating portfolios of tariffs. We exploit the structure of the model to construct a simple algorithm to find globally optimal solutions of the associated nonlinear optimization problem; a computational experiment suggests that the specialized procedure can outperform standard nonlinear programming techniques. To illustrate the practical relevance of the rate analysis method, we compare portfolios of tariffs with data from two electricity systems. Although portfolios with sophisticated rates create value in both, these improvements differ enough to advise different portfolios. This conclusion is beyond the reach of previous techniques to analyze rates, illustrating the importance of using model-based data-driven approaches in the design of rates in modern electricity sectors. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy systems modeling; Mathematical programming; Rate design","Energy resources; Mathematical programming; Nonlinear programming; Computational experiment; Data-driven approach; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity sector; Energy systems modeling; Non-linear optimization problems; Programming technique; Renewable generation; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065166025

Since OOS significantly weakens project performance, this paper pinpoints the factors that should be addressed to help mitigate it. Using an extensive project-based survey, 42 projects were statistically investigated. Projects with inadequate coordination among different parties were shown to suffer from significant OOS. Lack of owner participation and engineering support during construction were main causes of OOS, whereas implementing constructability and alignment processes helped mitigate it. Additionally, more collaborative project delivery systems better mitigated OOS compared to less collaborative ones. Change orders were highly associated with OOS. However, project complexity was not correlated with OOS, highlighting that all projects are prone to OOS regardless of complexity. Front-end planning, planning for start-up, three-dimensional modeling, and frequently updating project schedules helped mitigate OOS. In contrast, the excessive use of request-for-information forms and their prolonged processing time, unplanned overtime, trade stacking, and absenteeism were all directly associated with OOS. Professionals are advised to use the findings presented in this paper to help mitigate OOS, thus significantly improving project performance. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Management; Collaborative projects; Comprehensive analysis; Engineering support; Front-end planning; Project complexity; Project performance; Request for informations; Three-dimensional model; Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083654849

A VMI partnership provides the supplier an opportunity to manage inventory for the supply chain in exchange for point-of-sales (POS)- and inventory-level information from the retailer. However, retailers typically possess superior local market information and as has been the case in recent years, are able to capture and analyze customer purchasing behavior beyond the traditional POS data. Such analyses provide the retailer access to market signals that are otherwise hard to capture using POS information. We show and quantify the implication of the financial obligations of each party in VMI that renders communication of such important market signals as noncredible. To help institute a sound VMI collaboration, we propose learn and screen-a dynamic inventory mechanism-for the supplier to effectively manage inventory and information in the supply chain. The proposed mechanism combines the ability of the supplier to learn about market conditions from POS data (over multiple selling periods) and dynamically determine when to screen the retailer and acquire his private demand information. Inventory decisions in the proposed mechanism serve a strategic purpose in addition to their classic role of satisfying customer demand. We show that our proposed dynamic mechanism significantly improves the supplier's expected profit and increases the efficiency of the overall supply chain operations under a VMI agreement.

Specifically, we test whether the rs1044396 polymorphism—one variation in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 4 (CHRNA4) gene—is a reliable predictor of propensity to search for information. A sample of 205 subjects performed an information search task and then donated genetic material, which was analyzed. Using these data we found that the rs1044396 polymorphism is associated with both search duration and the amount of information searched, contributing a genetic explanation for a portion of propensity to search for information. People with the C:C version of rs1044396 gathered 25% more information but spent 13% less time on each piece of information than people with T-alleles before making a decision. Thus, the amount of information that people gather and the temporal cost of gathering that information have a strong genetic component, which has implications for internet search strategies, information use, and information systems design. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

Studying the spatial-temporal change pattern of land use in this region is helpful to optimize the land use pattern, improve and protect the ecological environment quality, and is of great significance to ensure the coordinated development of population, resources and environment. Based on TM satellite remote sensing and four years (1980, 1995, 2000 and 2010) image data, the land use/cover information in the trans-provincial marginal zone of China is extracted. The spatial-temporal characteristics of land use/cover change in the study area in the past 30 years are revealed using land-use temporal-spatial change index, dynamics of land-use change, comprehensive index of land-use level, change in land-use degree, rate of change in land-use and GIS spatial analysis techniques. The future 30 years development trend is predicted by Markov model method. (1) The land use in the interior provincial fringe area of China is mainly trans-provincial marginal zone. Here are dominated by forestland, grassland, and unused land. The most obvious changes are an increase in land for an increase construction land and a reduction of unused land, and there are differences in different regions. Forestland is the main land type in Northeast China. Forestland, cultivated land and grassland are important land types in southeastern China. However, grassland type is seen as unused land and woodland in Qinghai-Tibet area. Unutilized land is the main land type in Northwest China, showing a situation of increasing first and then decreasing. (2) Influenced by environmental conditions and social factors such as population growth, economic development and regional development policies, the land use types in 1980–1995 and 1995–2010 show obvious spatial differentiation characteristics in different zones. (3)From 1980 to 2010, the land use types in the study area have undergone complex transformation. The reduced area of cultivated land, woodland, grassland and water area is larger than the newly increased area, while the reduced area of construction land and unused land is smaller than the newly increased area. (4) By 2030, the increase of construction land area will have a positive effect on the economic and social development of the region. The increase of forestland area will further improve the ecological environment here. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Lulc; Markov model; Sustainable development; Trans-provincial marginal areas","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Markov processes; Population statistics; Regional planning; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Economic and social development; Environmental conditions; Lulc; Markov model; Satellite remote sensing; Spatial-temporal changes; Spatial-temporal characteristics; Trans-provincial marginal areas; Land use; water; administrative framework; environmental quality; land use change; Markov chain; regional economy; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; aquatic biology; Article; China; controlled study; ecosystem; environmental policy; forest; grassland; land use; Markov chain; nonhuman; sustainable development; tillage; trans provincial marginal area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080918187

Using data from 880 questionnaires to seafarers and 60 interviews conducted with seafarers and managers, from two Chinese and two European shipping companies, this study takes a first step to addressing this gap. It reveals perceptions of higher fatigue, and poorer working and employment conditions, among seafarers working for Chinese as compared with European shipping companies. This difference was related to a relative lack of commitment from the Chinese shipping companies' managers to fatigue mitigation and a participatory approach. Overall, the findings suggest that although the merchant shipping industry has internationally regulated working and on-board living conditions, management practices and compliance standards within companies in different countries vary. International regulatory arrangements, therefore, do not result in a level playing field – which has potentially serious consequences both for seafarers' safety, health and wellbeing, and for the safety of the world's fleets and marine environments. The findings also indicate that, despite differences in degree, fatigue continues to be a significant problem across the shipping industry. Finally, ways are suggested in which stakeholders could contribute to improving fatigue mitigation and management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","International comparison; Maritime regulations; Participation; Seafarers' fatigue; Working conditions","comparative study; compliance; employment; management; participatory approach; perception; regulatory framework; shipping; stakeholder; working conditions; China; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080093079

The setting for the study is a set of acute care hospitals, where we examine the care process and discharge decisions for individual patients. Determining a patient's suitability for discharge is cognitively taxing, calling for the decision maker to draw on up-to-date clinical expertise and detailed information. We postulate that bounded rationality in decision making can lead the care provider to substitute clinical readiness for discharge, a more cognitively complex attribute, with the observed days spent in the hospital, a more easily accessible heuristic. Identifying the use of the heuristic is challenging, as patient readiness for discharge is often correlated with the time spent in the hospital. Our identification strategy, motivated by regression discontinuity design, exploits a discontinuity associated with the admission process at midnight. On the basis of more than 177,000 patient discharges spanning eight years, we find support for the use of the heuristic: 19.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) [14.6%, 23.8%]) of patients incur an increased length of stay by a day on average as a result of the heuristic. We also find that the reliance on the heuristic is associated with overtreatment; postmidnight patients on average cost $512 (95% CI [$100, $923]) more but without any corresponding improvement in healthcare outcomes. A counterfactual analysis shows that eliminating the heuristic lowers the bed capacity needed to maintain the same patient throughput. For example, for a hospital unit in our study with a bed capacity of 106, eliminating the heuristic would allow the hospital to maintain the same throughput with 1.61 fewer beds on average. These findings have a number of implications for policy formulation and managerial decision making. © 2019 INFORMS","Attribute substitution; Heuristics; Hospitals; Operational performance","Behavioral research; Hospitals; Bounded rationality; Confidence interval; Decision makers; Identification strategies; Managerial decision making; Natural experiment; Patient discharge; Policy formulation; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078729664

Complexity theory tenets include recognizing that the causal conditions resulting in high PMP have different conditions (i.e., ingredients) typically than the causal conditions resulting in low PMP—adopting this perspective supports the usefulness of asymmetric point or interval estimation rather than the currently pervasive symmetric approach to theory construction and empirical modeling of variable directional relationships (VDR). This study constructs a general model and specific configurational propositions that include social capital, processes, and knowledge management effectiveness as causal conditions indicating case outcomes of high and separately low PMP. Using survey data, the study includes examining propositions and models empirically on the causal conditions for completed projects (n = 302, USA sample of executives in product and service industrial firms). The findings support the perspective that high (as well as low) PMP depends on resource orchestration (configurational) antecedent conditions. The findings serve to support the general proposition that applications of complexity theory in project management research respond effectively in building in the requisite variety for deep understanding and accurate forecasting of performance outcomes. This study includes contributions to theory and empirical research that support the perspective that separate sets of resource orchestrations of alternative complex antecedents (rather than a VDR, symmetric, net effects perspective) forecast high (low) project management performances accurately. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Algorithms; Configurations; Knowledge management effectiveness; Performance; Project management; Social capital","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Configurations; Management effectiveness; Performance; Performance outcome; Product and services; Project management research; Social capitals; Theory construction; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076240609

These products are perishable and substitutable by nature and create complexities for managing inventory. Instead of a financial measure, numerous measures should be considered and balanced to meet business objectives and enhance inventory management. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a multi-methodological approach and develops a framework that integrates discrete event simulation (DES), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques to define the most favourable replenishment policy using non-financial measures. Findings: The integration framework performs well as illustrated in the numerical example; outcomes from the framework are comparable to those generated using a traditional, financial measures-based, approach. This research demonstrates that it is feasible to adopt non-financial performance measures to define a replenishment policy and evaluate performance. Originality/value: The framework, thus, prioritises non-financial measures and addresses issues of lacking information sharing and employee involvement to enhance hospitals' performance while minimising costs. The non-financial measures improve cross-functional communication while supporting simpler transformations from high-level strategies to daily operational targets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision systems; Perishable inventory management; Substitutable","Analytic hierarchy process; Data envelopment analysis; Discrete event simulation; Inventory control; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Data envelopment analysis technique; Design/methodology/approach; Financial performance; Integration frameworks; Inventory management; Methodological approach; Non-financial measures; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083066571

The display provides a visibility advantage to both the featured product and its category, but it also has consequences for customer traffic and substitution. Academic/practical relevance: Although there has been considerable academic interest in the assortment planning problem (which products to offer?) and in the shelf-space allocation problem (how much space to devote to each product?), little attention has been paid to the problem of where to place products in the store. Promotional display choice can serve as a powerful demand-shaping lever for retailers. A good understanding of this problem can also facilitate a retailer's negotiations with manufacturers. Methodology: We develop analytical insights using a problem formulation based on a nested multinomial logit model of customer choice. Results: When choosing a promotional product from a fixed category, the only possible optimal choices for promotional display lie along an “efficient set” drawn in terms of product popularities and margins. The optimal choice along the frontier depends on a quantity we call “aisle attractiveness” that depends on several category-level parameters. The value of the display to a category pivots on whether the display's role is primarily to expand demand for the category or to shape substitution within the category. Managerial implications: Our work provides guidance for how retailers can use and value promotional displays effectively. We highlight the importance of considering externalities of a display decision on store traffic and demand for other products. © 2019 INFORMS",,"Logistic regression; Assortment planning; Managerial implications; Multinomial logit model; Problem definition; Problem formulation; Promotional displays; Promotional products; Shelf space allocation; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092636491

We argue that this influence can shape the earliest strategic choices of a new venture by creating a potential trade-off between two objectives: rapid growth and reaping the benefits of a positive reputation (glory). We leverage a simple reputation-building strategic choice-naming the firm after the founder (eponymy)-that is associated with superior profitability. Next, we argue via a formal model that the availability of/dependence on external financing can explain why high-growth firms are rarely eponymous. We find empirical support for the model's predictions using a large data set of 1 million European firms. Eponymous firms grow considerably more slowly than similarly profitable firms. Moreover, eponymy varies in accordance with the firm's financing environment in a pattern consistent with our model. We discuss implications for the literature on new-venture strategy.

To do so, we consider the whole supply chain, we use daily data and we depart from the current practice in the literature that focuses on prices. Rather, we consider the mark-ups of both the refineries and retailers. Hence, we show that we first need to assess whether the refineries' mark-up responds asymmetrically to the international crude oil prices and subsequently whether the retailers' mark-up shows an asymmetric behaviour relatively to changes in the refined fuel prices. Focusing in Greece as our case study, our findings show that Greek fuel retailers do not change their mark-up behaviour based on changes of the refined fuel price. By contrast, the asymmetric behaviour is evident in the refineries' mark-up relatively to changes in the international crude oil prices, which is then passed through to the retailers and consumers. Finally, we provide evidence that weekly and monthly data mask any such asymmetric relationship.

The wide variety in the CTI service offerings by different providers makes it difficult for the security experts to decide which service provider is most suitable according to their security program requirements. Current approaches for ranking CTI service providers are based on a limited set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and do not consider the customer's security program relevance and requirements. In this work, an extensive set of KPI to rank CTI service providers is defined. This paper proposes a framework, which is a first of its kind that assigns weights to KPI based on the customer's requirements and ranks CTI service providers.

Economic development incentives are a key policy tool used at the state and local levels to promote local economic growth, and, presumably, provide employment opportunities. However, these incentives may have unintended consequences that may be contributing to the decline of the middle class. The authors combine detailed industry-level detail on incentives with proprietary county-level industry employment data and two methods for defining middle-class industries. Using an instrumental variable approach, the authors estimate how differential economic development policies affect middle-class jobs. The authors find evidence that incentivizing creative-class and high-wage industries may be contributing to the hollowing out of the middle class. Without hurting employment in other industries, targeting working-class and middle-wage industries alleviates this trend, while reducing incentives on creative-class and high-wage industries could help increase working and middle-class employment. © The Author(s) 2020.","cities; economic development; incentives; middle class","class; economic development; economic growth; economic policy; employment; incentive; urban area; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081595174

Answering these broader questions allows factoring how firms might respond to new-normal conditions; and yields normative implications regarding the transformational strategies – and policies – that enhance productivity growth and reverse new-normal stagnation.

These data sets are a growing source of revenue for their owners—one that can generate millions of dollars each year. Given its proprietary nature, the value of the data to a potential buyer is often uncertain to both parties. Therefore, a mutually acceptable price is usually arrived at through a process of negotiation. A seller can choose to provide a demonstration (demo; presentation) to mitigate this uncertainty and/or reduce bias. We adapt a generalization of Nash bargaining to identify when such demonstrations are appropriate and when they are not. We find that a moderately high-valued outside option can help the seller gain from a demonstration even when the buyer is not underestimating the value of the data. Demonstrations can also be useful when the buyer is biased and underestimates data set value. When both an outside option and underestimation exist, the provision of a demo that corrects for bias can make otherwise unsuccessful negotiations succeed; it also has the potential to trigger the provision of uncertainty-reducing information in the demo. In the presence of a demo cost, the seller can provide a partially informative demo; demos can also mitigate the effects of cannibalization up to a point.

Instead, digital entrepreneurs now pursue locations that provide more opportunities for funding (rounds) and greater social network support. In this paper, we empirically estimate the role of social networks and funding opportunities in a location on entrepreneurs' decisions to create a start-up in their existing or a new location. We use economic indicators made publicly available by the U.S. government; investment information from CrunchBase and PricewaterhouseCoopers; and demographics, professional histories, and network data from LinkedIn. Analysis of 1,418 entrepreneurs who successfully secured funding suggests that funding rounds per year play a significant and positive role in influencing start-up creation in that location, and local social network density creates stickiness to that location, thus negatively influencing entrepreneurs' willingness to relocate. If entrepreneurs do relocate, we assume that they will create a start-up immediately or delay it only by a short time. In the latter case, our results show that larger social network density (in a new location) affects start-up creation decision. Additionally, we find empirical evidence that midcareer individuals (like millennials) are more likely than early-career or late-career-stage individuals to create a successful technology start-up in the same or a new location. Also, entrepreneurs are less likely to relocate for an Internet-based start-up but are likely to move if they have larger social network density in the new location. This research enhances our understanding of the factors that influence decisions to launch a start-up in a particular location and contributes to the limited literature on technology entrepreneurship in the field of information systems.

Such points represent a promise for future service, and their monetary value thus counts as a liability on the issuing firms’ balance sheets. Consequently, adjusting the value of points has a first-order effect on profitability and performance and emerges as a core operating decision. We study the problem of optimally setting the points’ value in view of their associated liabilities. Academic/practical relevance: Firms across numerous industries increasingly utilize LPs. The sheer magnitude of LPs coupled with recent changes in accounting rules have turned the associated liabilities into significant balance-sheet items, amounting to billions of dollars. Managers (from chief financial officers to chief marketing officers) struggle with the problem of adjusting the points’ value in view of these liabilities. Academic work is primarily aimed at understanding LPs as marketing tools, without studying the liability angle. Methodology: We develop a multiperiod model and use dynamic programming techniques and comparative statics analysis. Results: We show that the optimal policies depend on a new financial metric, given by the sum of the firm’s realized cash flows and outstanding deferred revenue, which we refer to as the profit potential. The total value of loyalty points is set to hit a particular target, which increases with the profit potential. We find that loyalty programs can act as buffers against uncertainty, with the value of points increasing (decreasing) under strong (weak) operating performance and increasing with uncertainty. Managerial implications: Setting the point values and adjusting operating decisions in view of LP liabilities should be done by tracking the firm’s profit potential. Loyalty programs can act as hedging tools against uncertainty in future operating performance, which provides a new rationale for their existence, even in the absence of competition. © 2019 INFORMS.","Dynamic programming; Liabilities; Loyalty programs; OM-accounting interface; Risk management","Commerce; Dynamic programming; Managers; Marketing; Profitability; Service industry; Chief financial officers; Comparative statics; Dynamic programming techniques; First order effect; Managerial implications; Multiperiod models; Operating performance; Problem definition; Product liability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084707768

Expert evaluation is an alternative direct method of judging thicket membership at the individual patent level.

Although the supply of nursing homes is still short in quantity, a structural imbalance on the utilization of nursing homes has appeared in many cities of China recently. Namely, when elderly people wait a long time for a bed of downtown nursing homes, many suburban ones are not fully utilized. Purpose: This paper aims to reveal the elderly people's preferences for the nursing homes, in order to clarify the reason for utilization imbalance and put forward the efficient strategies for planning practice. Method: A stated preference survey was undertaken to collect the choice data of respondents (n=293) in Shanghai, 2013. Discrete choice models were used in data analysis to explain the mechanism of preferences. Findings: All seven attributes of nursing homes significantly affect elderly people's preferences. Disparities on the medical condition, transportation, and distance to home between downtown and suburban nursing homes are the leading cause of utilization imbalance. By optimizing the configuration of those factors, the crowded downtown elderly people could be attracted to suburban nursing homes. Finally, the mechanism was applied to a simulation of nursing home planning. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Choice preference; Elderly people; Nursing homes; Shanghai; Spatial configuration","Behavioral research; Nursing; Surveys; Choice preference; Elderly people; Nursing homes; Shanghai; Spatial configuration; Hospitals; aging population; elderly care; elderly population; health services; preference behavior; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078143923

Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative descriptive survey comprising face-to-face semi-structured interviews and a purposive sampling method, views of eight groups of tradespeople and seven project managers on live construction projects in Nigeria were collected. The study used conventional content analysis with the aid of NVivo 12 pro computer software for the analysis. Findings: The research evaluated the PSCs and their effect on construction productivity of tradespeople. The findings identified five key PSCs, namely: lack of promotions/reward system, unsafe/poor health condition of workers, delay in material availability, inadequate site amenities and an ageing workforce. These results support earlier research on constraints influencing labour productivity, however, the poor health condition of workers and material unavailability appear to be more unique when compared to other previous studies. Research limitations/implications: The study focussed on the Federal Capital Territory Abuja and the Lagos State of Nigeria. It provides insight into the PSCs influencing the productivity of tradespeople in the Nigerian construction industry. Further research to identify the PSCs in depth, in the Eastern part of Nigeria is necessary. Practical implications: The PSCs influencing tradespeople’s productivity was identified. The level of the relative impact of the PSCs is expected to guide the project team in addressing the PSCs in a method that is cost effective. Originality/value: This study is original research that has underlined some areas of improvement in construction project performance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Constraints; Construction; Construction works; Productivity; Projects; Specific; Tradespeople",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074322440

Higher information asymmetry (lower transparency) could increase the information cost for investors to distinguish between good and bad investments and thus impede investment, particularly, FDI in which investors are “information disadvantageous of alien”. FDI is an important determinant of productivity growth. Naturally, we connect the two key economic variables and study the influence of information asymmetry on productivity through the channel of FDI. We use data from China’s publicly listed manufacturing firms. Based on a market micro-structure model, we estimate the unobserved information asymmetry using the probability of informed trading (PIN). We estimate the unobserved firm-level productivity using the proxy variable method, assuming that the evolution of productivity is not exogenous but can be shifted by FDI. We find that information asymmetry affects the productivity of domestic firms both positively and negatively, depending on firms’ technology-intensity. When domestic firms are technology-intensive, they can benefit from the knowledge spillovers of FDI. In that case, we find lower information asymmetry, associated with more FDI, results in higher productivity. When domestic firms are non-technology-intensive, they can be hurt by the foreign competition. In this case, we find that lower information asymmetry results in lower productivity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Foreign direct investment; Information asymmetry; Productivity; Spillover",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074819011

We develop a novel modelling approach to estimate possible disproportional substitution patterns among these alternatives by including cross-effects in site-specific utility functions, combining mixed and universal logit models. The latter model allows for more flexibility in substitution patterns than random parameters and error-components in mixed logit models. The model is relevant to any discrete choice study that compares multiple sites that vary in their comparability and that may be perceived as (imperfect) substitutes. Applying the model in an empirical case study shows that accounting for cross-effects results in a better model fit. We discuss the validity of welfare estimates based on the inclusion of cross-effects.

We advance a theoretical perspective that explains how the increasingly socially infused nature of networking applications shapes generations of individuals — some of whom will go on to become creative developers in the software industry. Our perspective suggests software organizations can leverage developers who have been precocious users of more recent social networking technologies to reinforce intuitive usage, promote social impact, and re-energize experimentation and contribution to the software community.

To this end, we develop a game-theoretic model that involves an Internet Service Provider (ISP), two competing content providers (CPs)—one an ad-supported CP, the other ad-free—and consumers. While previous studies have separately examined vertical integration and zero-rated content, none to our knowledge has explored the simultaneous interaction of both phenomena, which became apparent after the historic merger of AT&T and Time Warner. This vertical integration of an ISP and a CP has sparked an intense debate among policymakers and practitioners alike over the economic implications and consequent business practices (e.g., zero-rated content). The results of our analysis show that an ISP can generate higher profits after the merger with zero-rated content. Surprisingly, we find that the consumer valuation of the ad-free content significantly affects how the ISP will decide to maximize its profit. We extend our model to additionally consider the CPs’ partial sponsorship of their consumers’ data usage as well as the ISP’s different pricing schemes for its consumers and the CPs. Our analysis, which illustrates the various arrangements between vertical integration and zero-rated content, and our findings on consumer surplus and social welfare should be helpful to policymakers as well as to the ISPs, CPs, and consumers of digital content. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","ad-free content; ad-supported content; content provider; game-theoretic model; Internet Service Provider; ISP; Vertical integration; zero rating","Economic analysis; Game theory; Integration; Merging; Profitability; Business practices; Consumer valuations; Content providers; Digital contents; Economic implications; Game-theoretic model; Internet service providers (ISP); Vertical integration; Internet service providers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096936389

Design/methodology/approach: At the initial stage of this study, a list of significant risks is identified and gathered through literature review. These risks are then mapped onto tender evaluation criteria. Following this, the identified risks and their mappings are validated through a questionnaire survey to determine appropriate criteria for tender evaluation. Weightings for the selected evaluation criteria are established through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) group decision-making (GDM) method. Findings: In practice, different lists of criteria, covering tender's technical capability and financial performance, are often used by different client organisations.

With the NFL having only eight home games a year per team, it is more of an event than other North American sports. We explore this in terms of how sensitive fans are to weather, by not only looking at traditional factors, but also other weather variables available through Accuweather. In addition, the authors explore team success, outcome uncertainty and other factors as determinants of demand. Design/methodology/approach: The method includes Tobit model of attendance in terms of percent of capacity in the National Football League. Model includes factors such as outcome uncertainty, team success, etc. but mainly focuses on weather. Weather factors studied include traditional variables such as temperature and precipitation, and also includes cloud cover, barometric pressure, wind speed and humidity. Different model specifications are included to explore results. Key findings allow for differences between games played outdoors versus indoors. Findings: In terms of control variables, team success, new stadiums and stadium age play a significant role in attendance in terms of percentage of capacity. Outcome uncertainty does not appear to be important, and fans desire the opposite when the home team is an underdog. The main results concern the weather. When only traditional weather variables are included, precipitation plays a key role. With further expansion of the weather variables, it appears that cloud cover offers some additional information beyond precipitation. In addition, barometric pressure plays a minor, but statistically significant role as it relates to attendance in terms of capacity. Research limitations/implications: Including deeper and richer weather data helps to further explain attendance at sporting events. With the NFL, this may be limited by it being such as event due to the scarcity of games in a season. In addition, the weather variables are not truly independent, although they are not as correlated as may be anticipated on the surface. Use of different types of weather variables in models of attendance may help to deepen our understanding of factors influencing consumer decisions. These factors may play larger roles in sports with wider variance in attendance during the season. Practical implications: The practical implications are that other weather-related variables besides temperature and precipitation may offer insight into consumer decisions related to attendance at sporting events. Cloud cover gives insights into anticipated poor weather in addition to it directly leading to less of a sunny day to be outdoors at an event. Barometric pressure has been shown to influence headaches and joint pain and may also influence consumer decisions to venture out to sporting events. Social implications: As data becomes more widely available in general, it's possible to add additional insights into factors influencing various forms of decision-making. In this study, we show that more information on weather can shed insights into consumer decisions as it relates to attending events such as sports. These decisions likely differ based upon whether the event is held outdoors or indoors. With more entertainment choices as substitutes, it is important to identify key factors which influence consumer decisions to help better structure events in the future. Originality/value: Weather variables beyond temperature and precipitation are included in a Tobit model for NFL attendance using percentage of capacity as the dependent variable. These weather variables are cloud cover, wind speed, humidity, and barometric pressure. Cloud cover and barometric pressure were found to have some significant effects on percentage of capacity.

The study uses mixed research methods as an inquiry to combining both qualitative and quantitative forms. Reporting data from 487 business owners extracted from a 2017 nationally representative survey of 8,533 households in Kosovo, 47.7 percent had started-up unregistered and were operating informally at the time of the survey. Using an instrumental variable (IV) estimation with a binary endogenous regressor to estimate the impact of informality (a treatment group) on small firm growth (control group), while controlling for other entrepreneur and firm determinants, a strong positive effect of the informality on firm growth is identified. Entrepreneurs operating informally had an 11.6 percentage points higher probability of achieving their firm growth objectives compared with entrepreneurs operating formally. Yet, the qualitative interviews revealed that growth objectives of small firms were limited, so the unregistered firms outperformed registered firms only under the modest growth objectives.

Such an adaptation requires the adoption of adequate cultural frameworks as Hofstede's 6-D Model (Hofstede et al., 2010). A major limitation of Hofstede's model is the missing consideration for regional and subcultural differences within the same country. Such a limitation may affect the success of HRD initiatives, as undertaken by global companies in a specific context. OBJECTIVE: This research intends to test Hofstede's 6-D Model (Hofstede et al., 2010) at the subcultural level using the case of a multinational company operating in the North and Northwest regions of Morocco, and to provide a critical analysis of this theory as to its applicability in the context of multinational organizations. METHODS: A quantitative survey-based study was considered for this research, using the Value Survey Module 2013 (VSM). The sample included the managers and professional workers of the Moroccan subsidiary of a multinational company from various cities in two regions. A descriptive approach was adopted to interpret the main features from the collected data. The collected scores were then treated using SPSS and XLSTAT to conduct the T-test statistical analysis, allowing also for a critical analysis of the subcultural value scores. RESULTS: The results of this study show differences between the cultural value dimensions in the subcultures of the North and Northwest of Morocco and the national culture. The comparison of the scores between North and Northwest regions of Morocco and Hofstede's Moroccan national score following the T-test statistical analysis shows differences between at least four indices in both regions, leading to the conclusion that the regional cultural scores are statistically different from national scores. CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of HRD in contributing to learning and change strategies and the importance of aligning leadership development approaches with the cultural values of multinational organizations, this study provides a further understanding of how subcultures represent important platforms for building contextualized HRD systems that foster managerial effectiveness and performance. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

I highlight that a firm's structure shapes not only the locus of decision-making power (i.e., centralization and decentralization) but also the employees' interaction structure. I develop microlevel theory that connects the firm's structure to the interactions among its employees—for instance, its influence on the time employees spend adjusting their behavior after a reorganization. This theory predicts that some structures are more likely than others to promote a reorganization to occur sooner. I use a unique, hand-collected data set of reorganizations in the cell-phone manufacturing industry to test and find directional support for this theory. Managerial Summary: I examine the effect of a firm's current structure on its corporate reorganization decisions, which are defined as the addition and/or removal of business units. I posit that the way employees are grouped into those business units may affect both the type and timing of subsequent reorganizations; the reason is that employees of similar (resp. different) backgrounds should need less (resp. more) time to achieve effective collaboration. Using data on the reorganizations of cell-phone manufacturing firms during 1983–2008, I find directional support for the theory. This result implies that managers may need to watch closely any reorganization that shifts the firm toward more heterogeneous interaction structures—because its implementation may well require additional time. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cell-phone industry; corporate strategy; organization design; organization structure; reorganizations","Decision making; Managers; Manufacture; Statistical tests; Timing circuits; Cell phone industry; Corporate strategies; Organization design; Organization structures; reorganizations; Cellular telephones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071843408

The study demonstrates that interactive data visualization of operational processes can be an enabler in overcoming organizational resistance to big data technologies in a change-resistant organization.

However, resource-constrained regulators face a great challenge in detecting insider trading and enforcing insider trading laws. We develop a text analytics framework that uses machine learning to predict ex-ante potentially opportunistic insider trading (using actual insider trading allegation by shareholders as the proxy) from corporate textual disclosures. Distinct from typical black-box neural network models, which have difficulty tracing a prediction back to key features, our approach combines the predictive power of deep learning with attention mechanisms to provide interpretability to the model. Further, our model utilizes representations from a business proximity network and incorporates the temporal variations of a firm's financial disclosures.

Intensified rainfall, increasing imperviousness, and insufficient drainage capacity contribute to the increase of pluvial flood risk. The strategy of risk mitigation relies on the understanding of these controlling factors of urban pluvial flooding. However, spatial heterogeneity of the impacts of controlling factors has received limited attention. This study analyzes how topography, rainfall, impervious surfaces affect urban pluvial flooding and how the effects vary in space. A case study in the city of Cincinnati, US based on four storm events in recent years is conducted. The impact of topography is measured by a depression-based empirical parameter, Topographic Control Index (TCI), which is generated based on depression ponding volume, contributing area, and upstream slope. Rainfall depth estimated from kriging interpolation method is used to measure how the rainfall affect the urban pluvial flooding. The impervious area ratio of the contributing area of each depression as well as that of observed flooded locations are calculated to analyze the influence of impervious area. The results showed that TCI value and rainfall intensity are spatially correlated with the presence of flooded locations, and flooded locations can be classified into two types: rainfall control or topography control. The imperviousness of land surface does not show a significant correlation with pluvial flood due to the relatively small spatial variation of impervious area in a well-developed city. The framework in this study could identify the spatial distribution of dominant controlling factors for pluvial flooding, which is critical for the effective planning of mitigation measures. © 2020","Cincinnati; Depression; Rainfall intensity; Spatial heterogeneity; Topographic control index; Urban pluvial flooding","correlation; data interpretation; flooding; kriging; numerical model; precipitation intensity; spatial analysis; streamflow; topography; Cincinnati; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095765760

To infer a decision, a consistent or near-consistent matrix is desired, and therefore, several methods have been developed to control or improve the overall consistency of the matrix. However, controlling the overall consistency does not necessarily prevent having strong local inconsistencies. Local inconsistencies are local distortions which can lead to rank reversal when a new alternative is added or deleted. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm for controlling the inconsistency during the construction of the pairwise comparison matrix. The proposed algorithm assists decision makers whilst entering their judgments and does not allow strong local inconsistencies. This algorithm is based on the transitivity rule and has been verified through statistical simulations. Appropriate thresholds of acceptable evaluations have been inferred from these simulations. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is a helpful decision aid to decision makers when entering pairwise comparison judgments. © 2020, Associazione per la Matematica Applicata alle Scienze Economiche e Sociali (AMASES).","AHP; Consistency ratio; Decision making; Multi-criteria; Rank reversal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095583930

Our paper uses objective Bayesian method to identify important variables for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) over the dengue data set. With the selected important variables by objective Bayesian method, we employ a Gaussian copula marginal regression model considering correlation error structure and a general method of semi-parametric Bayesian inference for Gaussian copula model to estimate, separately, the marginal distribution and dependence structure. We also carry out a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for the predictive model for DHF and compare our proposed model with the other models of Ju and Brasier (Variable selection methods for developing a biomarker panel for prediction of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Following Camillo Lamanna and Lauren Byrne, we call this technology the autonomy algorithm (AA). Such an algorithm would mine medical research, health records, and social media data to predict patient treatment preferences. The possibility of developing the AA raises the ethical question of whether the AA or a relative ought to serve as surrogate decision-maker in cases where the patient has not issued a medical power of attorney. We argue that in such cases, and against the standard practice of vesting familial surrogates with decision making authority, the AA should have sole decision-making authority. This is because the AA will likely be better at predicting what treatment option the patient would have chosen. It would also be better at avoiding bias and, therefore, choosing in a more patient-centered manner. Furthermore, we argue that these considerations override any moral weight of the patient’s special relationship with their relatives. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Biomedical; Decision-making; Ethics; Surrogate","artificial intelligence; decision making; human; morality; patient preference; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Humans; Morals; Patient Preference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091377475

Design/methodology/approach: The current study utilizes data envelopment analysis (DEA) to develop a combined queuing–DEA model as applied to evaluate the wait times of patients, within different stages of the outpatients' department at the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Lahore, Pakistan, over a period of seven weeks (23rd April to 28th May 2014). The number of doctors/personnel and consultation time were considered as outputs, where consultation time was the non-discretionary output. The two inputs were wait time and length of queue. Additionally, VBA programming in Excel has been utilized to develop the dynamic framework for continuous queue monitoring. Findings: The inadequate availability of personnel was observed as the critical issue for long wait times, along with overcrowding and variable arrival pattern of walk-in patients. The DEA model displayed the “required” number of personnel, corresponding to different wait times, indicating queue build-up. Originality/value: The current study develops a queue evaluation model for a busy outpatients' department in a public hospital, where “all” patients are walk-in and no appointment systems. This model provides vital information in the form of “required” number of personnel which allows the administrators to control the queue pre-emptively minimizing wait times, with optimal yet dynamic staff allocation. Additionally, the dynamic framework specifically targets practical implementation in resource-poor public hospitals of emerging economies for continuous queue monitoring. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absence of appointment system; Data envelopment analysis; Developing economy; Public health system; Queuing theory; Waiting time","administrative personnel; adult; article; consultation; crowding (area); economic aspect; human; military hospital; outpatient; Pakistan; public health; public hospital; case report",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095854082

Design/methodology/approach: The forecasting tools were tested using 27 products of the nail polish line of a multinational beauty company and the performance of said tools was compared to those of the company’s previous forecasting methods that were basically qualitative (informal and intuition-based). Findings: The performance of the methods analyzed was compared by using mean absolute percentage error. It was possible to determine the characteristics and conditions that make each model the best for each situation. The main takeaways were that low kurtosis, negatively skewed demand time-series and longer horizon forecasts that favor the fuzzy inference system-based models. Besides, the results suggest that the fuzzy forecasting tools should be preferred for longer horizon forecasts over informal qualitative methods. Originality/value: Notwithstanding the proposed hybrid modeling approach based on fuzzy inference systems, our research offers a relevant contribution to theory and practice by shedding light on the segmentation and selection of forecasting models, both in terms of time-series characteristics and forecasting horizon. The proposed fuzzy inference systems showed to be particularly useful not only when time-series distributions present no clear central tendency (that is, they are platykurtic or dispersed around a large plateau around the median, which is the characteristic of negative kurtosis), but also when mode values are greater than median values, which in turn are greater than mean values. This large tail to the left (negative skewness) is typical of successful products whose sales are ramping up in early stages of their life cycle. For these, fuzzy inference systems may help managers screen out forecast bias and, therefore, lower forecast errors. This behavior also occurs when managers deal with forecasts of longer horizons. The results suggest that further research on fuzzy inference systems hybrid approaches for forecasting should emphasize short-term forecasting by trying to better capture the “tribal” managerial knowledge instead of focusing on less dispersed and slower moving products, where the purely qualitative forecasting methods used by managers tend to perform better in terms of their accuracy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Forecasting; Fuzzy inference system; Genetic algorithm; Neural network; Soft computing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079703245

Academic/practical relevance: Our work is in the area of agriculture operations, and we focus on the improvement of farmer’s expected total profit by optimizing planting schedules. Methodology: We model a farmer’s planting problem under limited planting capacity in a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic program. Results: We show that the optimal planting policy is a time-dependent, threshold-type policy, and the optimal threshold is dependent on the soil water content and planting capacity. In our computational study, we use the well-known Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer simulator used in agriculture to obtain the expected yield when planting in any given period. Utilizing field weather data from Southern Africa, in a real-size, large-scale problem, we demonstrate a significant relative profit advantage of the optimal planting schedule over commonly used heuristics in practice. We show that the relative advantage of the optimal policy increases as the climate condition becomes more severe for planting. We also develop a heuristic based on the secretary problem and demonstrate the increased efficacy of the secretary heuristic. Managerial implications: We show that the farmer should plant down to the optimal threshold of seed amount. However, in practice, farmers start to plant each year after observing enough cumulative rainfall. Utilizing field weather data, in a real-size, large-scale problem, we show significant improvement of the expected total profit if the farmer could adopt the optimal policy.

This study investigates the association between temperature and assaults in the city of Seoul, South Korea. It also examines how interaction between temperature and socio-economic variables relates to assaults. Monthly assault counts in small administrative units for a 36-month period are described with Bayesian Poisson models. Employing the space-time structure of the dataset, these Poisson models are specified with a set of spatial and/or temporal effects and estimated with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).

We propose an optimization-based framework that systematically takes into account the trade-offs between process safety and supply chain economics for decision-making. We quantify the hazard at various supply chain echelons in the form of a safety index that takes both fire and toxic hazards into account. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)-based model is developed to either maximize profit for specified hazard limits, or to minimize hazard in a supply chain with multiple production plants, technological options, warehouses and distribution nodes. The MINLP model is used to generate trade-off optimal solutions for various toxic and fire hazard limits. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to an end-to-end ammonia supply chain case study which resulted in several non-intuitive observations regarding hazardous supply chain design and optimization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hazard; MINLP; Process safety index; Supply chain network optimization","Ammonia; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Hazards; Integer programming; International trade; Nonlinear programming; Chemical supply chains; Hazardous chemicals; Inherent safety; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Optimal solutions; Production plant; Supply chain design; Supply chain optimization; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089882673

We argue that energy access is both a technical and an economic issue, and hence the integrity of firms' financial information is a key monitoring mechanism. We analyze the impact of financial information integrity on firms' access to energy in 138 developing countries. Our results show that the integrity of financial information is a robust predictor of firm's access to energy. The decision of a firm to have its financial accounts externally audited is associated with a higher probability of better access to energy. The effect depends on country size, but not country development. Other important aspects of business operation, such as financing and corruption, also affect energy access. The financial information integrity effect on energy access depends on the firm's size, industry and geographical location. Country-level macroeconomic, auditing and energy infrastructure conditions play a role too. Economic and financial development, economic openness, the accounting and auditing environment and the technical conditions of energy generation in a country are important controlling factors of the financial information integrity effect. Policy considerations in the developing world aiming at improving firms' access to energy must pay attention to the role of external monitoring mechanisms and the conditions that induce firms to embrace higher level and quality of external auditing. © 2020","Developing countries; Energy constraints; Financial information integrity; Institutions","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Business operation; Controlling factors; Energy infrastructures; Financial development; Financial information; Geographical locations; Monitoring mechanisms; Technical conditions; Investments; accessibility; developing world; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; financial system; industrial structure; institutional framework; macroeconomics; policy approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094930358

Existing cybersecurity frameworks are complex and implementation oriented. The framework can be systematically used to assess the strategic orientation of a firm with respect to its cybersecurity posture. The goal is to assist top-management-team with tailoring their decision-making about security investments while managing cyber risk at their organization. Design/methodology/approach: A thematic analysis of existing publications using content analysis techniques generates the initial set of keywords of significance. Additional factor analysis using the keywords provides us with a framework comprising of five pillars comprising prioritize, resource, implement, standardize and monitor (PRISM) for assessing a firm’s strategic cybersecurity orientation. Findings: The primary contribution is the development of a novel PRISM framework, which enables cyber decision-makers to identify and operationalize a tailored approach to address risk management and cybersecurity problems. PRISM framework evaluation will help organizations identify and implement the most tailored risk management and cybersecurity approach applicable to their problem(s).

Extant research has primarily focused on providing decision aids and eliminating “distracting” features to help consumers' conscious thought when making complex decisions. Our research adopts a novel perspective that consumers' unconscious thought may have some advantages and be exploited to help consumers make complex purchase decisions, especially when one's circadian preference (optimal time of day for decision-making, e.g., morning vs. evening) is not met. Drawing on the Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT), we developed two hypotheses regarding the effects of consumers' unconscious thought and its interaction with consumer circadian preference on decision quality. A controlled experiment was conducted to test our hypotheses. The findings show that unconscious thought outperforms conscious thought for making complex product choices in general and such effects are amplified when there is an asynchrony between one's circadian preference and the time of decision.

This study investigates the history of Chinese centralized decentralization reforms in collective forestry using data from government documents and secondary literature based on the democratic decentralization and environmental governance frameworks. Additionally, it divides China's collective forest decentralization reform into three stages since the 1980s—the “economic development” period, “marketization cultivation” period, and “ecological protection” period. Our findings indicate that the effect of decentralization reform is largely due to whether the decentralization reform is consistent with the national government's centralized means/mechanism. In the economic development period (1980–1991), there were two sources of conflict: (1) between the centralized timber market system (unified purchase and sales system in state-owned forest) and the opening of the collective forest timber market; and (2) between the horizontal government upward accountability system and the decentralization of financial power to local governments. In the marketization cultivation period (1992–2002), the conflict between the horizontal government upward accountability system and decentralized financial power to the local government still existed, but the centralized fiscal policy of monetary tightening complemented the full-scale opening of the forestry market. During the ecological protection period (2003-present), the vertical government upward accountability system has complemented the devolution of financial power to forestry departments. We also find that the results of decentralization reforms of the government and market system usually affect the decentralization reform results of the community system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Centralization; China; Collective forestry; Decentralization","Commerce; Decision making; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Finance; Timber; Accountability systems; Cultivation periods; Decentralized decision making; Ecological protection; Environmental governances; Forestry departments; Government documents; National governments; Forestry; Centralization; Commerce; Decision Making; Ecology; Finance; Forestry; Power; Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089024296

Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agency theory; Information processing theory; Paradoxical approaches; Resource dependence theory; Strategic planning committees","Enterprise resource planning; Finance; Agency theory; Collaborative interaction; Information asymmetry; Information processing theories; Organizational scopes; Paradoxical approaches; Resource dependences; Strategic planning process; Strategic planning; asymmetric information; information processing; management; planning process; public sector; strategic approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079423385

Specifically, the authors examine how learning from previous experience and SC disruption-orientation affects organizations’ capability to recover/continuously improve once a SC disruption has manifested. In addition, knowing that organizational inertia likely exists during disruptions, the authors examine the mediating effects of routine rigidity on proposed relationships. Design/methodology/approach: To determine how these antecedents impact an organization’s RCI capabilities, the authors collected survey data from 219 procurement managers and analyzed these records using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that by fostering SC disruption-orientation and developing competencies to learn from previous experience, firms can enhance their RCI capabilities, which in turn improves operational performance. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate how routine rigidity mediates the positive effects these antecedents have on the RCI capabilities construct. Originality/value: By developing these risk management (RM) tactics and managing routine rigidity, organizations broaden their continuous improvement capability, which enables practitioners to respond to and recover from manifest disruptions. When used in conjunction with other RM tactics, such as inventory and/or redundant capacity, organizations can address an array of disruption scenarios. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Purchasing; Supply chain management; Surveys","Purchasing; Rigidity; Risk management; Supply chain management; Surveying; Surveys; Continuous improvements; Design/methodology/approach; Mediating effect; Operational performance; Organizational inertia; Structural equation modeling; Supply-chain disruptions; Survey data; Recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074351256

Demand is random and price sensitive, and unsatisfied demands are lost and unobservable (censored demand). The firm knows the demand process up to some parameters and needs to learn them through pricing and inventory experimentation. However, because of business constraints, the firm is prevented from making frequent price changes, leading to correlated and dependent sales data. We develop data-driven algorithms by actively experimenting inventory and pricing decisions and construct maximum likelihood estimator with censored and correlated samples for parameter estimation. We analyze the algorithms using the T-period regret, defined as the profit loss of the algorithms over T periods compared with the clairvoyant optimal policy that knew the parameters a priori. For a so-called well-separated case, we show that the regret of our algorithm is O(T1/ (m+1)) when the number of price changes is limited by m ≥ 1 and is O(log T) when limited by β log T for some positive constant β &gt; 0, whereas for a more general case, the regret is O(T1/2) when the underlying demand is bounded and O(T1/2 log T) when the underlying demand is unbounded. We further prove that our algorithm for each case is the best possible in the sense that its regret rate matches with the theoretical lower bound.

Moreover, the results indicated that this increase is visible in all four dimensions of CSR considered in this study: employee, environmental, human rights, and social and community.

We investigate an inventory transshipment game with two newsvendor-type retailers under limited total supply and check whether the retailers are better off than the case without transshipment. We derive the ordering strategies for the retailers and show that unlike the unlimited supply case, a pure Nash equilibrium only exists under certain conditions. Furthermore, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we show that inventory transshipment may not always benefit both retailers. Although one of the retailers is guaranteed to be better off, the other could be worse off. The decision criteria are then provided for the retailers to determine if they will benefit from the exercise of inventory transshipment. Numerical study indicates that the carefully chosen transshipment prices play an important role in keeping inventory transshipment beneficial to both retailers.

We define a large spatial TFP growth center as a firm that is a large net generator of spatial TFP growth spillovers, i.e., it is a source of large TFP growth spill-outs to other firms vis-à-vis the size of the TFP growth spill-ins that permeate to the firm from other firms. We use this definition because, other things being equal, firms would want to locate near a firm that is a net generator of TFP growth spillovers. In the process of presenting the above method we make three further contributions, two of which are methodological and the other relates to our application. First, rather than follow the literature on spatial frontier modeling by considering spatial interaction between firms in a single network, we introduce a more sophisticated model that is able to account for spatial interaction in multiple networks. Second, we obtain bidirectional spatial TFP growth decompositions by complementing a unidirectional decomposition in the literature, where the spillover components are spill-ins to a firm, with a decomposition that includes spill-out components. Third, from a spatial revenue frontier for U.S. banks (1998–2015), we find a number of cases where banks that represent large spatial TFP growth centers have branches that cluster together, while in several states we find no such clusters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Multiple spatial networks; Productivity and competitiveness; Revenue function; Spatial stochastic frontier analysis; U.S. banks","Stochastic systems; Multiple networks; Productivity and competitiveness; Revenue function; Single networks; Spatial interaction; Spatial network; Spatial stochastic; Total factor productivity; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081201756

In the truckload (TL) sector, the prevailing assumption is that TL carriers face constant returns to scale such that productivity differs little between large and small carriers. While empirical findings from several studies conducted since deregulation are consistent with this assumption, we contend that the true relationship between carrier size and productivity is more nuanced and is contingent on carriers' level of technical efficiency. Specifically, we develop and test middle range theory that predicts increasing returns to scale for carriers with low technical efficiency, constant returns to scale for carriers with average technical efficiency, and decreasing returns to scale for carriers with high technical efficiency. We test our theory by estimating production functions using quantile regression for data collected from the U.S. Department of Transportation for 1,068 TL carriers.

We use two proxies related to investor ex ante uncertainty and corresponding pricing of such uncertainty: option-implied volatilities and variance risk premiums; both are measured with maturities surrounding the impending quarterly earnings announcement. Consistent with prior research, we measure reporting streak as the number of consecutive quarters the firm meets or beats the consensus analyst earnings-per-share forecast. Empirical results confirm expectations that the two uncertainty-related constructs are decreasing in the length of the reporting streak. These results, combined with further evidence documenting that lower uncertainty leads to lower stock returns surrounding the earnings announcements, suggest that longer reporting streaks reflect lower risk during earnings announcements. © 2019 INFORMS","Earnings announcements; Implied volatilities; Meet or beat analyst forecasts; Reporting streak; Uncertainty; Variance risk premium","Earnings; Investments; Earnings per share; Ex antes; Implied volatility; Stock returns; Variance risk premiums; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090229234

This paper addresses this gap, defining OOS work as an activity or series of activities that was not performed according to baseline planned logical productive sequencing. By developing a project-based survey and contacting 300 professionals, extensive data were gathered from 42 projects. Using these data, the impacts of OOS were examined. It was found that, on average, approximately 15% of project activities are performed as OOS, resulting in 33% growth in construction schedule and 25% additional construction cost. Applying statistical analysis verified that, at 95% confidence level, OOS has a statistically significant inverse correlation with the productivity index, and a significant direct correlation with cost growth, schedule growth, and value of punchlist items. On average, a 5% increase in OOS was shown to be associated with an 8.5% drop in productivity, 10% increase in construction cost, and 11% increase in construction schedule. Regarding safety, no conclusive statistically significant relationships were found between OOS and the examined safety metrics, possibly because safety measures were followed regardless of sequencing. Investigating 19 project factors, the study highlighted statistically significant relationships between OOS and 15 leading indicators, at 95% confidence level. For example, implementing unplanned overtime, trade stacking, rework, as well as request for information (RFI) enumeration and processing time have significant direct correlation with OOS, while overall collaboration among project team members is inversely correlated with OOS. Project complexity, construction pace (traditional versus phased), percent design completion prior to construction, and the use of second shifts were not found to be statistically correlated with OOS. On investigating the level to which projects used five commonly recommended practices (alignment, front-end planning, constructability, planning for startup, and 3D modeling), the study found that the five practices are inversely correlated with OOS, especially when collaboratively implemented early and often throughout the project. Industry practitioners should use the presented findings to address and mitigate OOS and its negative impacts, ultimately enhancing overall project performance. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"3D modeling; Inverse problems; Productivity; Additional construction; Construction schedules; Front-end planning; Inverse correlation; Project activities; Project performance; Recommended practice; Request for informations; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085839794

The availability of these treatment options has an economic impact, therefore a budget impact analysis was performed. Methods: A budget impact analysis was conducted from a Dutch healthcare perspective over a 5-year time horizon in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving first-line afatinib (Gilotrif®) versus first-line osimertinib (Tagrisso®), followed by subsequent treatments. A decision analysis model was constructed in Excel. Scenario analyses and one-way sensitivity analysis were used to test the models’ robustness. Results: Sequential treatment with afatinib versus first-line treatment with osimertinib showed mean total time on treatment (ToT) of 29.1 months versus 24.7 months, quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) of 20.2 versus 17.4 with mean cost of €108,166 per patient versus €143,251 per patient, respectively. The 5-year total budget impact was €110.4 million for the afatinib sequence versus €158.6 million for the osimertinib sequence, leading to total incremental cost savings of €48.15 million. Conclusions: First-line afatinib treatment in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC had a lower financial impact on the Dutch healthcare budget with a higher mean ToT and QALM compared to osimertinib sequential treatment. © 2020, The Author(s).","Afatinib; Budget impact; I15; I18; Osimertinib; Treatment sequencing","afatinib; carboplatin; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor; osimertinib; pemetrexed; acrylamide derivative; afatinib; aniline derivative; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; osimertinib; adult; anemia; Article; budget; cost control; diarrhea; disease burden; drug dose sequence; dyspnea; exon; fatigue; female; health care cost; human; leukopenia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neutropenia; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; paronychia; point mutation; prescription; prevalence; priority journal; progression free survival; quality of life; rash; sensitivity analysis; somatic mutation; stomatitis; survival analysis; survival time; aged; budget; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; economics; genetics; lung tumor; Netherlands; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; quality adjusted life year; Acrylamides; Afatinib; Aged; Aniline Compounds; Antineoplastic Agents; Budgets; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; ErbB Receptors; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Quality-Adjusted Life Years",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084131986

The model maximizes the expected intertemporal utility of households and consists of decisions that are a function of the fund level and oil revenue. We apply our approach to Saudi data, noting that the government deposits and reserve at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency have historically served as a buffer to decouple the Saudi government budget from oil revenue fluctuations. Results from our model match intuition: the larger the fund, the smaller the additions during periods of high revenues and the bigger the withdrawals during periods of low revenues. We also show that the fund can be partitioned into tranches with different asset durations rather than being solely invested in short-term assets. Our results indicate that the boundary between an oil-revenue stabilization fund and a sovereign wealth fund is not a bright line. © 2020 The Authors","Dynamic programming; Oil; Regime switching; Sovereign wealth fund; Stabilization fund; Welfare","Budget control; Proven reserves; Stabilization; Analytical approach; Bright lines; Oil revenues; Optimal policies; Saudi Arabia; Short term; Sovereign wealth funds; Stabilization Fund; Economics; government; oil industry; policy approach; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083499153

Therefore, the form of supplier competition in which the buyer adjust the prices from the suppliers with the quality scores (QS) becomes more popular than that under price-only format, where the decision is made solely based on prices. That said, QS alters the competition between the suppliers in two ways. First, it changes the nature of price competition among the suppliers as the winner needs to offer the lowest QS-adjusted price (not necessarily the lowest price). Second, the specific value of QS for each supplier is only known to the buyer, which gives rise to the credibility issues from the buyer's perspective. Analysing supply competition under QS, in this paper, we characterize the equilibrium prices and evaluate whether or not it is beneficial for the buyer to share QS information with the suppliers in a credible fashion. We identify two factors: (i) degree of homogeneity among the suppliers (as measured by relative QS between the suppliers) and (ii) degree of information asymmetry (as measured by the range of uncertainty for the relative QS). The buyer prefers not to share the relative QS with the suppliers if they are relatively similar to each other in terms of QS. This is because the suppliers engage in a more intensified price competition under information asymmetry compared to when they have access to exact value of the relative QS. However, the opposite holds true if the suppliers become more uncertain about their relative QS. Hence, in this case, the buyer finds sharing QS information with the suppliers beneficial for the sake of lowering equilibrium prices notwithstanding the cost of credible sharing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric information; Credibility; Quality score; Signalling; Supply competition","Competition; Information dissemination; Quality control; Sales; Signaling; Asymmetric information; Credibility; Equilibrium price; Information asymmetry; Information sharing; Lowest price; Price competition; Specific values; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078069890

Using a spatial approach, we analyze returns to scale for banks that are made up of external (i.e., spillover) economies. We extend ray-scale economies (RSE), expansion-path scale economies (EPSE) and expansion-path subadditivity (EPSU) to the spatial case. This involves introducing direct and composite and decomposed indirect RSE, EPSE and EPSU. These direct and indirect measures relate to the cost implications for a firm from a change in: (i) the firm's output levels that are, as is standard, under its control; and (ii) the composite/decomposed spillover effect on the firm's output levels, which is primarily, but not entirely, outside its control. We include an application to U.S. banks (1998–2015) that allows a bank to simultaneously belong to a number of spatial networks, which is typically what we observe for firms. For large banks we find constant direct RSE and EPSE, and zero composite indirect RSE and constant composite indirect EPSE. These composite indirect results do not counteract any policy suggestions from the direct RSE and EPSE concerning the debate on whether there should be size caps on very large U.S. banks. The direct RSE and EPSE for large banks suggest that these banks use society's resources efficiently to provide their services. Size caps on very large banks would place downward pressure on these direct RSE and EPSE results, which could lead to large banks using society's resources inefficiently. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Branch networks; Internal and external returns to scale; Productivity and competitiveness; Spatial cost function","Economics; Expansion; Branch network; Cost-function; Internal and external return to scale; Output levels; Productivity and competitiveness; Return to scale; Scale economies; Spatial cost function; Spatial scale; Subadditivity; Cost functions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078035490

A natural question that arises in this context is: What is the likelihood of a cyber-blackout?, where the latter term is defined as the probability that all (or a major subset of) organizations in a service chain become dysfunctional in a certain manner due to a cyber-attack at some or all points in the chain. The answer to this question has major implications to risk management businesses such as cyber-insurance when it comes to designing policies by risk-averse insurers for providing coverage to clients in the aftermath of such catastrophic network events. In this article, we investigate this question in general as a function of service chain networks and different cyber-loss distribution types. We show somewhat surprisingly (and discuss the potential practical implications) that, following a cyber-attack, the effect of (a) a network interconnection topology and (b) a wide range of loss distributions on the probability of a cyber-blackout and the increase in total service-related monetary losses across all organizations are mostly very small. The primary rationale behind these results are attributed to degrees of heterogeneity in the revenue base among organizations and the Increasing Failure Rate property of popular (i.i.d/non-i.i.d) loss distributions, i.e., log-concave cyber-loss distributions. The result will enable risk-averse cyber-risk managers to safely infer the impact of cyber-attacks in a worst-case network and distribution oblivious setting. © 2020 ACM.","cyber-blackout; Service network; systemic risk","Crime; Economics; Failure analysis; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Network security; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk management; Cyber-attacks; Increasing failure rate; Loss distribution; Modern service; Network interconnections; Service chain; Service disruptions; Service organizations; Malware",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090469868

Empirical data were collected from 196 entrepreneurs and top executives in Chinese high-tech new ventures using an interview survey. An established mediation model's assessment approach was used to test hypotheses through multivariate linear regression analyses. The analysis results show that both effectuation and causation have positive effects on opportunity identification. Also, emergent/planned knowledge integration plays a fully mediating role in the relationship between effectuation/causation and opportunity identification. This research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence to explain the problem of entrepreneurial opportunity identification under high uncertainty through the lens of effectuation theory.

However, many are still reluctant to share, and there is evidence that the extent of sharing would be greater if information sensitive to retailers is concealed before data are shared. Although there has been considerable research into methods to hide sensitive information from transactional data, extant research has focused only on sensitive information at the organizational level. This is rarely the case in reality; the retail industry has recognized and adapted their offerings to region-wide differences in customer tastes for decades, and when stores offer a mix of standardized and customized products, the differences in customer characteristics across regions lead to sensitive information that is region-specific in addition to sensitive information at the organizational level. To date, this version of the problem has been overlooked, and no effective methods exist to solve it; this paper fills that gap. Although some existing approaches can be adapted to this more realistic context, the existence of region-level requirements substantially increases the size of an already difficult (NP-hard) problem to be solved, making such adaptations impractical. Traditional decomposition-based approaches, such as Lagrangian relaxation, are not viable either as they require the repeated solution of NP-hard problems involving millions of variables multiple times. In this paper, we present an ensemble approach that draws intuition from Lagrangian relaxation to maximize the accuracy of a shared transactional dataset. Extensive computational experiments show that this approach not only identifies near-optimal solutions, it can do so even when other approaches fail. We also show that the precision of recommendations made using datasets that have been modified using the ensemble approach is not statistically different from that of recommendations made using the original datasets; this demonstrates that using the ensemble approach to hide sensitive information before sharing transactional data has negligible negative impact.

Actually, this pattern was observed so often that it was termed the ‘resource curse’. The political resource curse predicts that an abundance of natural resources leads to inefficient public policies, due to corruption and rent-seeking. This paper contributes to the discussion by applying Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to determine whether oil rents drive inefficiency in public policies, focusing on the health care sector. The SFA estimated simultaneously a production function for health outputs and the determinants of inefficiency in production. Using a sample of 119 countries covering the period 2000 to 2015, unexpectedly high oil revenues are shown to increase inefficiency. Oil rents hindered countries in reaching their potential life expectancy. Exploiting exogenous variation in the international oil price revealed that causality runs from oil rents to inefficiency and these results are robust to different model specifications - including different production functions and mean inefficiency determinants - the exclusion of oil price maker, time lags of the effect and different definition of price shocks. The effect varied with institutions, sex and age; while the effect was more pronounced in democracies, women and children were also affected more than adult men. Transparency and inequality are potential mechanisms that explain how oil rents leads to inefficiency in the health care sector. Hence, policy implications for democratic oil rich countries could be to invest the oil dividends into poverty reducing policies to battle inequality and reform institutions to increase transparency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Health expenditure; Oil windfalls; Stochastic frontier analysis","Economics; Health care; Public policy; Stochastic systems; Transparency; Determinants of inefficiencies; Health expenditures; Model specifications; Oil windfalls; Policy implications; Potential mechanism; Production function; Stochastic frontier analysis; Developing countries; health care; health expenditure; oil field; oil industry; oil production; price dynamics; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081173850

A multiple correspondence analysis is performed first to explore and describe the data. Second, ordinal regression models are developed to determine what are the critical quality tools that support the companies’ performance in terms of quality, cost, and productivity. This case study shows that the critical quality tools to improve quality performance would be implementing One Piece Flow and GEMBA tools. Next, implementing Value Stream Mapping and Takt Time tools would significantly reduce the cost compared to not implementing those tools. The analysis shows improvement in productivity can be achieved by implementing KANBAN tool. The findings have the potential to guide companies to determine which quality tools are most likely effective in improving quality, productivity, and reducing cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Company performance; Continuous improvement; Lean six sigma; Multiple correspondance analysis; Ordinal regression; Quality improvement","Cost reduction; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Productivity; Regression analysis; Work simplification; Company performance; Continuous improvements; Lean Six Sigma; Multiple correspondance analysis; Ordinal regression; Quality improvement; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078703503

Past research has found significant, robust impacts of hotter temperatures on reducing economic growth. While rainfall is important for agriculture, impacts on aggregate economic activity remain elusive. In this paper, I argue that rainfall is a poor indicator of water availability, particularly in urban contexts. Instead, I find that changes in water runoff significantly impact economic growth. Results show that years in which runoff is significantly lower than average, local economic activity growth is depressed. This impact is strongest in middle-income regions, where runoff 1 or 2 standard deviation below normal levels reduces GDP growth by 0.4–0.6% and 1.3–2.5%. I examine two mechanisms, agricultural production and hydropower dependence. Globally, agricultural production is depressed by below average runoff shocks, although the resulting impact on GDP is likely low. Regions which are more urban and rely more on hydropower production in their energy mix are significantly more sensitive to these runoff shocks. With climate change expected to increase the variability of water runoff, these shocks are expected to become more frequent in the future and in some regions may significantly hamper growth. © 2020","Economic growth; Hydropower; Night-time lights; Water supply","Agricultural robots; Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Climate change; Economic analysis; Hydroelectric power; Rain; Water supply; Agricultural productions; Economic activities; Economic growths; Hydro power production; Hydropower; Night time lights; Standard deviation; Water availability; Economic and social effects; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; economic activity; high temperature; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; nature-society relations; precipitation intensity; runoff; water availability; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082872703

However, very few studies have analysed attribute-ordering effects in DCEs, and no study has investigated their potential influence on information-processing strategies, such as attribute non-attendance (ANA). This paper tests for attribute-ordering effects and examines whether the order of attributes describing the alternatives affects respondents’ propensity to attend to or ignore an attribute. A split-sample approach is used, where one sample received a DCE version in which the positions of the first and last non-monetary attributes are switched across the sequence of choice tasks compared with the other sample. The results show that attribute order does not affect welfare estimates in a significant way under the standard assumption of full attribute attendance, thus rejecting the notion of procedural bias. However, the welfare estimates for the attributes whose order was reversed and the share of respondents who ignored them differ significantly between the two attribute-ordering treatments once ANA behaviour is accounted for in the estimated choice models. These results highlight the important role of information-processing strategies in the design and evaluation of DCEs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Attribute non-attendance; Convergent validity; Discrete choice experiment; Information processing; Ordering effects; Stated preferences","Data processing; Natural resources management; Attribute non-attendance; Convergent validity; Discrete choice experiments; Ordering effects; Stated preferences; Economics; discrete choice analysis; energy market; energy policy; information processing; model validation; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082446012

This paper contributes to an understanding of budget decision-making processes in agricultural development, by examining to what extent those with superior information and expertise on a sector have sway over how public resources to the sector are allocated. The empirical qualitative analysis of this paper employs process tracing with an embedded case study design, based on interviews of 79 senior public sector key-informants in Nigeria. We also analyzed quantitative public expenditure data in the study areas. We draw insights from theories of information asymmetries in the public sector along three dimensions. Within the first type of information asymmetry, we find that, despite the higher agricultural technical expertise that sector bureaucrats have vis-à-vis the elected non-sector-specific chief executives, it is the latter who heavily influence agricultural resource allocation. In the second form of information asymmetry, the benefits from superior lower-tier information are only exploited at one subnational (state) level but not at the other (local government) level. Within the third kind of information asymmetry, public leaders prioritize funding for those types of public investments that are more visible by their nature, and outputs of which materialize relatively rapidly; this disfavors agriculture. Going beyond the literature on the impact of information interventions, this study sheds light on the extent to which information already in the public sector is tapped into to guide the provision of public goods and services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Information asymmetries; Nigeria; Political economy factors in government resource allocation; Principal-agent model; Subnational public spending","agricultural development; agricultural production; decision making; econometrics; local government; numerical model; political economy; public spending; resource allocation; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078536292

This paper aims to alleviate some of the concerns as claimed in positioning and change agency theory by introducing “preferential role positioning” to organizational change. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative case study approach and change agency and positioning theories to find out the extent to which staff and management experienced the practical difficulties and challenges and what resolution actions they took. Eighty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2004/2005 and 2011 with the staff and management of four SMEs in the UK. An interpretative analysis was conducted on the case data in the tradition of Husserl and Schutz. In the first set, participants were asked to elucidate the difficulties faced in their roles and how these were experienced whilst the second focused on impacts and strategies. Three independent researchers reviewed and interpreted the qualitative data and helped with the coding and thematization. Findings: This paper's main results are based on the data's three stages showing how SME members chose to deal with the practical difficulties namely “new structures and procedures” (stage 1); “new ways of communicating” (stage 2) and “new collaborations” (stage 3). The combination of the stages' aspects led to the emergence of “preferential role positioning” as the study's theoretical contribution to the gap on preferences in organizational change research. Research limitations/implications: The eighty-five interviews from UK-based SMEs constrained the sample size thereby limiting the number of questionnaire categories asked. The findings and their analysis cannot be generalized to non-SMEs that seek to address similar difficulties. Practical implications: Managers need to be aware of the adverse impacts of using draconian, top-down disciplinary and punishment measures/structures as a way to implement change. Other practical lessons include the fact that managers should contextualize people's anxieties, dissatisfaction, resistance and disengagement as a platform from which social knowledge can be generated with all change agents in order to resolve implementation challenges in the longer term. Staff developed the ability to deal with some practical issues such as navigating through the new departmental structures, new working procedures and new ways of talking with management and with each other to implement change more successfully. Social implications: The social value of the findings demonstrates that preferences can be imported from other social science disciplines into Organizational Studies to show the value of what people can contribute and how they choose to do so (i.e. via what discourse, using what types of interactions and capabilities to do so). In addition, the results show that management need to consider employees in their plans as they try to implement change firstly to facilitate greater interaction and success, secondly to minimize implementation difficulties and thirdly as a recognition that there are multiple change agents and multiple role-enacting positions in developing sociological knowledge that can be of value. Originality/value: This study's three-stage approach has shown that a successful implementation and management of change in SMEs should also include a bottom-up recognition of the difficulties, adversities, conflicts and tensions and a resolution to deal with the structural and communicative constraints via dialogue and “preferential role positioning”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Management; Organizational change; Preferences; SMEs; Staff",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082597437

The study analyses young compulsive buyer attitudes, decision-making, product preferences, the impact of credit card use and post-purchase perspectives in relation to CBB severity. Design/methodology/approach: The study takes a quantitative approach to the analysis of compulsive behaviour among young consumers, using data from a questionnaire survey and a large sample. A wide range of statistical procedures and structural equation modelling are used in the analysis. Findings: The segmentation of compulsive buyers, on the basis of disorder severity, provides important insights into the asymmetrical between-group variation in anxiety levels, product preferences, feelings, attitudes and credit card impact and the within-group variability in daily compulsivity patterns and associated shopping behaviour. Research limitations/implications: Although the overall used sample size is large, the subdivision of compulsive consumers into mild and severe categories resulted in a relatively small group of severely compulsive buyers; hence, further research is recommended to corroborate the findings from this study. In addition, this research does not address the disorder’s temporal dimension; therefore, future longitudinal studies should be undertaken to analyse the progression and characteristics of the disorder over time. Practical implications: The significant differences between mild compulsive buyers and severely compulsive buyers make a significant contribution to counselling practitioners because of the different levels of support that should be offered in relation to the severity of the condition. Originality/value: The study compares non-compulsive behaviour with occasionally compulsive, mildly compulsive and severely compulsive consumers using an improved screening tool. It identifies critical criteria that distinguish between mild and severe forms of the disorder, which have hitherto been neglected, yet represent key diagnostic and predictive factors, which can inform both early intervention and our understanding of CBB and its complexity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Compulsive buying behavior; Credit cards; Decision making; Mildly compulsive; Severely compulsive",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077679307

Specifically, with rising vulnerability concerns associated with security and privacy breaches, patient use of OMR requires further attention. This paper aims to investigate patient use of OMR. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), factors affecting continued use of OMR were examined. Design/methodology/approach: The Health Information National Trends Survey 5 (HINTS 5), Cycle 1 data were used. This is an ongoing nation-wide survey sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA. The subjects were 31-74 years old with access to the Internet. Descriptive information was projected to the US population. Findings: In total, 765 respondents representing 48.7 million members of the US population were analyzed. Weighted regression results showed significant effects of perceived usefulness, visit frequency and provider encouragement on continued use of OMR while vulnerability perception was not significant. Moderating effects of these variables were also noted. Perceived usefulness and provider encouragement emerged as important predictors. Practical implications: Insights may help design interventions by health-care providers and policymakers. Social implications: Insights should help patient empowerment and developers with designing systems. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine health-care consumers’ continued use of OMR using nationally representative data and real-world patients, many of who have one or more chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, asthma) or are cancer survivors. Results highlight factors helping or hindering continuing OMR use.

Additionally, we demonstrate that, for family businesses with an increased family team complexity, the effect of bidder competition becomes weaker, whereas the relationship of PE expertise advantage on PE bargaining power becomes stronger. Hence, team complexity reduces a family business' decision power and increases a PE's comparative bargaining advantages. These findings contribute to several research streams: first, to that of family businesses by advancing knowledge on heterogeneity, operationalized as team complexity, that negatively affects a family business' bargaining power; second, to that on PE buyouts, with a finding that a PE firm's bargaining power differs significantly depending upon the type of seller (family vs. non-family business) due to a family business' unique socio-emotional wealth considerations; and third, to the general strategic management literature on upper echelons and top-management teams (TMT), with a finding that team complexity reduces the family business teams' behavioral integration and hence its ability to use potential bargaining advantages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Family business; PE buyout deals; Sources of bargaining power; Team complexity","Decision making; Human resource management; Investments; Behavioral integrations; Decision power; Family business; Strategic management; Team complexity; Time pressures; Top management teams; Upper echelons; Competition; bargaining; business; competition (economics); decision making; equity; private sector; social behavior; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082526734

Objective: This paper estimates the costs of mental health in Australia using the standard-of-living approach. Methods: The cost of mental illness was estimated implicitly using a standard-of-living approach. We analysed data from 16 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA) using 209,871 observations. Unobserved heterogeneity was mitigated using an extended random-effects estimator. Results: The equivalised disposable income of people with mental illness, measured by a self-reported mental health condition, needs to be 50% higher to achieve a similar living standard to those without a mental illness. The cost estimates vary considerably with measures of mental illness and standard of living. An alternative measure of mental illness using the first quintile of the SF-36 mental health score distribution resulted in an increase of estimated costs to 80% equivalised disposable income. Conclusion: People with mental illness need to increase equivalised disposable income, which includes existing financial supports, by 50–80% to achieve a similar level of financial satisfaction to those without a mental illness. The cost estimate can be substantially higher if the overall life satisfaction is used to proxy for standard of living. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"adult; Article; Australia; Australian; cost of illness; educational status; employment status; ethnicity; financial management; health care cost; health care policy; household; household income; human; life satisfaction; longitudinal study; major clinical study; marriage; mental disease; mental health; self report; Short Form 36; social status; cost; economics; health status; mental disease; prevalence; procedures; questionnaire; socioeconomics; Australia; Costs and Cost Analysis; Health Status; Humans; Mental Disorders; Prevalence; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076461578

These two questions have never been answered. The objective of this article is to examine the effect of the medium of exchange that US banks use on the consequent cost, revenue, and profit efficiencies of mergers and acquisitions for the period from 1992 to 2003. The results indicate that highly efficient acquirers lose less efficiency when using stocks in financing their acquisitions, while the least efficient acquirers only gain efficiency when mixing stocks with cash in financing their acquisitions. The distributional dynamics in the results of the acquirers’ post-merger profit efficiency show no changes in profit efficiency over time when banks use stock financing but trends towards efficiency loss when using pure cash financing and loses the most when mixing stocks with cash. The contribution of this article is a guideline on the characteristics of efficiency to decision-makers for selecting the medium of exchange in friendly acquisitions given the consequent changes in strategic efficiency after acquisitions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cost efficiency; data envelopment analysis; Method of payment; profit efficiency; revenue efficiency","banking; capital flow; cost-benefit analysis; econometrics; efficiency measurement; foreign direct investment; numerical model; profitability; stock market; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074365000

The call arrival process can be an arbitrary point process, allowing uncertainty and temporary surges in the arrival rate, provided that the system is stable. When a customer arrives, the call center manager examines the system state and decides whether to offer the incoming customer the callback option. When the callback option is offered, the customer decides whether to accept the offer. The customer is routed to the offline queue (to be called back later) only if he is offered the callback option and accepts it. Otherwise, he is routed to the online queue. For each customer in the online queue, the call center manager incurs a waiting cost of h per time unit. Similarly, whenever she routes a customer to the offline queue (for a callback later), she incurs a one-time penalty of p. Initially, we allow complete foresight policies that look into the entire future. We show that a simple lookahead policy that looks into the future arrivals and service completion times for the next p/h time units and uses the current number of customers in the system who previously rejected a callback offer (but does not look into the accept/reject decisions of future customers) is pathwise optimal. Building on the insights gleaned from the optimal lookahead policies, we also propose a nonanticipating (and implementable) policy by interpreting the lookahead policy in the fluid model and show that it is optimal in the fluid model. In particular, we show that this policy reduces to the so-called line policy, if the arrival rate process follows a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process. Last, we conduct a simulation study, which shows that the proposed policies perform well. © 2020 INFORMS.","Callback option; Pathwise analysis; Queueing system","Managers; Queueing theory; Arbitrary points; Arrival process; Arrival rates; Call centers; Completion time; Fluid modeling; Simulation studies; System state; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091652203

Therefore, it is paramount that the leadership and/or management team in an organization establishes and implements an approach that can effectively assess and evaluate the performance of its employees in an objective manner. Research administrators are often involved with the performance evaluation process at their respective institutions. However, there is a limited amount of publicly available information on the use of work performance and assessment methods in research settings. The primary aim of this pilot project was to establish a structured performance-based assessment tool that would allow for an objective and clearly articulated evaluation of staff performance at our clinical research center. The secondary aim was to determine if a structured performance-based assessment tool would improve staff satisfaction with the Center’s overall performance evaluation process (PEP). A baseline survey was conducted to examine employee perspectives of and satisfaction with the current performance evaluation process. A follow-up survey was conducted after the mid-year performance review period and implementation of the new PEP, including goals templates and performance evaluation guidance documents. The results of the baseline survey showed that staff had mixed reviews of the overall performance evaluation process (somewhat satisfied-33%, very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied-all 16%) and all thought the evaluation criteria could be improved (100%). The results of the follow-up survey showed that staff reviews of the overall mid-year performance evaluation process had improved (63% satisfied, 12% very satisfied, 25% somewhat satisfied) and that 50% of respondents were satisfied with the ease of use and clarity of the templates that were used to record their progress towards achieving their goals. Staff shared additional suggestions for strengthening and better aligning the templates with Center-specific roles and activities. Overall, the leadership/management team at our research Center was successful in creating a performance-based assessment approach that facilitated a more objective and clearly articulated evaluation of staff performance. There are numerous challenges to effectively evaluating staff performance in both research and non-research organizations. As a result, the strategies outlined here may be transferable to other types of work settings. © 2020, Society of Research Administrators International.

However, great variations exist among traders in the risk-taking tendency and the results for trading are opposite for profitable and unprofitable traders. For the unprofitable, more risk-taking by trading more actively leads to greater losses. This is concrete evidence for the prevailing belief in the literature that trading too much, arguably due to overconfidence, is hazardous to investor's wealth.

However, limited evidence exists about effects of these programmes for the organisations that sponsor them. A minority of healthcare systems in the USA measure the impact of these programmes on organisational metrics such as staff turnover or cost savings. This systematic review sought to answer the question,' What evidence exists that leadership and/or management development and training programs yield benefits for health care organizations?' These benefits could include return on investment, improved productivity/cohesion/teaming, or increased use of specific management skills (eg, strategic planning) that would directly benefit the organisation. Methods We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct a systematic review of the relevant literature. We conducted two searches in PubMed and one in ABI/Inform, a business literature database. All articles included for the study were further categorised according to their relevance for answering the research questions, using predefined criteria based on their methodology and reported findings. Results Our search included 2462 studies, of which 55 met criteria for inclusion. We identified four potential organisation-level benefits to leadership and management training programmes: Benefits to other staff (besides those who participate in the programmes), improved patient safety and satisfaction, tangible benefits from projects that were part of the programme and improved ability/confidence using leadership-related skills by programme participants. However, the research base on this topic is limited. Conclusion Although this research identified potential benefits of leadership and management programmes at the organisation level, additional research is needed to make definitive conclusions about their impact. © 2020 Author(s).","clinical leadership; competencies; improvement; management; medical leadership","adult; article; drug safety; female; health care organization; human; investment; leadership; male; Medline; meta analysis; patient safety; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; productivity; satisfaction; skill; strategic planning; systematic review; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079229205

The relative efficiency of hotel operations by the four regions was as follows: Eastern China > Central China > Western China > Northeastern China. The efficiency of hotels demonstrated differing coefficients of variation. The most significant coefficient of variation was for Western China, and the smallest was for Northeastern China. The primary cause of inefficiencies was in input redundancies, especially the high degree of input redundancy in number of hotels, employees, and rooms.

In this paper, we present a dynamic programming model to study how an online publisher should optimally allocate and price page views between guaranteed and spot markets. The problem is challenging because the allocation and pricing of guaranteed contracts affect how advertisers split their purchases between the two markets, and the terminal value of the model is endogenously determined by the updated dual force of supply and demand in auctions. We take the advertisers’ purchasing behaviour into consideration, i.e., risk aversion and stochastic demand arrivals, and present a scalable and efficient algorithm for the optimal solution. The model is also empirically validated with a commercial dataset.

These two systems are distinct and used in isolation by the decision-maker. On the contrary, the Uni-Process Model suggests an alignment between the two styles of thinking based on common rules and principles, meaning they are integrated into one decision-making process. The processes happen simultaneously, not independently. We subscribe to this logic and test these two judgments according to salespeople’s perception across three studies. First, we examine salespeople in the shoe industry, second salespeople working in the retail banking, and finally through a comprehensive meta-analysis. We investigate the effects of salespeople’s intuition, deliberation, and ‘intuition-deliberation alignment’ on sales performance through the mediating mechanism of acquisition-retention ambidexterity, finding effects across each context. While this does provide evidence that the two judgments may work well separately, it strongly supports the use of the Uni-Process Model to explain and predict sales outcomes. Specifically, while both intuitive and deliberate judgment isolate increase sales performance through salespeople’s ambidextrous behavior, the newly created intuitive-deliberative alignment construct suggests that sales performance is higher when salespeople’s intuitive and deliberative judgements are both high rather than when both are low, and this effect goes through A-R ambidexterity. © 2020 Pi Sigma Epsilon National Educational Foundation.","ambidexterity; deliberative; fit; Intuitive; meta-analysis; sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097631709

This involves the identification of critical success factors and challenges in the use of DoE in the context of the service industry as well as the key skills needed for its successful applications. Design/methodology/approach: In order to identify the critical success factors and challenges, an online survey instrument was developed and distributed across Six Sigma Black Belts (SSBB), Six Sigma Master Black Belts (SSMBB), process improvement champions, continuous improvement professionals, DoE experts and specialists as well as academics who are involved in DoE research and applications. Findings: A total of 109 participants from over 20 countries responded to the study. One of the first findings of the study is that over 40% of the process improvement professionals in the service sector do not have any hands-on experience with the application of DoE. Further, this study highlights the following critical factors for successful DoE applications: dedicating adequate resources in terms of time, budget and people for the experiment; getting a clear understanding of the problem at hand; securing a reliable and validated measurement system for measuring the response or quality characteristics of interest; and identifying input independent variables, which influence the quality characteristics during the brainstorming stage. Some respondents also mention the importance of having training or education in DoE as a critical success factor. At the same time, the lack of adequate planning to experimentation, mathematical knowledge and statistical reasoning remains as challenge to be solved. Research limitations/implications: As data were collected at an individual level, inter-reliability, which measures the consistency of judgements on a particular survey item, could not be gauged. Moreover, due to low sample size across some continents, an intercontinental comparative study on the extent of the application of DoE across various continents could not be performed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first global survey carried out to understand the status of DoE in the service industry. The results of the global study can be used to encourage quality, continuous improvement and process improvement professionals in the service sector to drive wider acceptance of one of the most powerful tools in the Six Sigma toolkit for problem-solving scenarios. Moreover, senior managers in the service industry can take away some of the key benefits, challenges and success factors in the implementation of DoE. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design of experiments; Global survey; Service industry","Belts; Budget control; Design of experiments; Digital storage; Enterprise resource planning; Manufacture; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Silicon; Six sigma; Surveys; Work simplification; Continuous improvements; Critical success factor; Design/methodology/approach; Independent variables; Mathematical knowledge; Non-manufacturing process; Quality characteristic; Research and application; Service industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092487148

The study covers 37 OECD countries. Design/methodology/approach: The Mundlak decomposition was employed to decompose the effect of public debt into its transitory and permanent effect on economic growth. To account for potential endogeneity problem, the Hausman and Taylor estimator was employed to estimate the decomposed model. Further, the study disaggregated the OECD model into country group models for further analysis of the dynamics of the relationship between the variables. Findings: The findings of the study reveal that in the full OECD model public debt exerts a significant negative permanent and positive transitory effect on economic growth. This was robust to alternative model specifications. The magnitude of the negative permanent effect of debt was found to be larger than the positive transitory effect. Further, the estimates of the disaggregated models reveal that though public debt has a negative permanent effect across all the country groups, it was not the case for the transitory effect of debt. Also, a net public debt model was estimated, and its effect on public debt was found to be largely insignificant, exhibiting a Ricardian-like behaviour.

Firm mobility and geographical mobility increase throughout the period examined, with only temporary reversals around the Great Depression and Second World War.

Specifically, one is simpler but with more options, and another is more complex but with fewer options. Moreover, we further discuss the impact of two methods on the relationship between financial literacy and risk attitude. The theoretical and empirical studies indicate that the respondents will be more risk-loving in the elicitation method with simpler and more options because of computation avoiding and noisy behaviours.

In that framework, it is generally expected that as trade openness increases, economic growth will follow the same trend because of innovation and productivity. Henceforth, establishing the contribution of trade openness to economic growth is of high priority, especially in the case of developing countries such as the Baltic ones. The current paper examines the causal relationship between trade openness and economic growth in the case of three Baltic countries for the period 1990-2020, using the recently developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) non-causal Granger test for heterogenous panel data. The findings of the current study suggested that there is a cross-sectional dependence on the model time series between the counties under investigation, which proved that Baltic countries have common factors and common economic links. The theoretical and empirical studies previously conducted, are useful starting points for the discussion on policies which could increase the development of Baltic countries. For the development to be increased, the developmental procedures in the Baltic countries should upload their “development chains”. Such transformation of the “development chains” will be achieved through investments in capital equipment, human capital and innovations by securing a favorable and stable economic climate. © 2020 AESS Publications.

Contrary to what the normative economic theory would predict, we document that consumers frequently failed to redeem their rebate. Given this observation, we examine what may have been the primary driving force behind this pattern and the implications for the firm. We provide evidence that the phenomenon that we observe in our study is a result of cardholders being influenced by the way their outcomes were framed. We find that redemption incidences coincide with episodes where rebates are a larger portion of the amount spent. On the basis of the empirical regularities, we formulate a model of cardholder behavior where the cardholder experiences increasing psychological utility when rebate redemption yields a deeper discount. The model estimates indicate that, although delayed redemption left customers monetarily worse off in each transaction (cardholders passed up on average 0.76 of cardlevel benefits to experience greater psychological utility), once the psychological utility is taken into account, customers were shown to fare better overall. For the firm, in addition to the card benefits that were passed up, the psychological utility generated an additional average benefit of 1.21 per redemption. Finally, through counterfactuals we show that carefully designing a rebate program that takes into account consumers' psychological redemption utility can further benefit both consumers and firms. © 2019 INFORMS.","Behavioral Biases; Behavioral Economics; Context Effect; Credit Card; Framing; Promotional Strategy; Rebate","Management; Operations research; Behavioral bias; Counterfactuals; Credit card industry; Driving forces; Economic theories; Empirical regularities; Model estimates; Rebate program; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082643831

The spatial Durbin production frontier model allows for the decomposition of direct and indirect (spillover) total factor productivity (TFP) growth, as well as the gross direct and indirect efficiency of the respective provinces. The estimated results show that spatial productivity and efficiency spillovers are positive and lead to higher productivity growth. On average, indirect effects provide an additional TFP growth of 3.1% and an additional efficiency spillover of 18.98%. However, the estimated results also show that TFP growth is declining over time and there is room for efficiency gains if persistent efficiency is increased.

Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) could offer a solution to meet this demand thanks to their estimated low capital costs, low operational risk, and promise of reliably dispatchable low-carbon electricity. In the published literature, there is little emphasis placed on estimating or modelling the future impact of MSRs on electricity grids. Previous modelling efforts were limited to quantifying the value of renewable energy sources, energy storage and carbon capture technologies. To date, no study has assessed or modelled MSRs as a competing power generation source for meeting decarbonization targets. Given this gap, the main objective of this paper is to explore the cost benefits for policy makers, consumers, and investors when MSRs are deployed between 2020 and 2050 for electricity generation in the UK. This paper presents results from electricity systems optimization (ESO) modelling of the costs associated with the deployment of 1350 MWe MSRs, from 2025 onwards to 2050, and compares this against a UK grid with no MSR deployment. Results illustrate a minimum economic benefit of £1.25 billion for every reactor installed over this time period. Additionally, an investment benefit occurs for a fleet of these reactors which have a combined net present value (NPV) of £22 billion in 2050 with a payback period of 23 years if electricity is sold competitively to consumers at a price of £60/MWh. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy system modelling; Molten salt reactor; Nuclear energy; Power generation","Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Fused salts; Investments; Molten salt reactor; Renewable energy resources; Risk perception; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Electricity system; Investment benefit; Low-carbon electricities; Low-carbon futures; Power generation sources; Renewable energy source; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089277671

We consider operational risk events as shocks to a financial firm's value process and then study capital investments under preventive and corrective controls to mitigate risk losses. The optimal decisions are made in three scenarios: (i) preventive control only, (ii) corrective control only, and (iii) joint controls. We characterize the optimal control policies within a general modeling framework that comprises these three scenarios and then discuss an exponential risk reduction function. We conclude our work with an application of our model to a data set from a commercial bank. We find that, through a proper investment strategy, we can achieve a significant performance improvement, especially when the risk severity level is high. Moreover, with controls, the value of the firm tends to increase relative to the value of the firm without controls. Hence, the controls are essentially smoothing out the jump losses and increasing the value of the firm. At the bank we analyze we find that with a joint control strategy the bank can achieve profit increases from 7.45% to 11.62% when the risk reduction efficiencies of the two controls are high. In general, our modeling framework, which combines a typical operational risk process with stochastic control, may suggest a new research direction in operations management and operational risk management.

However, because different subpopulations may respond differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We compare our approach with current practice by proving performance guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic distribution between targeted individuals and the study population. Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set, we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management. We find that our approach can offer significant benefits over common practice, particularly when the heterogeneity in patient response to the treatment is large. © 2020 INFORMS.","Analytics; Healthcare; Intervention effectiveness; Robust optimization","Decision making; Health insurance; Hospitals; Optimization; Demographic distributions; Emergency departments; Fairness constraints; Intervention effectiveness; Performance guarantees; Resource Constraint; Robust optimization; Structural differences; Patient treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095485879

They allow researchers to systematically vary choice attributes in a manner that can both increase estimation efficiency and allay endogeneity concerns. An increasing number of studies have included elicited subjective beliefs in their stated preference models. We discuss why this strategy may be warranted in some cases, specifically when the researcher suspects subjects will engage in attribute value substitution or scenario adjustment. While there are multiple ways one could integrate subjective beliefs, in all cases a proper understanding of the econometric ramifications of their inclusion is necessary. We show that excluding subjective beliefs yields biased parameter estimates yet policy-relevant welfare measures, whereas including subjective beliefs yields unbiased parameter estimates but can generate less policy-relevant welfare estimates. We demonstrate how policy-relevant welfare measures should be calculated from models that include subjective beliefs and illustrate our theory with an application to payment for ecosystem services to farmers. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Attribute value substitution; Discrete choice; Scenario adjustment; Subjective beliefs","Ecosystems; Parameter estimation; Attribute values; Choice experiments; Discrete choice experiments; Ecosystem services; Environmental economics; Parameter estimate; Stated preferences; Unintended consequences; Economics; discrete choice analysis; econometrics; economic policy; ecosystem service; environmental economics; marketing; transportation development; welfare provision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093855317

According to our analysis performed on the case, the demise of Carillion was the result of accumulation of failures and normalisation of deviations from good practice. The purpose of this study is to better understand how deviance can become the norm such that actors in the context of the construction organisations such as Carillion, come to adopt deviant practices rather than respecting their accepted industry codes and ethos. This study is based on an in-depth analysis of publicly available data on the case of Carillion. Our aim is to better understand the process of normalisation of deviance and its potential effect on organisations. Our analysis of the case revealed three specific types of normalised deviance: late payments to suppliers, aggressive accounting and payment of high dividends to shareholders despite the troubled financial status of the firm. The results of our work contribute to theory by showing that normalisation of deviance is a gradual process which can be influenced by actors both within the focal organisation as well as actors in its environment. The managerial implications highlight the need for all actors in the construction sector to become more aware of the normalising deviance process and its potential negative effects, which can be mitigated by stronger adherence to controls in the external environment in which the organisation operates. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Construction organisations; external actors; normalising deviance","Construction industry; Construction organisations; Construction projects; Construction sectors; External environments; In-depth analysis; Managerial implications; Potential effects; Potential negative effects; Taxation; construction industry; financial system; management; organization; safety; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089249440

GB coupon is available to parties of any size and the groups do not need to go together to the restaurants. Such restaurants serve two types of customers: GB customers with GB coupons and regular customers without coupons. One common practice for these restaurants is to set a maximum number of tables for each type of customer in advance and ask customers to wait in separate queues when all the tables for that customer type are occupied. As a result, restaurants are interested in finding optimal table allocation to serve the two types of customers to maximize profits. Since customers come follow a stochastic and discrete process, eat on a table that can be regarded as being served by a server in a queueing system, and wait in the queue when the restaurant is full, the dining process of customers and operating process of the restaurant is suitable to be described by queueing system. So, this study applies queueing theory to examine the table allocation problem. The effects of customer related parameters such as arrival rate and patience degree on the optimal allocation are discussed. The simulation model is extended to consider customers arriving in parties of different and serving tables of different sizes. We find that for a specific type of customer, if the arrival rate increases, the number of tables allocated for them increases. Patience degree has opposite influences on table allocation for the two types of customers: if regular customers are not patient, more tables should be allocated to them; while if GB customers are not patient, less tables should be allocated to them. If considering different customer party sizes and table sizes, as the arrival rate of regular customer increases, number of GB table decreases, number of tables for large (small) regular party first decreases (increases) and then increases (decreases). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Group buying; Queuing theory; Resource allocation; Restaurant","Group theory; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Stochastic systems; Advertizing; Arrival rates; Group buying; Operating process; Queueing system; Queuing theory; Regular customers; Resources allocation; Restaurant; Stochastics; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050199013

Under fixed pricing (or flat rate) contract, the patient is charged a fixed price for the healthcare services irrespective of the actual cost incurred by the hospital. Such contracts increase the risks for the healthcare service provider, thus making pricing decision crucial. In this paper, we study uncertainty and analyse the flat rate pricing contract for a profit maximising hospital to find the optimal price of treatment and examined value-at-risk (VaR) associated with such contracts for a risk minimising hospital. Bounds on price were derived to support healthcare providers with price negotiations. We extended the basic models by adding constraints to obtain risk-adjusted optimal price. We proved analytically that the optimal price lies between profit maximisation value and risk minimisation value of price, which we refer to as the efficient pricing interval. Our models and insights provide practical support to private healthcare service providers for optimal pricing and keep them informed about their risk position. © 2019 The Author(s).

The design of equity split agreements has attracted considerable attention in the entrepreneurial community, with no convergence on a single preferred contract form. This paper experimentally examines the effectiveness of different contractual arrangements, focusing in particular on the effects of contract form and contracting timing on founder effort and on the value of the venture. Our results suggest that performance improves with the incentive strength of the contract, but they question the conventional logic that this effect is causal. Instead, we suggest a novel causal sequence. Rather than the contract form being the primitive and the behavior the derived consequence, our results suggest the reverse. The differences in contract performance are driven primarily by the sorting of high contributors into nonequal contracts and of low contributors into equal contracts; that is, equal contracts are bad for team performance not because of their incentive strength but because of the founder types that adopt them. Taken together, these results suggest that both investors and founders should pay as much (or more) attention to personality type as they do to contract form. © 2019 INFORMS.","Behavioral operations; Contracting; Entrepreneurial operations; Innovation; Start-ups","Operations research; Contract performance; Contractual arrangements; Incentive design; Personality types; Team performance; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092348284

Specifically, the value of an experience is also determined by the concurrent (during-the-experience) cognitive assessment of the event relative to the person's associated goal progress/regression. CEE can account for during-the-experience and subsequent choices that people make. Examples of CEE include cognitive evaluations that enhance the experience value such as “good for me” (while eating kale), “I'm getting my money's worth” (while using a new camera), and “I'm having a cultural experience” (while visiting a museum), or detract from the experience such as “I shouldn't be doing this” (while smoking or overeating) and “should have chosen the other line” (while waiting at the supermarket checkout). Although prior research has examined hedonic experiences and their context (e.g., being with friends, commuting, colonoscopy) as well as what else the mind may process during an experience (e.g., wandering, thinking of past and future decisions), the concurrent value derived from the cognitive evaluation of the goal implications of an experience has not been identified as a separate experience value component. I examine and illustrate the CEE concept, its determinants, moderators, and implications, as well as its distinctive characteristics as compared with other value perspectives and during-the-experience mental processes. Integrating the CEE framework with prior work regarding experience evaluations, I outline a program for future CEE research. © 2020 Society for Consumer Psychology","Behavioral decision theory; Decision making; Economic psychology; Hedonic and experiential consumption; Judgment; Meta-cognition and metacognitive experience; Preference and choice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089996128

Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","Research Summary: Scholars regularly use multipoint contact (MPC) to explain how encountering rivals in different domains shapes performance. While most explanations rely on mutual forbearance theory, I propose that competitive deterrence does not adequately explain how MPC shapes performance in knowledge intensive work and argue instead that cross-domain synergies may play a central role. I examine how security analysts' MPC with publicly traded firms captures synergies in their coverage portfolio, which improves forecasting accuracy and information leadership. The advantages of greater MPC for a focal analyst are counterbalanced by rivals' observational learning, which reduces the focal analyst's forecasting differentiation. A natural experiment helps corroborate my argument: rival analysts' forecasting accuracy dropped for firms in which high MPC analysts perished in the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Managerial Summary: Competition in the knowledge economy often unfolds across multiple domains including product markets, geographic locations, and customer segments. In these settings, an actor's level of multipoint contact (MPC) in a domain captures the knowledge and other synergies available to the focal actor, which can improve performance in the domain. In the equity research setting, an analyst's MPC on a focal firm captures the likelihood that the analyst also covers that firm's suppliers, customers and important competitors. Using data on analysts' forecasting performance between 2001 and 2013, I find that greater levels of MPC on a focal firm predicts greater forecasting accuracy and information leadership but also lowers forecasting differentiation by attracting rivals who observe and benefit from the focal analyst's knowledge. © 2020 The Authors.

Using Census microdata on the population of U.S. hotels from 1987-2007, we find that doubling the intensity of internal agglomeration is associated with a productivity increase of about 2% in pre-existing establishments. We consider several mechanisms that may be driving the productivity effect and find evidence consistent with the idea that an economically meaningful component of the productivity effect is due to knowledge transfer between internally agglomerated establishments. We replicate our main findings with Census microdata on the full population of U.S. restaurants from 1987-2007, suggesting that the internal agglomeration effects we document may generalize broadly to other industries with multi-unit firms.

Yet despite the availability of various communication methods, data exchange between co-located devices is often complicated by technical and user experience barriers. A potential solution to these issues is the emerging technology of device-to-device acoustic data transmission. In this work, we investigate the medium-specific properties of sound as a data exchange mechanism, and question how these contribute to the user experience of sharing data. We present a user study comparing three wireless communication technologies (acoustic data transmission, QR codes and Bluetooth), when used for a common and familiar scenario: peer-to-peer sharing of contact information. Overall, the results show that acoustic data transmission provides a rapid means of transferring data (mean transaction time of 2.4 s), in contrast to Bluetooth (8.3 s) and QR (6.3 s), whilst requiring minimal physical effort and user coordination. All QR code transactions were successful on the first attempt; however, some acoustic (5.6%) and Bluetooth (16.7%) transactions required multiple attempts to successfully share a contact. Participants also provided feedback on their user experience via surveys and semi-structured interviews. Perceived transaction time, physical effort, and connectivity issues. Specifically, users expressed frustration with Bluetooth due to device selection issues, and with QR for the physical coordination required to scan codes. The findings indicate that acoustic data transmission has unique advantages in facilitating information sharing and interaction between co-located users. © 2019, The Author(s).","Acoustic data transmission; Audio; Mobile; Peer-to-peer connectivity; User experience; Wireless data transfer","Audio acoustics; Bluetooth; Data transfer; Electronic data interchange; Information dissemination; Surveys; Acoustic data transmissions; Audio; Mobile; Peer-to-peer connectivity; User experience; Wireless data transfer; Codes (symbols)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077370151

However, the quality and trustworthiness of the indicators depend on the constant improvement in the means to assess and design criteria sets. The identification of criteria to evaluate indicators and its subsequence selection are not an ordinary task. The research identified a proliferation of unconsolidated criteria in use in the sustainability and water resource management domains. In response, a process of synthesis and consolidation was undertaken in order to reduce the level of redundancies and to identify possible candidates for “core criteria” that are identified as being a relevant part of most evaluation frameworks. A representative collection of sources from the specialized literature was screened for evaluation criteria. Altogether, 74 sources were assessed, comprising 346 mentions of criteria applied for indicator assessment. A detailed synthesis was performed to organize the criteria and identify possible redundancies. The analysis allowed a reduction from the 346 initial criteria to 60 unique criteria. The study offers a standard title and description for each criterion, contributing to improve clarity and avoid ambiguity. The criteria were also ranked to identify which criteria were in more systemic use. Of the 60 criteria found, the 12 most cited were identified as possible core criteria for framework development. Also, in order to facilitate the design of indicator sets, all 60 criteria were divided into two approaches (scientific/top-down or end-use/bottom-up). This study identified significant redundancies and a lack of standardization in the use of criteria, and it also ranked criteria to facilitate multi-method framework development. Thus, it is essential that indicator designers not only consider criteria that have some level of standardization to be able to compare and communicate with other agencies and communities but also consider how to utilize core criteria in the design of indicator sets. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Criteria; Indicator; Selection; Standardization; Synthesis; Top-down and bottom-up approach","decision making; natural resource; resource management; sustainability; water industry; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074605004

Our econometric approach enables us to disentangle the observable direct and indirect effects of truancy and test scores on the risk of unemployment or ‘Not in Education, Employment or Training’ (NEET) from their unobserved effects. Using data for England and Wales, we show that models of youth unemployment and NEET that ignore the correlation between the unobservable determinants of test scores and truancy will lead to misleading inference about the strength of their effects.

When and how do server-level quality metrics differ from customer-experienced ones? Can people properly account for these differences, or do they drive human judgment and decision biases? Academic/practical relevance: Biased judgments about service quality can cause governments to fund programs suboptimally, organizations to promote the wrong employees, and customers to make disappointing purchases. We further our understanding of the role that cognitive biases play in services and how to manage quality information in light of them. Methodology: We use a mathematical model to define the gap between server-level and customer-experienced quality metrics. We use secondary data in the context of the higher-education industry to quantify the customer-server quality gap in practice. We construct a behavioral model to derive hypotheses about how environmental factors impact the direction and magnitude of judgment biases. Controlled laboratory experiments test the hypothesized biases and mitigation techniques. Results:Our empirical study reveals that the twomeasures differ enough to drive significant differences in the rank order of school majors, teachers, and airports. Our experiments support our main conjecture that judgments and decisions about customerexperienced metrics are biased toward server-level metrics. Consequently, (1) judgments about customer-experienced quality are biased high/low when quality and server load are negatively/positively correlated, (2) judgments about a server's absolute impact on customer experience are biased high/low when a server has a smaller/larger load than average, and (3) providing customer-experienced quality metrics mitigate these biases. Managerial implications: Our results help identify when and why service-quality metrics are likely to mislead judgments and bias decisions as well as who is likely to benefit fromsuch biases. The results also guide system designers on how to report metrics when seeking to help support effective decision making.

The objective coefficient vectors of said problem, which are unobserved before implementation, vary from period to period. These vectors, however, are known to be random draws from an initially unknown distribution with known range. By implementing different solutions, the decision maker extracts information about the underlying distribution but at the same time experiences the cost associated with said solutions. We show that resolving the implied exploration versus exploitation tradeoff efficiently is related to solving a lower-bound problem (LBP), which simultaneously answers the questions of what to explore and how to do so. We establish a fundamental limit on the asymptotic performance of any admissible policy that is proportional to the optimal objective value of the LBP problem. We show that such a lower bound might be asymptotically attained by policies that adaptively reconstruct and solve the LBP at an exponentially decreasing frequency. Because the LBP is likely intractable in practice, we propose policies that instead reconstruct and solve a proxy for the LBP, which we call the optimality cover problem (OCP). We provide strong evidence of the practical tractability of the OCP, which implies that the proposed policies can be implemented in real time. We test the performance of the proposed policies through extensive numerical experiments, and we show that they significantly outperform relevant benchmarks in the long-term and are competitive in the short-term.

We examine, in this study, whether prediction markets are immune to such bias in estimating event probability.

However, the extant literature has not considered plural-sourcing firms which can bring work back in-house. In this paper, we develop a governance framework in which buyers engage in a comparative assessment of the costs associated with different sourcing modes following supplier employee mobility. Due to the imperfect transferability of social capital and associated uncertainty, buyers face increased contracting costs when supplier employees move. This prompts plural-sourcing buyers to increase their reliance on insourcing when the costs of adjusting in-house capacity are relatively low and when the costs of switching to alternative suppliers are relatively high. The analysis of data on patent prosecution activities and patent attorney mobility provides support to our theory. Managerial summary: This study provides a decision framework for buyer firms when their suppliers experience employee departures. Buyers may choose to (a) stay with the suppliers suffering employee losses or (b) follow mobile employees to their new suppliers. However, in both cases contracting becomes more difficult due to the disruption in supplier relationships or the need to work with new suppliers. There is a third option (c) though which is to bring work in-house. We explain that buyers opt for option (c) when it is easy to expand in-house capacity and when the costs of switching to alternative suppliers already in use are relatively high. Thus, supplier employee mobility may lead buyer firms to adjust their reliance on outsourcing even when there are no buyer employee departures. © 2020 The Authors.

The first two as how likely are college football season ticket holders to recommend (1) purchasing a similar season ticket package and (2) attending a home football game, to a friend or colleague. The third question examines if there is a difference between advocacy toward purchasing season tickets as compared to advocacy toward game attendance. Finally, we identify what factors impact advocacy for college football season ticket holders. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of 57,240 season ticket holders from 69 different National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision programs was undertaken. The data were analyzed to build a model of the drivers of advocacy in season ticket holders from a conceptual base of advocacy, trust and loyalty. Findings: The identified drivers include both institutionally influenced factors and factors related to season ticket holder behaviors/demographics. The season ticket holder is arguably the highest level of fan for any sports organization from an affinity perspective and clearly the most important from a business perspective. This research argues that the season ticket holder should not only be the focus of ticket sales efforts but also leveraged as marketing advocates with the objective of attracting additional fans.

However, guidelines for routine screening are contentious for many disorders and often fluctuate over time. Some tests are over- or underused compared to available evidence that justifies their use, with clinical practice persistently deviating from evidence-based guidelines. Here we develop an integrated, broad boundary feedback theory and formal model to explain the dynamics of routine population screening including fluctuations in policy-decision thresholds and the expansion of selection criteria which may lead to inappropriate use. We present a behaviorally realistic, boundedly rational model of detection and selection for medical screening that explains the potential of endogenous oscillations in practice guidelines as decision-makers—including epidemiologists, clinicians, and patients, or policymakers from guideline issuing organizations, perceive harms and benefits from potential outcomes and make trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity by altering the existing guidelines and actual practice. The model endogenously generates fluctuations in screening indications, test thresholds, test efficiency, and the target screening population, leading to long periods during which practice guidelines are suboptimal even if the underlying evidence base is constant.

Many industries implemented work from home (WFH) policies for all employees. For the defense industry, this became particularly challenging. The industry is an 'essential' function, and there was genuine concern for employee and community safety. Two streams are presented: (i) what decision-making changes were made across operational, tactical, and strategic circumstances, and (ii) how that affected the productivity and employee satisfaction. Using observational data, we examine what are the manifestation, consequence, and mitigation, through engineering employee and managerial level adjustments, in project and portfolio management business decision-making during this WFH period. We also present data from a qualitative survey related to how this affected productivity and employee sentiment. The findings show that the defense industry was unprepared for such an event. Productivity issues in operational decision-making, required line-management decision makers to be on-site. The lack of adequate team-sharing tools, especially for classified content, adversely affected productivity associated with tactical decision-making. Strategic decision-making was hampered by the industry's cultural preference for face-to-face meetings. Furthermore, we found that, as the WFH continued, employees showed a greater preference for continuing to work off-site. The article summarizes observed mitigation strategies to maintain productivity levels. © 1973-2011 IEEE.","Covid-19; decision-making; defense industry","Network security; Personnel; Productivity; Project management; Employee satisfaction; Face-to-face meetings; Management decision-making; Management decisions; Operational decision making; Qualitative surveys; Strategic decision making; Tactical decision makings; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090221568

A major part of providing airport security is implementing check points where passengers interface with the security screening system. The airlines and airport security administration receive negative publicity when passengers are mistreated at security check points. Further, these organizations spend a lot of time to assess the situation and take corrective actions. This study examines passenger perceived bias and the airport security screening system. Using data from a randomly selected sample of 145 airline passengers, six hypotheses are tested. The hypotheses exam the predictive relationships of control procedures, security personnel training, security personnel professionalism, and security screening systems on passenger perceived bias. Multiple regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses. The research findings indicate that security personnel professionalism is negatively and significantly related to passenger perceived bias.

In order to maintain a steady, adequate, and sustainable supply of minerals it is important that appropriate policies exist at all levels of government. Sufficient information must be available to inform the land-use planning process and the development of minerals supply strategies. An important first stage for improving the security of supply of minerals is to identify the locations of a country's mineral resources and estimate the quantities that may be present. Whilst the existence of resources does not mean that they will be extracted, knowing what minerals can be found within a jurisdiction can facilitate the development of strategies for their sustainable management, and to inform the negotiation of trade relationships. The study presented here, undertaken within the framework of a project funded by the European Union, attempted to produce a dataset for all non-energy mineral (i.e. excluding fossils fuel and uranium) resources and reserves in the UK. For the UK and many other countries there is no statutory requirement for the compilation of mineral resource or reserve data and consequently this information is either absent or contained within a range of disparate sources. This paper presents a methodology for collating available data in a consistent way and for filling data gaps. The results show that it is feasible, for relevant organisations such as national geological surveys, to compile new and relevant data for minerals by using a combination of disparate sources such as legacy data, modern industry data and spatial analysis. This methodology is also applicable to other nations with similar situations to the UK regarding minerals data. The resultant inventory shows the UK is relatively well endowed with a wide range of mineral resources and has large quantities of certain minerals. However, resources of some minerals, on which many industrial and manufacturing processes rely, are either absent or unrecorded, particularly many metals that are required for new technologies. This study also identifies the challenges involved in compiling national mineral resource and reserve totals. Most significant are the large uncertainties, the assumptions required and the variety of codes and standards that exist for reporting resources and reserves data. Nevertheless, a new dataset for the UK's mineral resources and reserves is presented. This may encourage long-term quantitative systematic monitoring of resources and reserves at a national scale to provide a basis for the development of minerals policy, environmental protection policy and business strategy. © 2020",,"Economics; Land use; Minerals; Planning; Sustainable development; Business strategy; Codes and standards; Land Use Planning; Manufacturing process; Minerals policies; Multiple currents; Security of supply; Sustainable management; Mineral resources; data set; economic growth; mineral exploration; mineral resource; quality of life; sustainability; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081671506

Each station serves at most one job at a time and there is a finite buffer between the two stations. We consider two flexible servers that are cross-trained to work at both stations. The duration for a server to finish a job at a station is exponentially distributed with a rate that depends on the server, the station, and the job. Our goal is to identify an efficient policy to dynamically assign the servers to the stations such that the expected makespan (duration to complete all the jobs) is minimized. Given that an optimal policy is non-idling, we focus on non-idling policies. We first derive the expected makespan of a general non-idling policy. We then analyze three simple non-idling policies: the summation-myopic, the product-myopic, and the teamwork policies. We prove that (i) the product-myopic policy is optimal if the servers maintain the same service-rate ratio at each station for all the jobs, (ii) the teamwork policy is optimal if the servers maintain the same service-rate ratio at different stations for jobs that are sequenced near each other, and (iii) the summation-myopic policy is no worse than the teamwork policy. Our numerical study based on general service rates suggests that the summation-myopic policy can be better or worse than the product-myopic policy.

One topic that has drawn extensive attention is whether the investment reform improved R&D productivity in China. Using a unique panel dataset from 160 universities, this paper examines the effect of the investment reform on productivity improvement in China’s agricultural biotechnology sector. We use a panel count data model with a dynamic feedback mechanism to model the knowledge production process. Strong evidence indicates that the investment reform greatly contributes to knowledge output production in China’s agricultural biotechnology sector. We also find that the input quality is more important than the absolute quantity; human research capacity exhibits the greatest contribution to the output of patents; past knowledge accumulation helps produce more patents; and entry barriers to patent production exist in China’s agricultural biotechnology sector. Moreover, the patent explosion in China may have been largely caused by improvements in the human capital input quality. © 2019 The Agricultural Economics Society","Agricultural biotechnology; dynamic feedback; human capital; investment reform; patents; research and development; research input quantity and quality","agricultural technology; biotechnology; human capital; investment; panel data; productivity; research and development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074821362

Design/methodology/approach: The literature is analysed with a scoping study and a systematic literature review. Productivity measurement approaches are compared using data at the product level. Findings: The definition of total factor productivity (TFP) in the literature negatively affects the accuracy of profitability and productivity measurement. In the usual case of a dynamic output mix, TFP change encompasses biasing output mix effects relating to profitability, but not to productivity change. Therefore, this paper defines changes of a ratio of output quantities to input quantities not as TFP change, but as quantitative profitability (QP) change. A framework is proposed decomposing profitability change into price recovery and QP change, whereas the latter comprises of valid productivity change (encompassing technological, technical efficiency and productivity-related scale effects) and output mix change (encompassing proportion, quality, output switching and profitability-related scale effects). Research limitations/implications: Future research should include literature from the industrial organisation field of economics. The presented framework should be transferred to the standard production function framework used in economics. Practical implications: The paper can help preventing faulty decision making or distrust due to the use of biased profitability or productivity indicators. TFP-based productivity indicators are unsuitable for most firms. To measure productivity meaningfully, firms should use adequate approaches (e.g. standard input- or adjusted total factor productivity-based ones). Originality/value: The paper contributes to a more accurate performance measurement approach, as researchers and practitioners better understand the components of profitability and productivity change. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Output mix; Performance measurement; Productivity; Profitability; Total factor productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072115703

Using a sample of 45 industries in 43 cities, the authors examined the employment impact of property tax abatement incentives. Property tax abatement incentives were positively associated with employment growth, but only in the early years when the abatement policies were still new. The authors also explored heterogeneity in these results among industries.

Taking into account the transitioning economy context, I further exploit the gradual and spatially uneven implementation of market-oriented reforms to track the relative importance of firms' absorptive capacity for economic catch-up. The three main results are as follows. First, firms exhibit higher productivity when located in an area with a denser network of related activities, particularly for firms with higher absorptive capacity. Second, the sources of the productivity gains are driven by externalities that arise from better access to inputs, similar workers and technological-related knowledge spillovers. Third, the role of absorptive capacity becomes more important for boosting productivity following more versus less intensive market-oriented economic reforms. These findings have important policy implications for transitioning economies and suggest that market reforms promote efficiency improvements related to performing actual R&D as well as encourage firms to seek out external sources of knowledge in order to attain market competitiveness. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The goal of the evaluation was to assess library performance for both formative and summative purposes by addressing evaluation questions on areas such as library services, use, and operations. Building upon the literature review of how mixed-methods approaches can contribute to library evaluation, the aim of this article is to show how a mixed-methods evaluation can be designed to examine multi-faceted library performance and to illustrate how the evaluation design allows information complementarity and can be utilized to present diverse viewpoints of the above three perspectives.

Many voluntary practices for mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture provide external benefits while lowering productivity. Policy analysis of the productivity consequences is complicated by the fact that decision makers can choose their own policy levers, an action that ruins any notion of random assignment. We introduce an identification strategy to correct this kind of endogeneity, combining classic methods from stochastic frontier analysis and selection models. Applying it to micro-level data from Finnish grain farms, we find that more efficient producers are more likely to enroll in subsidized practices. And, because those practices tend to reduce yield, frontier analysis without the endogeneity correction greatly understates the productivity loss. In other words, naïvely basing the frontier estimator on the subset of less-productive farms leads to downward bias in the frontier estimates. In fact, average inefficiency more than doubles after the correction in this case. An outlier investigation suggests that the lowest decile of farms are responsible for most of the selection bias in the uncorrected model. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agri-environmental policy; C34; C36; C54; D24; Endogeneity; Productivity; Q12; Q18; Q53; Q58; Selection model; Stochastic frontier analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075353873

While previous investment paradigms considered the economic implications of expanding or maintaining assets versus the alternative of no expansion or no maintenance, disinvestment considers whether it is realistic to attempt to maintain all assets according to their original standards, or if performance standards should be changed or ownership transferred. While the concept of disinvestment has received attention in recent years, there is no established framework for disinvestment actions, potential travel impacts associated with disinvestment actions have not been widely examined, and it is unclear how disinvestment may affect socially vulnerable populations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to guide disinvestment decisions. The framework identifies different disinvestment actions and illustrates the savings, costs, and control tradeoffs associated with those actions. Each action offers different cost-savings and is associated with varying levels of reduced responsibility or obligation. We next introduce a measure of social vulnerability referred to as the Disinvestment Vulnerability Index (DVI) to help identify socially vulnerable populations impacted by disinvestment. We then propose a methodology for identifying a set of least critical or “non-essential” roadway assets as initial candidates for disinvestment, and introduce an approach for quantifying the potential effect of asset-specific disinvestment actions on vulnerable populations. The suggested approach allows decision-makers to “take the first step” in selecting an initial set of potential disinvestment candidates by identifying assets that have a minimal disruptive effect on network-wide travel, while simultaneously considering accessibility and mobility issues related to socially vulnerable populations. We illustrate the approach in the state of Vermont using the state's travel demand model and data obtained from the U.S. Census. © 2019",,"Decision making; Economic and social effects; Motor transportation; Disruptive effects; Economic implications; Performance standards; Roadway infrastructure; Social vulnerability; Transportation infrastructures; Travel demand modeling; Vulnerability index; Investments; decision making; strategic approach; trade-off; transportation development; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; travel behavior; vulnerability; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076257400

In most operations management models, the demand quantity of a product is formulated as a function of price, which garners the company flexibility to obtain tradeoff between revenue and cost. Such a price-demand function may not be suitable for make-to-order products with heterogeneous demands. To address such an issue, we study the price quotation and scheduling problem for a set of order inquiries. Specifically, a manufacturer receives multiple order inquiries from customers, and needs to quote a price for each inquiry. The quoted price will affect the probability of which the customer will accept the price and confirm the order. Then the manufacturer determines a schedule for processing the confirmed orders. The objective of the manufacturer is to maximize the expected profit, i.e., the total revenue from all confirmed orders less the delay penalty incurred by some orders. We show that the problem is NP-hard, design a heuristic to determine price quotes, and propose a method to find an upper bound of the optimal objective value. The efficiency of our heuristic is evaluated computationally. In general, our heuristic performs weaker with tighter due date, greater scheduling cost relative to order price, and nonlinear relationship between price quote and order placement probability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coordination; Due date; Price quotation; Scheduling","Economics; Functions; Heuristic methods; Manufacture; Scheduling; Coordination; Due dates; Expected profits; Heterogeneous demand; Non-linear relationships; Operations management; Price quotation; Scheduling problem; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070675410

Accordingly, most DEA models include endogenous variables and need an additional step to find the influence of exogenous variables on the process. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the efficiency scores of DEA and the exogenous variables using truncated regression analysis with double bootstrapping along with two additional methods. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors employ DEA for benchmarking the comparative efficiency of the health care institutes. Next, the authors run and compare truncated, ordinary least square (OLS) and Tobit regression analysis using the double bootstrapping algorithm for finding the influence of exogenous variables on the efficiency of the health care institutes. Findings: The authors confirmed the amount of bias for the Tobit and OLS regression models, which was caused by serially correlated errors. Accordingly, the authors chose results from the truncated regression model with double bootstrapping for examining the influence of exogenous or environment variables on the efficiency scores. Research limitations/implications: The study includes cross-sectional data on health care institutes in the state of Washington, USA. Collecting data in various states or regions over time is left for future studies. Practical implications: In this study, three exogenous variables such as Medicaid revenues, locations of health care institutes and ownership types are significant for explaining the relationship between the efficiency scores and a group of the exogenous variables. Managers and policy makers need to pay attention to these variables along with endogenous variables for promoting the sustainability of the health care institutes. Originality/value: The study demonstrates the usefulness of the truncated regression analysis with double bootstrapping for confirming the relationship between the efficiency scores of DEA and a group of exogenous variables, which is rare in the DEA literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; Health services; Performance measurement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076841822

GDP growth has been in the double digits on average yearly, creating the fastest sustained economic growth recorded by a major economy in history. Not only did this transform the economy and society at large, China reached important milestones in terms of reducing poverty and creating prosperity in a short period of time. This article uses the conceptual framework of new institutional economics to examine China’s economic growth and how growth has been achieved largely by ‘informal institutions’ that are grounded in culture, customs, and private interactions that emerge spontaneously. The trajectory by which these informal institutions left their imprint on China’s complex economic landscape and how they can constrain future economic growth are also of central importance. After examining decentralization and risk management practices, property rights, and the legal system, we emphasize the importance of creating formal institutions necessary for long-term growth, most importantly innovation.

The principle of Pasteur’s quadrant is used to realize a highly practical solution, which extends the existing wisdom on leagile continuous planning. This study compares the accuracy of the proposed Bayesian approach with the traditional approach using real data. The results suggest that the evolving Bayesian baselines can generate a more realistic measure of performance than traditional baselines, enabling leagile projects and portfolios to be better managed in the continuously changing environments of today. © 2020, SciKA.","Continuous planning/learning; Decision making; Evolving Bayesian baselines; Leagile project portfolio; Performance measurement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103055146

The new procedure overcomes the challenge of tuning parameter selection of Lasso and possesses several appealing properties. It uses an easily simulated tuning parameter that automatically adapts to both the unknown random error distribution and the correlation structure of the design matrix. It is robust with substantial efficiency gain for heavy-tailed random errors while maintaining high efficiency for normal random errors. Comparing with other alternative robust regression procedures, it also enjoys the property of being equivariant when the response variable undergoes a scale transformation. Computationally, it can be efficiently solved via linear programming. Theoretically, under weak conditions on the random error distribution, we establish a finite-sample error bound with a near-oracle rate for the new estimator with the simulated tuning parameter. Our results make useful contributions to mending the gap between the practice and theory of Lasso and its variants. We also prove that further improvement in efficiency can be achieved by a second-stage enhancement with some light tuning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods often outperform cross-validated Lasso in various settings. © 2020 American Statistical Association.","Efficiency; Heavy-tailed error; High dimension; Linear regression; Robustness; Tuning parameter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097763077

In this study we provide new evidence showing that oil price volatility does not improve forecasts of agricultural price volatility. This finding is based on extensive and rigorous testing of five internationally traded agricultural commodities (soybeans, corn, sugar, rough rice and wheat) and two oil benchmarks (Brent and WTI). We employ monthly and daily oil and food price volatility data and two forecasting frameworks, namely, the HAR and MIDAS-HAR, for the period 2nd January 1990 until 31st March 2017. Results indicate that oil volatility-enhanced HAR or MIDAS-HAR models cannot systematically outperform the standard HAR model. Thus, contrary to what has been suggested by the existing literature based on in-sample analysis, we are unable to find any systematic evidence that oil price volatility improves out-of-sample forecasts of food price volatility. The results remain robust to the choice of different out-of-sample forecasting periods and three different volatility measures. Copyright © 2021 by the IAEE.

In that sense, the methodology models the coefficients as a stochastic function of multiple structural characteristics. The findings document that gross domestic product growth increases after a positive electricity supply shock, regardless of the source of energy that generates it. The absence of a sluggish adjust-ment mechanism may reflect weak competition and significant market power by the incumbents in the electricity industry.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from supplier development theories and practices in the manufacturing sector, a mixed interpretivist and empirical methodology is adopted to examine the body of knowledge within literature for conceptual model development. A self-reporting survey questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale is used to assess 30 construction professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of 37 SC development practices classified into five categories. Descriptive statistics, weighted means, and t-tests are used for data analysis. Findings: SC prequalification, commitment, incentives, evaluation and feedback practices can be effective in generating high-performing SCs.

We investigate the economic value of this app and how drivers build an initial preference for passenger matching, the cancellation feature, and online pay as well as how a two-sided sales promotion affects drivers' willingness to use the TNC app. We estimate a structural model of drivers' decisions to accept orders and to cancel generated orders and their perception of passengers' willingness to utilize a sales promotion. Bayesian learning processes are introduced to account for drivers' learning new features. We find evidence of the economic value of new features on a TNC app and drivers' learning about the value of those features. Our results show that a platform subsidy and bids from passengers might signal low quality of service, and that platform cashback to passengers has a positive effect on drivers by increasing drivers' chances of being rewarded. Our results further indicate that the substantial value of early promotion not only encourages current usage but also fosters learning that sustains drivers' continued use of the app, and show how cashback for passengers affects the decisions of drivers. Finally, our policy simulations show improved performance with regard to drivers' willingness to use the app as well as its cost effectiveness. © 2020 INFORMS.","Bayesian learning; Structural model; Transportation network companies; Two-sided sales promotion","Cost effectiveness; Quality of service; Sales; Taxicabs; Bayesian learning; Business modeling; Continued use; Economic values; Policy simulation; Sales promotions; Structural modeling; Transportation network; E-learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092919262

In either class of models, predictive measurements of productivity and efficiency are obtained. The different approaches to productivity and efficiency measurement all have their merits. However, they generate different results and it is in principle impossible to know which of them produces ”true” estimates. We argue that instead of choosing between approaches, the analyst can average across the results generated by them. Unfortunately, this begs the question which averaging method to use? This paper examines the model averaging approaches of Hansen and Racine (2012), which can provide a vehicle to weight predictions (in the form of productivity and efficiency measurements) from different nonstructural methods. We first describe the jackknife model averaging estimator proposed by Hansen and Racine (2012) and illustrate how to apply the technique to a set of competing stochastic frontier estimators. The derived method is then used to analyze productivity and efficiency dynamics in 25 high-industrialized countries over the period 1990 to 2014. Through the empirical application, we show that the model averaging method provides relatively stable estimates, in comparison to standard model selection methods that simply select one model with the highest measure of goodness of fit. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","C14; C23; model averaging; O40; panel data; productivity; stochastic frontiers; time varying heterogeneity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088840532

Users' activities increased steadily from 2014 to 2016, but dropped in 2017. Users are most active from July to September, on weekdays, and from noon to evening time. The month-, day-, and hour-based behaviours changed through years. The analysis of big data determines strategic and operational management and marketing decision-making. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the usage patterns of their websites allow organisations to make a range of strategic, marketing, pricing and distribution decisions to optimise their performance. Fluctuation of website usage and level of customer engagement have implications on customer support and services, as well as strategic partnership decisions. Originality/value: Leveraging the power of big data analytics, this paper adds to the existing literature by performing a comprehensive analysis on the temporal dynamics of users' online browsing behaviours. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Browsing activity; Hotel website; Strategic and tactical management; Temporal analysis; Weblog data; Website stickiness","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Commerce; Decision making; Dynamics; Hotels; Informatics; Marketing; Websites; Browsing behaviour; Comprehensive analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Marketing decision; Marketing strategy; Operational management; Post hoc comparisons; Strategic partnership; Data Analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088693959

In addition, a modified Wald test in an augmented vector autoregressive model, developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), is used to investigate the existence of a long-run causality between the variables. The cointegration analysis confirms the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables, while fuel-mining exports are found to have a negative impact on economic growth.

Given these findings, the government should focus on development expenditures and reduce non-development expenditures for higher economic growth. However, the authors argue that this may not be the case, as government consumption expenditures along with better institutional quality promote growth via reduced corruption, reduction of political risks and good governance. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidences that both government consumption and development expenditure promote growth in the presence of better institutional quality. Design/methodology/approach: This paper re-examines the impact of government expenditures on growth whilst controlling institutional factors for a sample of 30 developed and 91 developing countries from 1984 to 2017. Government expenditure is segregated into consumption and development expenditures. Findings: The results are consistent with existing findings where government consumption expenditures have a negative effect on growth and government development expenditures contribute positively towards growth. However, when the authors conditioned government consumption expenditures with institutional variables, results suggest that in the presence of good institutions, both government consumption and development expenditures promote growth. Practical implications: The findings in this paper suggest that in the presence of good institutions, government consumption expenditures will contribute positively towards growth. The results are relatively consistent for both developing and developed economies, which suggests the importance of institutional factors leading to a parallel movement towards long run growth path. In other words, long run economic growth is driven by a similar institutional environment. Originality/value: Both developed and developing countries show similar reactions towards consumption and development expenditures. This indicates that despite the level of development, government expenditures do contribute positively towards growth especially in the presence of better-quality institutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Developing and developed countries; Economic growth; Government expenditures; Institutions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085888371

To support a critical sourcing decision, we propose a supplier evaluation decision-aid tool within the framework of business analytics, which takes in to account the multiple facets of supplier performance evaluation criteria. As a core of such a tool, we develop a relatively new model that is capable of considering both objective and subjective performance criteria simultaneously using a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP).

Results from a difference-in-difference analysis of the National Statistics Bureau's regular household survey suggest that the reforms increased consumption and income, in particular for less wealthy and less educated households, with estimated benefits well above the cost of implementation. Local labour supply increased with the young shifting towards agriculture and the old towards off-farm employment. The reforms also contributed to higher agricultural yields and profits through three channels, namely: (i) greater rental market activity that transferred land to more productive producers; (ii) substitution of purchased inputs for labour; and (iii) a shift out of grains towards vegetables, corn, and oilseeds all of which offer higher levels of profitability. All of these findings are consistent with the notion that, without reforms, imperfections in factor markets undermined investment and functioning of land and labour markets, preventing high-value peri-urban land from being used most effectively and reducing job creation. © 2019 The World Bank.

Yet existing research has largely failed to examine how attitudes and behaviors vary as a function of the specific financial product (e.g., debt type). We ask to what extent people differentiate between similarly categorized financial products (e.g., debt or investment) as a function of their terms (e.g., interest costs and expected returns) and whether such differentiation predicts financial health. Across four studies, we find not only that there are individual differences in attitudes toward similar financial products (e.g., two distinct loans), but also that the extent to which a consumer is averse to high-cost versus low-cost products predicts financial health. This relationship cannot be fully explained by financial literacy, numeracy, or intertemporal discounting. In addition, nudging people toward differentiating between financial products promotes decisions that are aligned with financial health. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","consumer financial decision making; debt; financial literacy; investment; well-being","article; consumer; decision making; human; investment; literacy; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067443602

Specifically, the study uses standpoint theory and theories of newsroom economics to examine how 2 factors—newsroom diversity and audience demographics—affect the extent to which Latinos are mentioned in tweets posted by news organizations. Results show that Latinos are mostly absent on Twitter, though they are more visible than other minorities such as Asian Americans. However, the economic pressures of the media business motivate news outlets to appeal to their audiences’ needs and tastes, such that newspapers circulating in diverse markets with a large Latino population are more likely to feature Latinos in their tweets, through promoting the role of Latino journalists in the newsroom. This is especially true for national media that are characterized with a greater willingness to cater to a diverse audience. This study thus argues that promoting the visibility of Latinos on social media news is not easy—increasing diversity in the newsroom can be the first step, but it is most effective for publications that cater to diverse audiences. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Latinos; market incentives; newsroom diversity; Twitter; visibility","article; Asian American; economics; Hispanic; human; market; organization; publishing; social media; visibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065726683

However, there is considerable ambiguity about the effects of deals on brand evaluations, in particular, the effects on preconsumption brand evaluations. This ambiguity can influence the decisions by retailers to join daily deals platforms, which operate as double-sided networked markets. We perform a series of laboratory experiments to test the effect of offering a deal in these platforms on consumers’ preconsumption brand evaluations. Our research shows that brand evaluations are contingent on retailer characteristics (price segment and age), customarily reported deal-performance statistics (number of views and purchases of the focal deal), and competitive deal intensity. Furthermore, the paper finds that the effect of daily deals on brand evaluation differs substantially from that associated with regular print coupons, which operate without the benefits of a platform-based model. Finally, local competition from deals in the platform is shown to have a significant negative spillover effect on neighboring retailers who do not offer deals. Our work thus informs retailers considering joining deals platforms about potential costs associated with such a decision, while also providing insights for platform owners on how they may help mitigate some of these losses in brand value for members of their ecosystem. Our research thus provides for a fuller and more nuanced evaluation of daily deals’ effects on brand evaluations.

To counter the dangers, they need information in a short period. Such need creates the opportunity for misinformation. Such misinformation can result in information harms that can generate short- or long-term consequences. Literature review: Prior researchers have tackled the situation by using technical or behavioral approaches. Research question: What are the harms from misinformation? We propose a taxonomy of 15 information harms grouped in 8 categories and assess the perception of risk regarding the harms through a survey of respondents who have experienced crisis response situations. Methodology: This paper examines two scenarios, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the 2017 Oroville Dam evacuation order crises, through two dimensions: Likelihood of occurrence and Level of impacts of the harms. Results and conclusions: Findings are presented through visualization and test results for significant differences of harms between scenarios. Similar groups of harms are identified with different severity levels based on post hoc analyses: those with 1. high likelihood and low impact (psychological and confusion harms), 2. low likelihood and low impact (reputation and privacy harms), and 3. low likelihood and high impact (physical, financial, safety, and social harms). In addition to establishing the taxonomy of misinformation harms, findings will have practical value in emergency response and recovery activities to effectively prioritize resources to minimize specific harms from misinformation in crises. Further research directions are also discussed. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Disaster; harms; humanitarian crises; injuries; misinformation; perceptions; risk; taxonomy","Risk assessment; Risk perception; Surveys; Taxonomies; Behavioral approaches; Crisis response; Emergency response; Evacuation order; Literature reviews; Research problems; Research questions; Short periods; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097350414

However, cost efficiency scores declined suggesting health outputs rose by a proportionally smaller margin than health care costs. We further investigate efficiency changes for ACA-induced Medicaid expansions.

The seller knows only that the demand is a linear function of the price, but does not know the parameters involved in the demand function. However, the seller knows that each parameter involved in the demand function belongs to a known interval. The seller's objective is to determine the optimal price for the entire selling season to minimize the maximum regret, where the maximum regret is defined as the maximum possible loss of revenue due to not knowing the precise values of the parameters.

A further focus is to evaluate the county-level tradeoffs between the returns and risks of future economic growth that affect the expected benefits and variance of forest carbon storage by constructing a mean–variance tradeoff frontier. Because of concavity of the mean–variance tradeoff frontier, mitigating risk by dispersing budget allocations among counties is advisable, particularly if conservation agencies focus on the returns with little or no regard for the risks associated with future growth at the initial policy-making stage. The different dispersions of the budget among counties for different weights placed on risk minimization provide clear evidence that spatial targeting for conservation and restoration investments such as forest carbon payments needs to consider the risk preferences of conservation agencies regarding conservation costs.

The conditional LE elasticity of income estimates are found to vary across fitted models and the more robust flexible Box–Cox power model outperforms the restrictive linear and log specifications fitted in past work. Contrary to past findings indicating large negative and highly elastic (statistically significant) LE elasticity of income, new results from the preferred fully flexible Box–Cox model incorporating the nonlinear effect yield a much smaller negative (statistically significant) and inelastic LE elasticity of income estimate.

We focused on the role of firm size and composition in affecting the timing of patent purchases and the subsequent payoff; particularly, how firms’ R&D intensity and overall scale affect purchasing decisions and commercial success of the drugs. The quantitative results show that, on average, firms with larger scale and stronger R&D departments are more likely to purchase drug patents later; furthermore, a strong R&D department contributes positively to drug sales and market shares through a better selection process of patents. The economics intuition is that firms with a larger scale and greater emphasis on R&D investment have advantages in producing in-house innovation, so they tend to be more selective when buying from outsources. This results in buying patents later and better subsequent commercial performance on the drugs that firms purchased. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Commercial Performance; Patent Transfer; R&D; Timing of Purchase","data acquisition; econometrics; firm size; industrial performance; innovation; numerical model; performance assessment; research and development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087111709

The results also show that demand is greatest late in the advance sales period, providing the first finding that a late-season high-demand period coincides with a late-season increase in aggregate price sensitivity. The high-demand effect more than offsets the high-price-responsiveness pattern, leading the firm to increase prices throughout the advance sales period.

Many countries do not have standardized reference costs so costs used often vary between studies, thereby reducing transparency and transferability. The present review provided a comprehensive overview of cost sources and suggested unit costs for France, Germany and Italy, to support health economic evaluations in these countries, particularly in the field of diabetes. Methods: A literature review was conducted across multiple databases to identify published unit costs and cost data sources for resource items commonly used in health economic evaluations of antidiabetic therapies. The quality of unit cost reporting was assessed with regard to comprehensiveness of cost reporting and referencing as well as accessibility of cost sources from published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of antidiabetic medications. Results: An overview of cost sources, including tariff and fee schedules as well as published estimates, was developed for France, Germany and Italy, covering primary and specialist outpatient care, emergency care, hospital treatment, pharmacy costs and lost productivity. Based on these sources, unit cost datasets were suggested for each country. The assessment of unit cost reporting showed that only 60% and 40% of CEAs reported unit costs and referenced them for all pharmacy items, respectively.

As such, a PPP is not a generic contract between buyer and supplier but rather a specific contractual arrangement between a public buyer and private supplier. The contract captures the responsibilities of each party in achieving a specific set of performance objectives. Given budgetary pressures faced by public agencies, there is an increasing need for suppliers to make investments which could reduce future-year costs of meeting contract performance objectives. This research addresses two overarching questions specific to the issue of private, supplier-side investment. First, “how does public agency and private supplier perception of risk influence contract duration?” and second, “how does contract duration influence private investment?” To answer these questions, structured interviews were conducted with those in public agencies and private, supplier firms actively engaged in PPPs. Factors suspected to contribute to the risk position of public and private actors were evaluated. Additionally, linkages between public buyer-private supplier risk position, contract duration and private, supplier-side investment were addressed. Outcomes suggest properly structured long-term contracts may: 1) provide the risk mitigation mechanisms needed for both public and private actors, and 2) facilitate private, supplier-side investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Contract duration; Decision making; Organizations; Public-private partnerships; Sensemaking","Budget control; Investments; Sales; Budgetary pressures; Contract performance; Contractual arrangements; Formal contracts; Long-term contracts; Performance objective; Private investment; Public private partnerships; Risk perception; decision making; investment; perception; public-private partnership; risk assessment; social organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092043203

The literature finds that the relationship between performance and corporate governance quality can be positive, non-existing or even negative. To resolve this puzzle, we introduce a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to construct an alternative corporate governance quality synthesising companies’ practices and mechanisms through an exhaustive pair comparison procedures based on outranking relationships analysis. Our approach compares the aggregate quality with a well-known corporate governance index, ASSET4 ESG in Thomson Reuters Datastream, using data for the US firms. Using this MCDA approach based on PROMETHEE methods and econometric analysis, we obtain consistently a negative and strong link between firm performance and corporate governance quality.

Current transit riders were intercepted in the field from November 2017 through January 2018, according to a sampling plan based on local ridership information, in order to gain a representative sample for analysis. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding the intercepted trip, along with demographic and travel experience information. The survey included a series of stated-preference responses where the current trip is randomly disrupted and alternative travel modes are proposed with service characteristics randomly altered from a baseline scenario. This was designed to understand individual trade-offs between various mode alternatives and travel plan modification strategies under a variety of scenarios. Altogether, 659 transit riders gave responses to 2626 different disruption scenarios. In general, a plurality of riders (49%) choose to continue using transit, either waiting for service restoration or using agency-provided shuttle service, although at a decreasing rate as the travel delay increases. Fewer riders, approximately 15%, choose to alter their activity patterns altogether, while 26% would alter their travel to use either a taxi or an alternative transportation network company (TNC). Having a more detailed understanding of the behavior of riders under various disruption scenarios should allow transit agencies to better prepare for service recovery and restoration after and during local disruptions. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Emergency and disruption response; Intercept survey; Resilience of operations; Stated-preference survey; Transit","Economic and social effects; Restoration; Taxicabs; Representative sample; Service characteristics; Service disruptions; Service recoveries; Service restoration; Stated preferences; Transportation network; Travel experiences; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091196497

This study aims to use survey data to measure financial distress and ascertain the socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural factors associated with it among Zimbabweans. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 1,006 survey respondents from five provinces of Zimbabwe was used. The principal component analysis approach was used to create a composite financial distress score. The t-test for the equality of means and analysis of variance were used to test for the difference in financial distress between groups, whilst the ordinary least squares regression was used to determine the factors associated with financial distress after controlling for other factors. Findings: The study found that consumer financial distress was mainly explained by locality (urban/rural and province), frequency and level of income (informality) and age. Having saved in the past 12 months did not significantly differentiate savers from non-savers on financial distress. The study also found that gender, level of education, marital status, role in household financial decision-making and role in household provisioning were not significant predictors of financial distress. Research limitations/implications: The findings have policy implications, especially for the government of Zimbabwe, its agencies and local authorities. Enacting policies that create opportunities for inclusive and sustainable livelihoods and economic growth should be the priority. In addition, instituting favourable policies that allow informal business to grow, formalise and integrate with the formal economy may help to sustainably grow the economy and alleviate the financial hardships among consumers. For consumers, adopting financial behaviours that ensure that they live within their means cannot be over emphasised. Originality/value: This is the first paper to profile the socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural factors associated with financial distress during the economic downturn among the impoverished Zimbabweans.

Many mathematical models have been developed to approximate MDRO transmission dynamics, focusing most often on evaluating the impact of various infection-control strategies. However, although the insights derived from these studies are useful, the models do not typically have the ability to support decision making for infection-control practitioners in real time. In this study, we design a detailed agent-based model of MDRO transmission—focusing on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the intensive care unit setting—and validate its transmission dynamics using data collected during a multisite randomized, controlled trial. We leverage this model to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a prediction-driven approach for targeting patients for contact precautions (i.e., requiring all visiting healthcare workers to wear personal protective equipment) in a simulated intensive care unit based on their daily likelihood of becoming colonized by the organism.

Indeed, this crucial stage is left to the decision makers (DMs) to make decisions based on their experience, available information, mindset and habits without any scientific and systematic approach. In this paper, we present a general formal model for decision-making and new knowledge generation that can be used in post-data mining analysis to derive better decisions. The proposed model is formulated in the framework of Habitual Domains theory. The concepts of optimization in changeable spaces and the related solution, the wonderful solution, are introduced in Part I of the paper. Further, ways on how to find wonderful solutions by expanding DMs Habitual Domains in post-data mining analysis and decision-making are presented with applications in Part II of the paper. The proposed model is a significant departure from the traditional decision models that are based on utility function.

Although a rich literature exists for addressing this problem, existing approaches mostly rely on first- and second-order properties of the time series, since they typically assume linearity of the underlying process. Often, these are inadequate for effective classification of nonlinear time series data such as Google Trends data. Given these methodological deficiencies and the abundance of nonlinear time series that persist among real-world phenomena, we introduce an approach that merges higher order spectral analysis with deep convolutional neural networks for classifying time series.

The common perception is that Republicans are more likely to believe a person’s gender is determined by their sex at birth than Democrats. Such beliefs can influence voting, policies and practices. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data on employment outcomes and other individual level characteristics are used from two surveys focusing on transgender individuals for the periods 2008 and 2015. These surveys represent the largest collection of data that examines the experiences of transgender people in the USA. To establish a casual effect, this analysis employs fixed effects Ordinary Least Squares methods and Propensity Score Matching algorithms. Findings: Exploiting variations in the party affiliation of governors and liberal state governments, the study finds mixed employment effects of living in a Democratic-governed liberal state. Specifically, this paper shows that transgender people living in such states have an 18 percentage point (or 26 percent) higher likelihood of being employed in the 2008 survey, but a 16.4 percentage point (or 25 percent) lower likelihood of being employed in the 2015 survey. Despite the lower propensity to be out of the labor market in the 2008 sample, results from both surveys indicate a higher likelihood of being unemployed. These findings are robust to the inclusion of additional covariates (including confounders), alternative specifications and different estimation techniques. Heterogeneous effects are also explored. Originality/value: To the authors’ current knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the relationship between living in democratically governed liberal states and labor market circumstances of transgender people in the USA. This is the first paper to establish a causal relationship using matching techniques. The paper also provides suggestive evidence of the role of government ideology in influencing the working lives of transgender people. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discrimination in employment; Economics; Employment; Labour market; Propensity Score Matching; Transgender",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074731799

If this is the case, culture may impede any positive externalities from FDI. On the other hand, if the people of the host country embrace injections of FDI, this may lead to boosts in not only short-run factors of production but also longer-term technological spillovers. We measure what role cultural make-up of a country plays on the effect of FDI on growth in GDP. Design/methodology/approach: Using values system data from the World Values Survey (WVS), and socioeconomic data from the World Bank, we estimate and plot the marginal effect of FDI on growth as a function of a country's values system for a panel of 73 countries over a span of three decades. Findings: We find that the marginal effect of FDI on growth in GDP differs across varying degrees of cultural values, even after adjusting for level of development. In other words, our analysis indicates that a country's cultural norms do indeed affect foreign investment's impact on economic growth. Originality/value: To date there is no research that systematically assesses the effect that cultural make-up has on the marginal effect of FDI on growth. We go beyond the use of isolated cultural variables by using data on cultural dimensions that account for most of the observed cultural differences between countries. We believe our findings will work as a launchpad for more novel ways to capture country heterogeneity in growth research.

While these effects are small, they indicate that a municipality’s decision to abate has generated enough growth in property values, either through improvements to physical property or positive capitalization for existing property values, to offset the negative effects of an abatement.

Our methodology takes into account the specific features of the data (namely outliers, heterogeneity, and cross panel correlations) and overcomes most criticisms previously raised on growth regressions. The most important evidence reveals that government current expenditure decreases the factor shares and has no effect on total factor productivity (TFP). Trade affects the TFP and the Biased Technical Change (BTC) components, decreasing the factor shares. Moreover, human capital decreases TFP and increases the BTC contribution to growth.

Using crop insurance unit-level datasets from five states, we find evidence that agent market concentration and agents’ market share matter in the insurance coverage decisions of producers but that the economic significance of the influence is relatively small.

Most of the existing studies use some functions to explicitly specify the relationship between degradation parameters and environmental conditions so as to reveal how the degradation process evolves over time. However, in many applications, the assumptions needed for establishing these functions cannot be validated in engineering practice or they cannot accurately model the entire underlying degradation mechanism. In contrast to previous work, the focus of our study is placed on product degradation prognosis by implementing an ensemble learning method. This method combines the stochastic process modeling approach and the machine learning approach, taking advantage of these approaches to gain a more accurate and stable degradation prediction. The proposed method is demonstrated by some simulation examples and by a case study of lithium-ion battery accelerated degradation test.

In this paper, using data from the UK Labour Force Survey in 2007, we contribute to the rich body of the literature by estimating a model using the kernel mixed-data-type conditional-probability (KMDTCP) estimator. We extend the analysis by comparing the predicted probabilities of the KMDTCP estimator with the estimates of a multinomial logit (MNL) model. Additionally, kernel smoothing specification tests are applied in order to compare different functional forms for the independent variables in the MNL model against the KMDTCP estimates. Our results demonstrate that the difference between the predictions from the KMDTCP estimator and the MNL is reduced when the functional form of continuous independent variables in the MNL model is relaxed to a semi-parametric form using dummy variables and interaction terms. The properties that are captured by the KMDTCP estimator show clearly that the propensity to work decreases with the increase in the number of dependent children. Furthermore, our analyses show that females older than 40 years of age have a high propensity to work irrespective of the number of dependent children. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conditional-density; Kernel; Labour force; Logit; Multinomial; Smoothing tests","decision making; econometrics; empirical analysis; estimation method; female behavior; labor participation; labor standard; probability; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062628357

However, empirical studies are needed to understand how to manage this interface within a new product development (NPD) context. This study, grounded in information processing theory, proposes a new model to classify integrating mechanisms as either information-sharing forums or optimizers. This model further postulates the greater capacity of optimizer mechanisms for improving NPD commercial and financial performance, as well as speed. The empirical results, obtained from a sample of 141 firms, show that forums only improve NPD speed, whereas optimizer mechanisms evoke better commercial and financial performance.

The proposed model of executives' commitment to information security is an interaction model (in addition to the cost of a security solution, and the risk and the potential loss of a security threat) consisting of the interaction between an executive's preferred subordinate influence approach (PSIA), rational or inspirational, and the framing, positive or negative, of a security proposal. The interaction of these two constructs affects the executive's commitment to an information security proposal. The model is tested using a scenario-based experiment that elicited responses from business executives across 100+ organizations. Results show that the interaction of the negative framing of a proposal and the inspirational PSIA of an executive affects his or her commitment to information security. Further, negative framing of a proposal and the cost of the security solution interact to decrease the executive's commitment to information security. This study underscores that prescriptions for business executives from normative models in information security spending must be complemented with appropriately framed messages to account for the differences in executives' PSIA (rational and inspirational) and cognitive biases. © 2020 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","cognitive bias; heuristic systematic model; negative framing; prospect theory; resource allocation","Decision making; Security systems; Business executives; Cognitive bias; Interaction model; Normative models; Potential loss; Scenario-based; Security solutions; Security threats; Security of data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085492036

Design/methodology/approach: Using a unique data set, which has developed detailed long-run indices of institutional change in Mozambique from 1900 onwards, the research utilizes time-series econometrics to estimate cointegration relations and Vector Autoregressive and Vector Error Correction models, and also Granger causality, correlation and residual analysis when interpreting the estimation results. Findings: It shows support for path dependence in political and economic institutions as well as the critical juncture theory and modernization hypothesis, and for webs of association between these institutions and economic development. It provides evidence of an equilibrium-dependent process, where history does matter (as do early conditions), and whose impact may differ depending on the nature of institutional arrangements. Various institutions created during colonial times have a bearing on the present state of institutions in Mozambique, as reflected in important continuities regarding the forms of political economy, among others. Originality/value: The work contributes to existing research not only through the employment of a new set of institutional measures, which allows for a particularly long time-series investigation in a developing country setting, but also through its contribution to studies on modernization and critical junctures but in a longitudinal manner which allows for the exploration of complex dynamics embedded within a country’s particular political economy. The implications are far-reaching and carry importance beyond the academy given the pressure on policymakers to get things right because of the persistence of institutions and their consequences and the associated path dependency. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa; Economic development; Economic growth; Institutional change; Institutional development; Longitudinal time series; Modernization; Mozambique; Path dependency; Time-series analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076591373

Two measures of real interest rates are included in the present analysis, ex post real interest rate and ex ante real interest rate. Empirical estimations for the 1981–2018 period provide strong support for the hypothesis. They reveal that the real interest rate yield on high-grade tax-exempt municipal bonds is a decreasing function of the maximum marginal federal personal income tax, whereas the real interest rate yield on taxable ten-year Treasury notes is an increasing function of that same tax rate.

The Chinese central government has been supporting shale gas development since 2011. There are hopes that shale gas development, along with major efforts in renewable energy systems, can bring a fundamental change in the nation’s current coal-dependent energy system. Numerous challenges have slowed implementation including resistance to development of the industry by local residents living near shale gas sites. A significant body of research has examined the effectiveness of incentives in changing risk perceptions and attitudes toward the siting of industrial projects in the Western context. The present research identifies whether governmental incentives increase the extent of local support for shale gas projects in the Chinese context. Specifically, this paper strives to study two types of incentives: direct compensation to households bearing the potential negative impacts of shale gas projects and, household compensation accompanied by allocation of a portion of the shale tax revenues to local communities where the development occurs. An online survey with an embedded experiment was designed and conducted in August 2016 in five Chinese provinces where there are current or future shale gas projects. The experiment shows that household compensation alone or in combination with community reinvestment significantly increases local support of shale gas projects. Further, we found that the respondents most likely to be supportive after the experimental treatments are those who are young, more highly educated, have higher income, and perceive themselves as living close to a project. This research sheds light on how incentives might help contribute to resolution of siting controversies or prevent the onset of such controversies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attitudes toward energy development; community reinvestment; experiment; household compensation; Shale gas","Experiments; Gases; Industrial research; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Risk perception; Central government; community reinvestment; Energy development; Fundamental changes; Gas development; Industrial projects; Local residents; Renewable energy systems; Shale gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062042874

We examine the return on assets (ROA) and small business lending efficiency of MDIs when compared to what we categorize as ""non-MDI"" depositories, ceteris paribus. We also examine these institutions for a period that includes a recent environmental shock, the 2008 financial crisis and the post-recessionary period. Using data from the Reports of Condition and Income (call reports) for a substantial set of FDIC-insured banks in the United States, we apply a data envelopment analysis (DEA) to determine how a set of MDIs perform relative to comparable institutions. Recognizing that MDIs are not homogeneous, we also examine relative efficiency across types of MDIs by racial/ethnic grouping. The results indicate that MDIs are not less efficient systematically and that there are differences across MDI types. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","banking; data envelopment analysis; efficiency evaluation; Minority depository institutions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082503424

We investigate the relative performance of three count data models used with data of the kind typically found in survey data. We create a dataset based on observed recreational trip counts and associated trip costs that exhibits substantial rounding. We then conduct a Monte Carlo simulation exercise to compare the estimated parameters, willingness to pay, and the average consumer surplus per trip for three alternative estimators: a standard Poisson model with no adjustment for rounding, a censored Poisson model, a grouped Poisson model, and a latent class Poisson model with rounding and non-rounding classes. The standard Poisson model with no adjustment for rounding exhibits significant and persistent bias, especially in estimates of non-linear effects.

We illustrate this with the logarithmic power series distribution, and we compare four published algorithms designed to generate random variates from a logarithmic distribution to the aliasing method of random variate generation from an NTSF version of the same distribution.

Yet, much of the work has explored the role of undirected and homogeneous networks. In real cases, many networks are directed. The flow of information, benefits or observations is directed from one node towards another node. Real networks are also heterogeneous, for example, few nodes have a high degree while many others have a low degree. In this article, we report on the results of an evolutionary agent-based model in which a group of agents, in our case firms, collectively search a complex (rugged) technological landscape and observe each other's solutions with different frequencies through different observation networks. Two sets of networks are considered in the analysis. The first set comprises undirected networks that vary in terms of efficiency while the second set comprises directed networks that vary in terms of homogeneity of node degree. We find that collective innovation (described as an exploration of a technology landscape) improves average fitness over independent search because information about better innovations can diffuse faster through the network at an early stage. Moreover, we find that efficient networks outperform inefficient ones in the first stages of the search, but, given their slower rate of information diffusion, some of the inefficient networks require additional independent search which can guarantee a marginally better performance at later stages. We also find that degree homogeneous and undirected networks achieve better fitness on average than heterogeneous and directed ones. Finally, we apply our model to a simplified scenario of innovation diffusion in a financial system by using an empirical network obtained from the Thomson Reuters DealScan database. For this illustrative case study, our results are presented and discussed from the perspective of system-level technological innovation. We conclude by discussing implications for technological innovation and possible extensions. © 2019 The authors 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Such a question is difficult to address using typical household surveys that provide a limited amount of information on the attributes of the jobs. To address this question, a small but growing number of studies have turned to the use of stated preference experiments; but the extent to which stated choices by respondents reflect systematic trade-offs across job characteristics remains an open question. We use two popular types of experiments (profile case best–worst scaling and multi-profile case best–worst scaling) to elicit job preferences of nursing students and junior nurses in Australia. Each person participated in both types of experiments twice, within a span of about 15 months. Using a novel joint likelihood approach that links a decision-maker's preferences across the two types of experiments and over time, we find that the decision-makers make similar trade-offs across job characteristics in both types of experiments and in both time periods, except for the trade-off between salary and other attributes. The valuation of salary falls significantly over time relative to other job attributes for both types of experiments. Also, within each period, salary is less valued in the profile case compared to the more traditional multi-profile case. © 2020 Canadian Economics Association",,"decision making; employment generation; experimental study; job search; panel data; trade-off; wage determination; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079734341

The problem of interest is how to evaluate the efficiencies of a set of comparable such processes in the presence of both products and co-products. In particular, there has been an increasing interest in co-products that can be considered as playing a dual role as either outputs from or inputs to the process involved. Efficiency measurement in certain situations where both products and co-products are present can be addressed using data envelopment analysis (DEA). For example, reclaimed asphalt coming from the resurfacing of highways in various districts offers an opportunity to perform maintenance at a lower cost, when that reclaimed material serves as an input together with new or virgin materials. At the same time, there is an undesirable environmental impact when reclaimed asphalt (not reused) serves as an output. In the current paper, we develop a DEA-based methodology to evaluate the efficiency of maintenance activities in the presence of both products and co-products. The problem concerns how to examine co-products that can have positive value, up to a certain point, but beyond this point there are disposal/environmental costs that must be considered. We use our developed model to examine the efficiency of resurfacing operations in a set of 18 districts in a Canadian province. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.","Co-products; DEA; dual role variables; undesirable factor","Asphalt; Data envelopment analysis; Environmental impact; Reclamation; Co-products; Dual role; Efficiency measurement; Maintenance activity; Operational process; Reclaimed materials; Undesirable factors; Virgin materials; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062323129

Design/methodology/approach: To provide a holistic evaluation of public DBP performance, this study first employs the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach to construct a relative performance measure that simultaneously takes into account the association between investment inputs and performance outputs across DBPs in our sample. A DEA regression model is then constructed to empirically examine the impact of pension governance on public DBP performance. Findings: Using 1,544 hand-collected observations in the USA from 2002 to 2013, the findings show that the public DBP plans with a small board, appointed board trustees, and a separate investment council exhibit better performance. Practical implications: The effectiveness of pension governance has increasingly drawn public attention, as it affects the performance of the public DBP plans that especially matter to public employees. The empirical findings of this research offer insights into recent calls to reexamine public DBP management practices and to carry out related public pension fund policy reforms. Originality/value: The examination of public DBP governance practices in this study enriches the governance literature, particularly research on public pension funds, by using public sector data.

The purpose of this paper is to examine firms’ optimal contract negotiation strategies in buyer–supplier–supplier triads where there are concurrent negotiations between the retailer and two competing manufacturers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider a two-echelon supply chain, in which the retailer has the option of segmented or unified negotiation policy, whereas the two competing manufacturers can withhold or share production cost information in the negotiation. Based on game theory, the authors derive the manufacturers’ optimal wholesale prices and the retailer’s optimal retail prices with eight possible scenarios. Optimal strategic choices and operational decisions are then explored through the comparative analysis of equilibriums of eight possible scenarios. Findings: The authors find that the retailer will adopt different negotiation strategies depending on manufacturers’ decisions on sharing or withholding their production-cost information. When both manufacturers share their production-cost information, the retailer will adopt a unified negotiation policy. The high-efficiency manufacturer should adopt the same information-sharing strategy as the low-efficiency manufacturer in order to gain more profit. Originality/value: The modelling helps to bring further clarity in supply chain contract negotiation by offering a conceptual framework to enhance our understanding of the effects of information-sharing strategy and negotiation policy in the negotiation process form the perspectives of all engaging parties. Managerial insights derived from the research will enable retailers and manufacturers to make informed and better strategic and operational decisions to improve market competitiveness. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asymmetric information; Buyer–supplier–supplier triads; Game theory; Negotiation policy","Contracts; Costs; Efficiency; Game theory; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Sales; Supply chains; Asymmetric information; Conceptual frameworks; Concurrent negotiation; Design/methodology/approach; Information sharing strategies; Operational decisions; Supply chain contracts; Two-echelon supply chain; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077591106

In this article, we develop a Bayesian variable-selection method for the mean function and the performance of the proposed method can be guaranteed by the convergence property of Gibbs sampler. A real-life application on piston design from the computer experiment literature is used to illustrate its implementation.

Some of the early management theorists like Frederick Winslow Taylor talked about how overall efficiency could be improved if management undertook to make second-class workers into first-class workers. The efficiency wage argument put forth by Sidney Webb held that a minimum wage would actually encourage managers to invest in their workers’ human capital. This paper refocuses the debate on the issues that the minimum wage really speaks to: the type of society that we want to be. On the basis of CPS data, I show that the effective minimum wage population is considerably larger than commonly supposed, and that today’s unskilled workers are no different than the unskilled industrial workers during Taylor’s time. Therefore, Taylor’s argument about making second-class workers into first-class workers through efficiency wages still has application to today’s growing low-wage labor market. © 2016, © 2016 The Association for Social Economics.","efficiency wage; high road; management; minimum wage; Taylorism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021721110

The proposed research model involves two level configurations—industry context and selling strategies—to predict high and low scores of a firm’s profitability. The industry context configuration model comprises industry stability, product homogeneity, price sensitivity, and switching cost. Selling strategies include customer-focused, competitor-focused, and margin-focused approaches. Design/methodology – This is the first empirical study that calculates causal models using a combination of industry context and selling strategy factors to predict profitability. Data obtained from the marketing managers of cosmetics firms are used to test the proposed configurational model using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). It contributes to the current knowledge of business marketing by identifying the factors necessary to achieve profitability using analysis of condition (ANC). Findings – The results revealed that unique and distinct models explain the conditions for high and low profitability in the Indonesian and Malaysian halal cosmetic markets. While customer-focused selling strategy is necessary to attain a higher profit in both the markets, margin-focused selling strategy appears to be an essential factor only in Malaysia. Complexity of the interactions of selling strategies with industry factors and differences between across two study markets confirmed that complexity theory can support the research configurational model. The theoretical and practical implications are also illustrated. Originality/value – Despite the rapid growth of the global halal industry, there is little knowledge about the halal cosmetic market. This study contributes to the current literature of the halal market by performing a set of asymmetric analytical approaches using a complex theoretical model. It also deepens our understating of how the Korean firms can approach the Muslim consumer’s needs to generate more beneficial turnover/revenue. © 2020 Korea Trade Research Association.

We show that with two experts correlation unambiguously tightens the conditions on preferences for a truth-telling equilibrium. However, with multiple experts the effect of correlation on the incentives to report information truthfully can be non-monotonic: while little and large levels of correlation hinder truth-telling, intermediate levels may discipline experts’ equilibrium behaviour and foster truthful communication. We discuss the implications of our results for the political discussion in the presence of ‘selective exposure’ to media, where similarity in preferences comes with higher correlation, and a trade-off between truth-telling incentives and informational content arises. © 2020 Royal Economic Society.

Many companies have tried to imitate but have not achieved Toyota-like results. Failure in the ability to replicate Toyota's supportive culture has been suggested as a cause for the lack of success. Studies on lean implementation have been conducted from external views focusing on visible indicators, but few seek the employee's perception of lean initiatives. The authors propose a Toyota Production System – Toyota Way (TPS-TW) model approach using employee perception and quantitative performance metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This research represents an improvement of a lean assessment instrument using quantifiable performance metrics for validation and testing it in the Chinese automotive industry. A survey was developed and executed in the Chinese automotive industry with participants involved with lean implementation. Experts helped examine the content validity, and reliability analysis was used to study the structure of the assessment instrument and evaluate internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis and structured equation modeling were used to test the construct validity. Finally, survey results and actual performance were analyzed. Findings: The results of this research validated the TPS-TW model and assessment instrument in the Chinese automotive industry. Originality/value: This research validates an employee perception survey that can be utilized by organizations to understand the state of their lean implementation. The research supports the use of employee perception to reflect the reality of a lean initiative and proves the TPS-TW model is an effective theoretical framework for assessment. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee perception; Lean; Lean assessment; Survey development; Toyota production system","Automobile manufacture; Factor analysis; Instrument testing; Lean production; Personnel; Reliability analysis; Assessment instruments; Confirmatory factor analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Employee's perceptions; Internal consistency; Structured equation modeling; Theoretical framework; Toyota Production System; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098621627

For example, the story associated with the well-known newsvendor model is one of stocking for an upcoming selling season that will happen x units of time from now, where x is exogenous. In this paper, we re-visit the capacity planning decision by assuming that demand follows a stochastic process and study what happens when both the time of sale and capacity are decisions. When the selling price is fixed, our baseline case, we find that the optimal time to sell is either now or never. In contrast, when the selling price is stochastic, the optimal time to serve demand is somewhere between now and never. Thus, we link timing preference to two primary sources: uncertainty in demand and uncertainty in the selling price. Our results are useful whenever firms have considerable control over timing, such as in events when firms launch new products or in instances when there is no apparent selling season. © 2020 Now Publishers Inc.

Methods: Using a cross-sectional, single state, mailed questionnaire, we surveyed 170 physicians about their perspectives on HDSE and interest in an HDSE program. Descriptive statistics and a multivariable logistic regression are presented. Results: Among the 70.5% of responding eligible physicians, 75% of physicians had less HDSE than they would like and 90% were interested in obtaining more HDSE. Thirty-five percent of physicians were interested in joining the described HDSE program. The most prevalent barriers to obtaining HDSE were a lack of time and existing programs. Physician perspectives were similar across specialties, years in practice, and rurality. Conclusion: There is a high unmet need for HDSE among physicians. Diverse and innovative HDSE programming needs to be developed to meet this need. Programming should be developed not only for physicians but also for undergraduate through residency training programs. © 2020 Weeks et al.","Education; Healthcare delivery science; Management; Policy; Rurality","article; education program; health care delivery; human; human experiment; leadership; perception; physician; questionnaire; residency education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092451432

The research shows that under the conditions of different development levels, country size plays a huge role in technology innovation. Among them, for the developed countries, the market size plays an important role in promoting their technology innovation, followed by the trade size. For the developing countries, the trade size is the key factor for the promotion of their technology innovation. The market size has little effect and the population size has a negative impact. On this basis, this paper puts forward some suggestions for the large developing countries to promote technology innovation based on the country size.

The proposed approach contains a multiple-indicator multiple-cause model (MIMIC) with a latent class analysis (LCA). The MIMIC model was used to quantify intrinsic motivations according to individual heterogeneity. From a group similarity perspective, the LCA was employed for the latent classification of drivers. The features and possibility of accepting guidance information of each class were also analyzed according to the intrinsic motivation of drivers. Data were collected from the stated preference online surveys, in which the questionnaire was designed according to the diffusion of innovation, in 2015 and 2019 in China. Four subjective perceptions of drivers were identified: the perception of innovating guidance information, the perception of convenience regarding guidance information transmission, the perception of surrounding complexity, and the individual innovation. The estimation results show that age, driving experience, education levels, and familiarity with road network are significant factors of compliance behavior. The proportion of conservatives gradually decreased from 2015 to 2019, while the proportion of early followers and late followers increased through market penetration, familiarity with the Internet of vehicles, and social networks in the same period. This prevalence demonstrates that guidance information at signalized intersections is gradually becoming acceptable in China. © 2020 Xiaomei Zhang et al.",,"Behavioral research; Life cycle; Motivation; Surveys; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Diffusion of innovations; Driving experiences; Guidance information; Intrinsic motivation; Latent class analysis; Multiple indicators; Signalized intersection; Subjective perceptions; Air navigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089306330

Objectives: The aim of this study was to compute the relative data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency for a set of developed and emerging market (EM) countries using widely accepted trade and logistics infrastructure components. Global logistics remains an integral component of macroeconomics when studying the potential of developed and EM growth. The study investigated the relative and relevant trade, logistics infrastructure and market potential performance. Method: The methodological approach adopted in this study combined DEA efficiency and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for country-level comparisons. We incorporated trade export and import ratios for common sectors as trade performance proxies. Two important hypotheses were proposed in the study. Results: We showed several important results. Firstly, there was clear evidence that EM countries were just as efficient as developed markets despite the scale or size differences between these country groups. Secondly, efficient countries seemed to produce better trade performance outcomes. Thirdly, relative to predicting customs duty revenues, reliable infrastructure mattered. Conclusion: The evidence from our DEA and OLS analyses conducted suggests important relationships between logistics infrastructure, market potential and trade outcomes performance (as measured by customs duties and import and export ratios). Our data on 89 countries result in guidance for infrastructure improvement areas and linkages between market potential components and import and export ratios across key industry sectors. © 2020.

The standard information-Aggregation techniques exacerbate p-hacking by increasing the probability of the type I error. We propose an aggregation technique that is a simple modification of three-pass regression filter/ partial least squares regression with an opposite property: The predictability tests applied to the combined predictor become more conservative in the presence of p-hacking. Using simulations, we quantify the advantages of our approach relative to the standard information-Aggregation techniques. We also apply our aggregation technique to three sets of return predictors proposed in the literature and find that the forecasting ability of combined predictors in two cases cannot be explained by p-hacking. © 2019 INFORMS.","3prf; Forecast Combination; P-Hacking; Pls; Predictability Of Returns","Investments; Least squares approximations; Aggregation techniques; Forecasting ability; Information aggregation; Partial least squares regression; Regression filters; Simple modifications; Standard information; Stock returns; Personal computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083031051

However, such plans could be counterproductive if enough participants (especially those who do not win) perceive that subjectivity (introduced via discretion) adds unfairness.

Using a large data set of executives in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, in a region with some of the lowest rates of female labour force participation in the world, I present new evidence of a setting in which foreign firms do not capture opportunity in the local labour market. I find that foreign firms, on average, are not more likely than local firms to hire female executives and are less likely to place women into top management roles.

Literature review: Review of the literature on the centrality of communication in leadership processes and conformity behavior suggest a void of analytic tools to adequately examine the negative consequences of discursive leadership. Research question: Are later interlocutors more likely to speak similarly to earlier ones if the earlier interlocutors occupy a more central position in the conversation network? Methodology: Based on 32,000 words of a transcribed meeting corpus, we measured conformity behaviors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency scores, which are widely used in the information retrieval setting. We also operationalized the strength of discursive leadership as a positional centrality measure in the conversation network using a matrix algebra approach in social network analysis. Results: Findings support the hypothesis that discursive leadership is associated with conformity in language aligned toward discursive leaders' opinions. Conclusions: This study makes theoretical advances in understanding leadership construction and conformity behaviors between leaders and followers using empirical, authentic meeting data. We also give business people an applied understanding of the process of discursive leadership, which may help them to improve communication efficacy in their organizations by reducing overly conforming behaviors. We recommend that future research include more diverse participants and be combined with a survey to supplement the conversation data. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Business meetings; conformity; discursive leadership; language similarity; social network analysis","Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Text processing; Analytic tools; Business meetings; Centrality measures; Literature reviews; Professional communication; Research questions; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096868416

The occupational safety and health administration regulations state that employers must make safety data sheets available for employees. When firms use hundreds of chemicals, tracking their safety data sheets becomes difficult. Safety Data Sheet Management Systems are developed to track safety data sheets. This paper aims to propose a multi-attribute decision-making framework for selecting a Safety Data Sheet Management System. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 12 attributes are proposed based on a real-life project conducted at a firm in New York and the software selection models existed in the literature. Fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is used to assess the proposed attributes and alternatives. A case study and sensitivity analysis are conducted to show the robustness of the proposed model. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is used for validation. Findings: Safety Data Sheet Management System is important for firms to track and manage safety data sheets. The proposed framework is practical and easy to implement. Practical implications: The proposed decision model is useful for firms to select a proper Safety Data Sheet Management System. The system developers can use the model to update their systems.

We introduce a theoretical framework which shows that under reasonable assumptions, shifting from a per-machine licence fee to a gross profits tax (GPT) on machine revenue can help to resolve policy tensions between industry profitability, economic growth and government revenue. We test the theory using data on recent changes to gambling taxation in the UK, in particular the move to a gross profits-based Machine Games Duty (MGD). Our results reveal that the shift from licence fees to a revenue-neutral MGD led to a significant increase in the number of machines, as predicted by the theory, and in machine revenue.

However, very few researches have investigated the impact of industry agglomeration from the perspective of spatial distribution of firms and mutual effects between firms. This paper uses a network-based, within-city approach to shed new light on the impact of industry agglomeration. Based on a data set that includes records of all Chinese industrial firms from 1998 to 2007, we construct a network of firms for each prefectural level city and characterize within-city industry agglomeration using principal components obtained from network-based measurements and dimension reduction. Those characterizations allow us to examine the impact of industry agglomeration on total factor productivity through panel data regression. We obtain three principal components: modularity, scale, and diversity to characterize city-level industry agglomeration. Panel data regression reveals that all three principal components are significantly, positively related to a city’s total factor productivity. However, as the scale of firms in a city increases, the impact of agglomeration decreases. Meanwhile, relative to the impact of modularity and scale, the impact of diversity on TFP is weaker. © 2020 International Chinese Association of Quantitative Management.","Industry agglomeration; network structure; productivity","Industrial relations; Operations research; Data set; Dimension reduction; Mutual effects; Network-based; Network-based approach; Panel data; Principal Components; Total factor productivity; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085370139

Cognitive ability and personality traits are also included as additional explanatory variables. Design/methodology/approach: The logistic regression technique was applied using a sample of more than 2,300 microfinance institutions' clients in three provinces in Indonesia. Findings: This study finds that financial literacy correlates positively with authority in household financial decision-making only among men. This does not mean that financial literacy is irrelevant for women's agency, since the skill might be important for authorities in other decision-making areas, including those outside households. Meanwhile, the relationship between cognitive ability and household financial decision-making authority is more universal. Research limitations/implications: This study does not collect information on the levels of financial literacy of other household members and does not capture respondents' perceptions of household financial decision-making. Social implications: The overall low level of financial literacy calls for the need for more targeted efforts to address this issue by policymakers. Education policy should also be designed to improve cognitive ability, as this ability is important for human agency and well-being.

However, despite these long-held beliefs, there is little consensus in the literature regarding how to measure the business value created by increased investment in information technology. Variability in firm type and individual organizational goals, data availability, and other factors may explain the lack of consensus in measurement.

Specifically, the paper attempts to determine the factors that drive technology spending and the outcomes of information technology spending for P&C insurance firms.

For this research, the authors are defining the 'skills gap' as the distance between the position requirements and the skills currently possessed by the worker in that position. While multiple models have been created over the years to address facets of the problem, none of them provide a comprehensive framework to clearly identify the required skills and worker qualifications and then evaluate the degree of similarity. A composite skills gap model has been developed using the design science research method (DSRM) to combine elements of previous models and to ensure that the resulting model met a set of established criteria. The skills gap analysis model (SGAM) was evaluated using demonstration data to ensure that it provided a single taxonomy, for both position requirements and the worker qualifications, the resulting descriptions were quantifiable and comparable, the data was accurate and actionable, the model framework is adaptable to any domain, and it is easy to use and not time consuming. The framework provided by the SGAM model establishes a theoretical foundation for skills gap analyses that allows for more analytical research in this area. By utilizing the SGAM to identify position requirements and worker qualifications, organizations can move personnel to better-suited positions or utilize needed training in the specific areas identified. As technology moves toward increasing automation, robotics and artificial intelligence, this type of model can identify what skills are necessary for 'retooling' the workforce to meet the needs to support these systems. © 1973-2011 IEEE.","Design science research method (DSRM); gap analysis; job fit; skills gaps","Engineering; Management; Analysis models; Analytical research; Degree of similarity; Design-science researches; Model framework; Skills gaps; Theoretical foundations; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089289190

This paper proposes a novel measure of universal banking constructed using the relative contribution of each operating segment to total assets using an entropy approach. We here propose a novel dataset containing the Universal Banking Index (UBI) at both country and bank levels. Using a sample of international banks, we evaluate the extent to which our proposed metric affects banks’ profitability, stability, liquidity and capitalisation. Results suggest that a higher degree of diversification is associated with increased stability. In addition, banks that feature a more diversified business model, as proxied by the UBI, are also better capitalised, as opposed to banks with high noninterest income share. Our results suggest that regulatory-induced restriction on universal banking may indeed reduce the benefits of risk sharing across operating segments, exposing banks to heightened risks. © 2020 Board of Trustees of the Bulletin of Economic Research and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","financial products diversification; globalization; Universal banking","banking; business development; capital; financial market; financial system; globalization; profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089084076

The hierarchical linear modeling results supported that individual-level incivility negatively related to career satisfaction but not productivity. Further, department-level incivility moderated the negative effects of individual-level incivility such that the negative effects of individual-level incivility on career satisfaction and productivity were reduced when most people in the department experienced incivility or when individuals were not singled out for being mistreated.

In the years, emerging economies have shown great growth potential and have attracted significant foreign direct investment, especially from companies willing to set up operations. Despite such a seemingly favourable trade environment, not all companies that entered an emerging economy have been successful. Thus, there is a need to understand the factors that influence the success of any offshore location decision. It is also important to understand the relative importance of these factors, in order to develop novel insights useful to practitioners. There is a lack of literature addressing this issue, which this study aims to fill. We conducted a multi-case analysis with examples of European companies entering India. The findings indicate that successful companies employed locally focused business strategies that enabled them to acquire important relationships and knowledge, and also to adapt to formal institutions, including governmental and regulatory procedures. It was found that, irrespective of size, disregarding collaborative strategies was the main reason for exiting India. These findings are highly relevant for managers and policy makers. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emerging economies; institutional theory; location decision; offshoring","Economics; Failure (mechanical); Location; Offshore oil well production; Collaborative strategies; Emerging economies; Foreign direct investments; Institutional factors; Institutional theory; Location decisions; Off-shoring; Offshore locations; Decision theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073825697

Instead of following from the stands or on television fans are choosing to follow, for example, via social media. The emerging unified theory of brand equity offers a framework to examine the mediating role of attendance and local television and the moderating role of Twitter followers on the relationships between MLB marketing assets (MA) and team financial performance. Publicly available secondary data are analyzed with PLS-SEM. The results indicate attendance and local TV partially mediate the relationship between non-seasonal MA and team financial performance, whereas attendance and local TV fully mediate the relationship between in-season MA and team financial performance. Furthermore, the number of Twitter followers for each MLB team moderates various relationships within the MLB brand equity research model. Findings suggest MLB sales and marketing professionals should design ticket sales initiatives that not only promote attendance in the short-term but, more importantly, build upon non-seasonal sources of team brand equity for the long-term. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Analytics; Brand equity; Sales; Social media; Sports marketing; Structural equation modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088323170

The seller determines not only the timing and quantities of the inventory replenishment, but also the selling prices over time. While similar ideas of market segmentation and intertemporal price discrimination can be carried over from the travel industries to other industries, inventory replenishment considerations common to retail outlets and supermarkets introduce additional features to the optimal pricing scheme. Specifically, our study provides concrete managerial recommendations that are against the conventional wisdom on “everyday low price” (EDLP) versus “high-low pricing” (Hi-Lo). We show that in the presence of inventory costs and strategic customers, Hi-Lo instead of EDLP is optimal when customers have homogeneous valuations. This result suggests that because of strategic customer behavior, the seller obtains a new source of flexibility—the ability to induce customers to wait—which always leads to a strictly positive increase of the seller's profit. Moreover, the optimal inventory policy may feature a dry period with zero inventory, but this period does not necessarily result in a loss of sales as customers strategically wait for the upcoming promotion. Furthermore, we derive the solution approach for the optimal policy under heterogeneous customer valuation setting. Under the optimal policy, the replenishments and price promotions are synchronized, and the seller adopts high selling prices when the inventory level is low and plans a discontinuous price discount at the replenishment point when inventory is the highest. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","dynamic pricing; mechanism design; strategic customer","Costs; Economics; Tourism industry; Discontinuous prices; Economic order quantity; Forward-looking customers; Inventory policies; Inventory replenishment; Market segmentation; Price discrimination; Strategic customer behaviors; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086229342

Demand is a price-dependent Poisson process whose mean is the product of buyers’ arrival rate, which is a constant λ, and buyers’ purchase probability q(p) , where p is the price. The seller observes arrivals and sales, and knows neither λ nor q. Based on a non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimator of (λ, q) , we construct an estimator of mean demand and show that as the system size and number of prices grow, it is asymptotically more efficient than the maximum likelihood estimator based only on sale data. Based on this estimator, we develop a pricing algorithm paralleling (Besbes and Zeevi in Oper Res 57:1407–1420, 2009) and study its performance in an asymptotic regime similar to theirs: the initial inventory and the arrival rate grow proportionally to a scale parameter n. If q and its inverse function are Lipschitz continuous, then the worst-case regret is shown to be O((log n/ n) 1 / 4). A second model considered is the one in Besbes and Zeevi (2009, Section 4.2), where no arrivals are involved; we modify their algorithm and improve the worst-case regret to O((log n/ n) 1 / 4). In each setting, the regret order is the best known, and is obtained by refining their proof methods. We also prove an Ω (n- 1 / 2) lower bound on the regret. Numerical comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives indicate the effectiveness of our arrivals-based approach. © 2020, The Author(s).","Asymptotic analysis; Asymptotic efficiency; Estimation; Exploration–exploitation; Regret","Asymptotic analysis; Costs; Estimation; Inverse problems; Maximum likelihood estimation; Sales; Asymptotic efficiency; Asymptotic regimes; Demand uncertainty; Lipschitz continuous; Maximum likelihood estimator; Numerical comparison; Pricing algorithm; Regret; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079419806

These studies often analyze the average relationship between these economic growth takeoffs and total trade flows. Therefore, these studies are somewhat limited because the average relationship masks the potential heterogeneous impact of takeoffs on different levels of the trade distribution. Moreover, endogeneity issues due to a possible bidirectional relationship between trade openness and economic growth also need to be considered. In this paper, we use two quantile regression models—both models allow for panel data and fixed effects, while one also makes use of instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns. As such, we investigate whether takeoffs affect countries equally when they trade at the lower end of the distribution (countries that trade less with each other) compared to those at the higher end of the distribution (countries that trade more with each other). Our results suggest that economic growth takeoffs affect countries at the lower end of the export distribution (10th percentile) significantly more compared to higher end of the export distribution (90th percentile). Moreover, these results are driven entirely by the extensive margin. We also find evidence that takeoffs affect countries with a lower level of income much more compared to those with a high level of income, with this result also extending to the extensive margin. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic growth; Extensive margin; Intensive margin; International trade; Quantile regression","data set; economic growth; panel data; regression analysis; trade flow; trade performance; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061730472

Specifically, we analyze a platform-based market where consumers search and purchase products that potentially differ in quality. In addition, consumers have idiosyncratic tastes for a product, and the extent of this heterogeneity may vary from one product to another. In other words, there may be products with low taste dispersion (products for which there is less heterogeneity among consumers), as well as products with high taste dispersion. Our modeling framework elucidates how platform recommendation influences the market-level equilibrium outcomes, thereby informing the optimal recommendation strategy. We find that the quality and taste-dispersion dimensions can interact to affect the overall effectiveness of product-recommendation strategies. Conditioning on taste dispersion, recommending high-quality products increases both producer profits and consumer surplus. Conditioning on quality, recommending high-taste-dispersion products may, however, increase or decrease producer profits, depending on the joint effect of profit margin and purchase probability.

I recall a few situations where statistics made a real difference and reinforced the impact of our discipline on society. Sometimes the difference lay in the insightful analysis and inference enabled by ground-breaking methods in our field like hypothesis testing, likelihood ratios, Bayesian models, jackknife, and bootstrap. But perhaps more often, the impacts came from thoughtful analyses before data were collected, and the questions that arose after the statistical analysis. The impact of understanding the problem, designing the experiment and data collections, conducting the pilot surveys, and raising important questions, is substantial. Through sensible explorations following formal statistical procedures, statisticians have made contributions in many domains. In this presentation, I recall some examples which made a long-lasting impact. Some of them, like randomization in clinical trials, known and familiar to all, are so ingrained in our practice that the role of statistics has been forgotten. Others may be less familiar but nonetheless benefited greatly from the critical input of statisticians.

The dynamics of waiting lists are complex, especially when trying to understand how the lists grow due to the demand of a particular treatment relative to a hospital's capacity. Understanding the uncertainty of forecasting growth/decline of waiting lists could help hospital managers with capacity planning. We address this uncertainty through the use of statistical tolerance intervals, which are intervals that contain a specified proportion of the sampled population at a given confidence level. Tolerance intervals are available for numerous settings, however, the approaches for autoregressive models are far more limited. This article fills that gap and establishes tolerance intervals for general AR(p) models, which may also have a mean or trend component present. A rigorous development of tolerance intervals in this setting is presented. Extensive simulation studies identify that good coverage properties are achieved when the AR process is stationary and the parameters of the AR model are well within the stationarity constraints. Otherwise, a bootstrap-based correction can be applied to improve the coverage probabilities. Finally, the method is applied to the monthly number of patients on hospital waiting lists in England. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bootstrap; capacity planning; coverage probability; forecasting; k-factor; regression","Forecasting; Population statistics; bootstrap; Capacity planning; Coverage probabilities; K factor; regression; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090976925

In order to address such particular business needs, this paper proposes a novel risk-balanced territory planning model for a MFI. The proposed mixed integer programming model lets the MFI choose the location of the branches to be designated as territory centers and allocate the customers to these centers with respect to planning criteria such as the total workload, monetary amount of loans and profit allocation while balancing the territory risk. This model is solved using a branch and cut based hybrid-heuristic framework.

The authors examine the relationship between local government support and market accessibility by using two methods of analysis, viz. OLS regression and the average treatment effect. There are six indices of local government support, covering particular subsidies, joint subsidies for production, and general support. The four indices for market accessibility have been constructed by assigning three-scale and five-scale categorization schemes of the locations of final production in both ascending and descending orders. The authors also find that the government support helps enterprises reduce cost and facilitates the sale of the enterprises’ final product in more distant markets.

Generally, the assessment and valuation process is conducted by an official organization at the nation's governmental level. From a corporation perspective it is thus crucial to calculate an accurate value of the right to exploit a mineral product or what we call “mineral right”. In this work we compare three valuation methods and we compare their results in case of pricing a copper mine in China. We explain and apply the official valuation method based on a simple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). We present what we believe is a more accurate valuation based on the term structure of future mineral prices: the so called modified Discounted Cash Flow (mDCF) method. Finally, we contrast with a method based on real options which considers the mineral right as a swaption. We implement two real options models: the classical Black model and a more modern Miltersen and Schwartz model. We highlight and discuss differences and commonalities between the three valuation methods. Finally, we make a recommendation for future financial reporting based what we learn from the three methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Futures; Mineral rights; Mining valuation; Real options","Copper mines; Costs; Economics; Discounted cash flow; Financial reporting; Futures; Mineral products; Mining valuation; Real Options; Valuation methods; Valuation process; Minerals; comparative study; copper; future prospect; minerals industry; mining industry; price determination; valuation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076246688

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the path relationship of service quality to customer satisfaction to financial sustainability in the water service sector, which is vital to the sustainable future of mankind. Further, these three interrelated constructs and their dimensions are clearly articulated. Design/methodology/approach: SERVQUAL questionnaire responses were collected from 635 household families, and the financial sustainability indicators of 56 water providers were gathered as well. Cronbach's alpha and factor analysis were conducted to measure the internal consistency and convergent validity. Path analysis was utilized to evaluate the causal diagram by examining the relationships among service quality, customer satisfaction and financial sustainability using the AMOS software package. Findings: The results showed that the five dimensions of service quality explain 58% of the customer satisfaction variation. The responsiveness, empathy, assurance and reliability have significant impact on the customer satisfaction where p < 0.05, while the tangible dimension has an insignificant effect. The results also revealed that customer satisfaction has a significant impact on the financial sustainability indicators of the water providers, where p = 0.000 for the debt collection ratio indicator, and p = 0.003 for the financial efficiency ratio indicator. Research limitations/implications: This research on financial sustainability is based on evidence about service quality and customer satisfaction in the Palestinian water sector. Future research on financial sustainability of the water sector may focus on the pricing mechanism and debt collection of water service. Practical implications: The findings suggest that water providers should recognize the importance of service quality dimensions, which strengthen the customer satisfaction, which, in turn, is a significant driver for their financial sustainability. It is, therefore, sound to draw action-oriented managerial implications from these results. Originality/value: The study adds to the literature of water service sector and is based on empirical evidence from primary data of household families and secondary data of water service providers from developing countries.

Our data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based analyses, using publicly available data for the period 1995-2006, indicate that the productivity gains flow from the customers to the suppliers in a supply chain, and moreover, such spillovers are affected by the strength of the relationship (economic bond) between the customer and the supplier. We also find that the customers' productivity has a positive impact on the profitability of the suppliers. Our results demonstrate an additional means of enhancing firm productivity through strategic supply chain partnerships. If such productivity enhancements can accrue to the entire economy, it will be of interest to policy makers.

In this case, IV produces a local average treatment effect (LATE), and if monotonicity does not hold, then no effect of interest is identified. In this paper, I calculate the weighted average of treatment effects that is identified under general first-stage effect heterogeneity, which is generally not the average treatment effect among those affected by the instrument. I then describe a simple set of data-driven approaches to modeling variation in the effect of the instrument. These approaches identify a Super-Local Average Treatment Effect (SLATE) that weights treatment effects by the corresponding instrument effect more heavily than LATE. Even when first-stage heterogeneity is poorly modeled, these approaches considerably reduce the impact of small-sample bias compared to standard IV and unbiased weak-instrument IV methods, and can also make results more robust to violations of monotonicity. In application to a published study with a strong instrument, the preferred approach reduces error by about 19% in small (N ≈ 1, 000) subsamples, and by about 13% in larger (N ≈ 33, 000) subsamples. © 2020 N.

The vertical nature of the investment, with an emphasis on international production net-works that utilise significant levels of foreign inputs, infers protection of intellectual property and a reduction in value added, with results indicating a failure to achieve an export multiplier. There is evidence of substantial benefits accruing to firms in receipt of loans, but the apparent paucity of their availability may imply market failure.

As a complimentary tool, the authors also adopted Tobit regression analysis to identify factors affecting efficiencies and inefficiencies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims to measure the relative efficiency of maintenance performances for a type of USAF aircraft in an effort to enhance aviation safety and combat readiness. Findings: Through this study, the authors have two noteworthy findings. These are (1) an increased number of “cannibalization” (extracting necessary parts from the existing aircraft) practices tended to reduce maintenance efficiency; (2) The number of mission-capable aircraft turned out to be the most important factor for maintenance performance efficiency. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies on aircraft maintenance that considered popular but neglected cannibalization practices as a new variable for assessing the maintenance efficiency. In addition, this paper is one of the few studies that performed a post-ad hoc analysis as a follow-up to DEA analysis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aircraft maintenance performance; Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; Tobit regression",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096294192

If done right, the organisation should thrive with strong productivity and financial performance. If the wrong person is selected, negative issues such as low employee morale and low productivity can lead to poor sales and profits. While experience is an important factor in hiring, some organisations place a disproportionate amount of weight on certain kinds of experience. In particular, this study examined a Fortune 500 firm in North America that anecdotally believed that those individuals with prior experience in sales made better managers. Thus, we quantitatively examined if managers at this firm with prior sales experience produced higher sales revenue, profitability (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation; EBITDA), and return on controllable assets (ROCA) compared to those managers without prior sales experience. The results of our analysis indicate that skill sets, other than those provided by prior sales experience, are necessary for managers to generate and manage revenue.

The client selection decision is arguably the most important stage in this process. The predominant view in the literature is that client selection ought to be carried out using robust selection criteria linked to critical success factors. The results of this research question the value of such approaches. Assessors at incubators do not follow a wholly rational process linking client attributes to critical success factors. Instead, a combination of both rational and non-rational or intuitive processes help assessors chose clients which 'appear' most promising on a range of both written and un-written criteria. Due to limitations inherent in traditional information collection mechanisms, assessors consistently use 'stereotyping' and 'attribute substitution' to make selection decisions. A new 'entrepreneurial readiness' heuristic was discovered and the reasons behind the strategic misalignment between client selection outcomes and incubator service portfolios is explained.

Although fulfilling the requirements of a social innovation initiative and offering large and significant social benefits, the Program cannot be characterised as a social business due to the need of constant Federal Government funding , and also because of the fact that its target group is treated as the program's beneficiary and not as a customer.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the wave and determinants of the brain-drain migration of skilled human capital from China. METHODS: We carried out a survey across a few rural and urban areas in China with 2,077 respondents by using a probability sampling technique. For empirical estimation, we employed the logistic regression estimation technique to compute and evaluate the data. RESULTS: The findings of this study suggest that high wages outside China and low wages within China is the top reason to move out of China. Additionally, more opportunities and better lifestyle away from China are key factors to push skilled human capital from China to host country. The findings of our study also indicate that better education abroad has a positive correlation with the brain-drain migration intention in China. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical results of the survey should be a high concern for the policy makers of China. Most survey respondents were young, well-educated and highly skilled, they identified several critical reasons that compel them to migrate from China. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Data indicate that participant teachers utilized simulations to: enhance students’ ability to critically engage with social studies content, facilitate more democratic dialogue, and critique normalized systems of power. We do not suggest that simulations in and of themselves are “critical,” rather, we argue they can be an effective means of providing a safe environment for considering the complexities of certain issues in social studies. Furthermore, we argue critical social studies teachers and teacher educators can be purposeful in their use of simulation to avoid enshrining the status quo. Finally simulations can help critical teachers illuminate oppression and facilitate a more humanizing vision within the social studies if they possess critical consciousness, strong pedagogical content knowledge and a command of the method. © The Author(s) 2020.","citizenship; consiousness; critical pedagogy; dialogue; economics; history; ideology; simulations; social studies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089183006

It is often a challenging decision for companies to determine the appropriate level of dividend for the shareholders. While some past studies argue that microeconomic factors drive the decision of dividend policies, many other researchers claim that it is the macroeconomic factors of a country which ultimately influence the dividend payouts. However, there is a paucity of research in this area for emerging countries like Bangladesh. This study thus examines impacts of a set of pre-determined microeconomic and macroeconomic factors upon cash dividend payouts by analysing a sample of listed firms of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), Bangladesh. Findings are analysed based on liquidity, leverage, growth, and size of the sample firms for microeconomic factors; while, macroeconomic factors are analysed upon dividends on an average basis.

Specifically, it utilizes the sign-restrictions structural vector autoregressions (VAR) to examine whether green tax is growth-enhancing or growth-inhibiting. Using data on the Danish economy for the period 1975-2017, the results reveal that green tax shocks trigger opposite movements in non-renewable and renewable energy consumption, and a mild transitory decrease in economic growth. The study also compares green tax shocks in the pre-and post-Carbon tax periods and finds that how the Danish economy experiences green tax shocks has not fundamentally changed since the introduction of Carbon tax in 1992. Taken together, the findings suggest that green tax is effective in increasing reliance on renewable energy while decreasing non-renewable energy consumption without seriously inhibiting economic growth. © 2020, Econjournals.

Today, many emergent and large-scale digital systems display weaknesses parallel to immature systems of the past. System builders need to learn from campaigns that created productivity-driving systems in the past and in recent years and build highly effective large systems for our future.
