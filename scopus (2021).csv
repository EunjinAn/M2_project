The proposed tests are based on the average of pair-wise correlation coefficients of the OLS residuals from the individual regressions in the panel and can be used to test for cross-sectional dependence of any fixed order p, as well as the case where no a priori ordering of the cross-sectional units is assumed, referred to as CD (p) and CD tests, respectively. Asymptotic distribution of these tests is derived and their power function analyzed under different alternatives. It is shown that these tests are correctly centred for fixed N and T and are robust to single or multiple breaks in the slope coefficients and/or error variances. The small sample properties of the tests are investigated and compared to the Lagrange multiplier test of Breusch and Pagan using Monte Carlo experiments. It is shown that the tests have the correct size in very small samples and satisfactory power, and, as predicted by the theory, they are quite robust to the presence of unit roots and structural breaks. The use of the CD test is illustrated by applying it to study the degree of dependence in per capita output innovations across countries within a given region and across countries in different regions. The results show significant evidence of cross-dependence in output innovations across many countries and regions in the World. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cross-sectional dependence; Diagnostic tests; Dynamic heterogenous panels; Empirical growth; Spatial dependence","correlation; economic growth; error analysis; experimental study; innovation; Monte Carlo analysis; panel data; spatial analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085312506

The few applied ongoing use cases include blockchain for food, healthcare, and logistics supply chains have emphasized blockchain's untapped potential. Potential support for supply chain and sustainability issues include improving efficiency, transparency, and traceability in addition to billions of dollars in corporate financial savings. Given its promise, the adoption of blockchain technology, although hyped for years, has not seen rapid acceptance. In this study, the technology-organization-environment framework and force field theories are utilized to investigate blockchain adoption barriers. Using various literature streams on technology, organizational practices, and sustainability, a comprehensive overview of barriers for adopting blockchain technology to manage sustainable supply chains is provided. The barriers are explored using technology, organizational, and environmental – supply chain and external – framework followed by inputs from academics and industry experts and then analyzed using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) tool. The results show that supply chain and technological barriers are the most critical barriers among both academics and industry experts. We further determine the similarities and differences among academics and practitioners in perceiving the barriers. This exploratory study reveals interesting relative importance and interrelationships of barriers which are necessary, theoretically and practically for further adoption and dissemination of blockchain technology in a sustainable supply chain environment. It also sets the stage for theoretical observations for understanding blockchain technology implementation in sustainable supply chains.

However, the literature on driving factors of the ecological footprint indicates diverse findings, and the majority of the studies explore symmetric relationships. Taking this in view, the current study uses both symmetric and asymmetric methods to examine the nexus between ecological footprint, economic globalization, economic growth, and financial development, controlling for population density and energy consumption in the third-largest economy Japan. The study uses advanced unit root methods including the Narayan-Popp and CMR unit root tests with two breaks to determine unit root properties. The asymmetric and symmetric ARDL methods are used to probe cointegration and long-run associations. The findings reveal the long-run asymmetric and symmetric relationship of variables with the ecological footprint. The long-run empirical results of symmetric ARDL suggest that economic globalization and financial development increase footprint in Japan. On the flipside, the novel findings from the asymmetric ARDL indicate that positive and negative changes in economic globalization reduce footprint. Interestingly, the asymmetric ARDL presents a totally different picture, indicating that the results of symmetric ARDL can be unreliable in the presence of asymmetries. A positive change in financial development increases footprint with a more pronounced effect in the long-run, compared to a negative change which has a comparatively weak effect. Energy consumption deteriorates the environment by increasing the ecological footprint. On the positive side, population density decreases footprint, and the inverted U-shaped relationship between footprint and income confirms the validity of the EKC in Japan. Finally, the policy implications of these novel findings are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological footprint; Economic globalization; Economic growth; Financial development; Symmetric & asymmetric ARDL","Deterioration; Ecology; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Finance; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Ecological footprint; Economic globalization; Economic growths; Environmental deterioration; Financial development; Policy implications; Population densities; Positive changes; Public policy; asymmetry; ecological footprint; economic development; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental indicator; globalization; income; population density; symmetry; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092611799

In circular economy-based models, the resources stay in the system as it experiences one of the 10 R (Refuse, Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle, and Recover) processes. These 10 R processes require the development of advanced manufacturing capabilities; however, 10 R processes suffer from various challenges and can be effectively overcome through Industry 4.0 technological applications. Although literature has indicated the use of various Industry 4.0 technologies, little information is available about firms’ views on the degree of Industry 4.0 application in the 10 R based advanced manufacturing area and its ability to achieve sustainable development. The current study aspires to examine how great an effect Industry 4.0 adoption has on 10 R advanced manufacturing capabilities and its outcome on sustainable development under the moderating effect of an Industry 4.0 delivery system. Practice-based view and Dynamic capability view theories are used to conceptualise the theoretical model. The research team statistically validated the theoretical model considering 124 data points that were collected using an online survey with a structured questionnaire. The findings point out that the path degree of Industry 4.0 adoption and 10 R advanced manufacturing capabilities are statistically significant. 10 R advanced manufacturing capabilities are found to have a positive influence on sustainable development outcomes.

The first approach is based on covariance, and the second one is based on variance (partial least squares). It further assesses the difference between PLS and Consistent PLS algorithms. To assess the same, empirical data is used. Four hundred sixty-six respondents from India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the USA, and few other countries are considered. The structural model is tested with the help of both approaches. Findings indicate that the item loadings are usually higher in PLS-SEM than CB-SEM. The structural relationship is closer to CB-SEM if a consistent PLS algorithm is undertaken in PLS-SEM. It is also found that average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) values are higher in the PLS-SEM method, indicating better construct reliability and validity. CB-SEM is better in providing model fit indices, whereas PLS-SEM fit indices are still evolving. CB-SEM models are better for factor-based models like ours, whereas composite-based models provide excellent outcomes in PLS-SEM. This study contributes to the existing literature significantly by providing an empirical comparison of all the three methods for predictive research domains.

Though, the Chinese government has successfully utilized solar energy resources to overcome these issues. However, studies focusing on assessing consumers’ willingness to utilize solar energy are scarce in the country. This study aims to address this research gap by analyzing the influence of factors on consumers’ willingness to utilize solar energy for household purposes. Combined with the existing consumers’ intention factors, the study has also contributed by augmenting the theoretical mechanism of the Theory of Planned Behavior by including three novel factors (perception about self-effectiveness, belief of solar energy benefits, and perception of neighbors’ participation) to comprehensively analyze the willingness of Chinese consumers. Analysis is performed on questionnaire data of 355 households in the four largest cities of Hunan province, such as Changsha, Hengyang, Yueyang, and Zhuzhou, by accompanying an inclusive survey. Structural Equation Modeling has been employed to evaluate and scrutinize the formulated suppositions. The findings disclose that the intention factors, i.e., perception about self-effectiveness, environmental concern, awareness of solar energy, and belief of solar energy benefits impart positive effects on consumers’ willingness to utilize solar energy, while, cost of solar energy has a negative effect. Notably, perception of neighbors’ participation has an insignificant effect. Research outcomes emphasize transforming social norms, raise consumers’ awareness, redesign policy frameworks, and highlight the paybacks that solar energy offers by integrative and consistent efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Consumers; Solar energy; Structural equation modeling; Theory of planned behavior","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Fossil fuels; Surveys; Sustainable development; Chinese Government; Environmental concerns; Policy framework; Questionnaire data; Research outcome; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable growth; Theory of Planned Behavior; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099793945

Few studies have been given to macro-level aggregate analysis through national scale MSW recycling, environmental, and economic indicators. This study employs bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag modeling for investigating the cointegration relationship among MSW recycling, economic growth, carbon emissions, and energy efficiency utilized quarterly data from 1990 to 2017. The result implies that a one percent increase in MSW recycling contributes to economic growth and reduce carbon emissions by 0.317% (0.157%) and 0.209% (0.087%) in the long-run (short-run). Similarly, a one percent improvement in energy efficiency stimulates economic growth by 0.489% (0.281%) and mitigates carbon emissions by 0.285% (0.197%) in the long-run (short-run). A higher per capita income and population growth caused higher emissions by 0.197% and 0.401% in the long-run. The overall results reveal stronger impacts in the long-run than the short-run with significant convergence towards long-run equilibrium, suggesting a prominent long-run transmission of economic and environmental fallouts. This study confirms a uni-directional causality from MSW recycling to economic growth, carbon emissions, and energy efficiency. These outcomes signify that any policy intervention related to MSW recycling produces significant changes in the level of economic growth and carbon emissions. The finding provides valuable insight for policymakers to counteract carbon emissions through recyclable waste management that simultaneously create significant economic value. © 2020","Bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag; Carbon emissions; Economic growth; Energy efficiency; Municipal solid waste recycling","Carbon; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Population statistics; Recycling; Waste management; Aggregate analysis; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Cointegration relationship; Economic indicators; Environmental quality; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Per capita income; Policy intervention; Municipal solid waste; bootstrapping; carbon emission; economic growth; energy efficiency; environmental quality; municipal solid waste; recycling; Article; bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag; carbon footprint; causality; economic development; energy yield; environmental impact; income; municipal solid waste; policy; population growth; recycling; statistical analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098507475

The consumption-based material footprint is trade-adjusted domestic resource consumption that presents an accurate picture of the domestic material footprint. Pursuing the same, this study draws asymmetric linkages between infrastructure development, green innovation, and consumption-based material footprint (MF) in the top 11 highly material-consuming countries. Our preliminary findings strictly reject the preposition of data normality and highlight that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using linear methodologies. In compliance, a novel empirical estimation technique popularized as Method of Moments Quantile Regression is employed that simultaneously deal with non-normality and structural changes in data. The results exhibit that infrastructure development (green innovation) significantly increases (decreases) MF mainly across medium to higher quantiles (medium-higher level of MF). Interestingly, the resource-depleting effect of infrastructure is highest for higher quantiles and lowest for lower quantiles of MF. Economic growth (globalization) increase MF, and their resource-depleting effect is higher (lowest) for lower quantiles and lowest (highest) for higher quantiles. Lastly, population exhibits an inverted-U shape relationship with MF across lower to higher quantiles.

The E7 member countries have partaken in policies to mitigate against global warming in terms of decoupling CO2 emission from economic growth trajectory in the highlighted economies. It is on this premise that the present study is motivated to consider the connection among economic growth, pollutant emissions, coal rent while accounting for the role of other co-variates such as CO2 damage and energy from a nuclear energy source, oil gas energy between 1990 and 2016 on an annual frequency. This study adopts the use of panel ordinary least squares alongside panel quantile regression to explore the coal rent-energy and environment nexus. The empirical result shows a positive and significant effect of both real GDP and coal rent on CO2 emissions. More precisely, a 1% increase in GDP growth increases pollution emission by 0.400% while for coal rent, an increase in coal consumption dampens environmental quality by 0.088% as reported by the panel regression which is resonated by the quantile regression estimations at different tails of the data. Nevertheless, we observe that 0.95 percentile GDP growth strongly contributes to environmental pollution while at the median tail i.e. 0.5 percentile renewable energy consumption dampens the adverse effect of environmental degradation. Additionally, renewable energy, on the other hand, was found a negative and significant impact on CO2 emissions in E7 countries as a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality by 0.588% Moreover, the estimated results indicate that regulation of coal consumption through the rent in addition to the cost of carbon damage will further increase the CO2 emissions in E7 countries. This study implies that putting stringent regulations on coal consumption as it concerns the increasing cost of carbon damage will not be of help to environmental sustainability within the E7 economies. The adoption of renewable energy consumption, nuclear energy, oil energy will reduce CO2 emissions in E7 countries. Thus, suggesting a paradigm shift for low-carbon energy sources which are more environmentally friendly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 pollution; Coal rents; Energy utilization; Environmental sustainability; Regulatory quality and E7 countries","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Nuclear energy; Pollution; Sustainable development; Energy and environment; Environmental pollutions; Environmental quality; Environmental sustainability; Nuclear energy sources; Ordinary least squares; Renewable energy consumption; Stringent regulations; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101584584

The study reveals that COVID-19 information overload through social media had a negative impact on Gen Z social media users’ psychological well-being. Moreover, perceived information overload heightened both social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19, which, in turn, increased users’ social media discontinuance intention. In addition, considering that social media is the predominant method of maintaining connectivity with others for Gen Z users during the lockdown, the fear of missing out (FoMO) buffered the impact of social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 on Gen Z users’ social media discontinuance intention.

To date, empirical evidence to support this theoretical notion as a systemic aspect of the global economy is largely lacking. Through environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output modelling, we provide empirical evidence for ecologically unequal exchange as a persistent feature of the global economy from 1990 to 2015. We identify the regions of origin and final consumption for four resource groups: materials, energy, land, and labor. By comparing the monetary exchange value of resources embodied in trade, we find significant international disparities in how resource provision is compensated. Value added per ton of raw material embodied in exports is 11 times higher in high-income countries than in those with the lowest income, and 28 times higher per unit of embodied labor. With the exception of embodied land for China and India, all other world regions serve as net exporters of all types of embodied resources to high-income countries across the 1990–2015 time period. On aggregate, ecologically unequal exchange allows high-income countries to simultaneously appropriate resources and to generate a monetary surplus through international trade. This has far-reaching implications for global sustainability and for the economic growth prospects of nations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ecologically unequal exchange; Embodied trade flows; Environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output analysis; International inequality; International trade; Structural equation model","economic growth; exchange rate; global economy; input-output analysis; international trade; sustainability; twenty first century; China; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090221707

Perishable food supply chains (PFSC) perform under higher risks as they struggle against greater wastage and product life cycle issues along with the logistics, operational, financial, and health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. While facing these contingencies, it is essential to formulate strategies in real-time. In this paper, we identify and analyze risk mitigation strategies for PFSC during the current pandemic. We have initially discussed the uncertainties and risks related to pandemic situations and subsequently identified risk mitigation strategies to manage PFSC in such situations. We prioritized the identified strategies using the fuzzy-best worst methodology (F-BWM). The BWM is a highly effective decision-making method with higher consistency. The fuzzy extension to the best worst method (BWM) helps in incorporating vagueness and fuzziness in the decision. As a result, F-BWM is an excellent approach to analyze risk mitigation strategies as the business contingencies in PFSC during this pandemic are unique, with the industry having only a few clear ideas about how best to mitigate them. Among the risk mitigation strategies, “collaborative management,” “proactive business continuity planning,” and “financial sustainability” are the top risk mitigating strategies. Other identified strategies are also extremely useful for varied environmental contingencies. Thus, this research has been underpinned by the contingency theory and discusses all mitigation strategies concerning the socioeconomic contingencies originating from COVID-19. This research is a novel effort in identifying and analyzing the risk mitigation strategies for enhancing the socioeconomic-ecological performance of PFSCs in meeting the sustainable development goal of healthy and safe food for everyone. © 2021","COVID-19; Fuzzy-best worst method; Perishable food supply chain; Risk mitigation; Socioeconomic aspect; Technological advancement","Decision making; Food supply; Health risks; Life cycle; Planning; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Business continuity planning; Collaborative management; Decision-making method; Ecological performance; Financial sustainability; Mitigation strategy; Product life cycles; Risk mitigation strategy; Risk management; COVID-19; disease prevalence; epidemic; food market; food supply; mitigation; pandemic; risk assessment; service provision; social policy; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100414638

Its application in supply chain management is also gradually increasing. Supply chain management (SCM) has long been committed to reducing costs and increasing efficiency and is trying to optimise resources and reduce the sector's fragmentation. Trust has always been an important factor in managing supply chain relationships, and it also affects the efficiency of supply chain operations. To this end, this study aims to examine how trust is affected by the introduction of blockchain technology in construction supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on semi-structured interviews and publicly available information from experts in blockchain and construction supply chain management. Through content analysis, the data are analysed thematically to explore how various types of trust, such as system-based, cognition-based and relation-based, are affected by blockchain technology. Findings: Blockchain technology provides solutions for data tracking, contracting and transferring resources in supply chain management. These applications help enhance the various sources of trust in SCM and provide supply chain partners with protection mechanisms to avoid the risks and costs of opportunistic behaviour in collaboration, shifting trust from relational to system-based and cognition-based. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on inter-organisational rather than interpersonal trust and empirical data from experts whose knowledge and cognition could be subjective. Practical implications: Leveraging the potential of digitalisation to manage trust requires that leaders and managers actively try to improve contractual arrangements, information sharing and being open to new innovative technologies like blockchain. Social implications: From a relational view of supply chain management, the extent to which blockchain technology can develop and spread depends on the readiness of the social capital to accept decentralised governance structures. Originality/value: This study builds upon an original data set and discusses features and applications of blockchain technology, explores the sources and dimensions of trust in supply chain management and explains the impact of blockchain technology on trust. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain technology; Construction; Digital; Experience; Supply chain management; Trust","Blockchain; Costs; Efficiency; Information management; Construction supply chain; Construction supply chain management; Contractual arrangements; Design/methodology/approach; Semi structured interviews; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain operation; Supply chain relationships; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084203743

Samples were nationally balanced on age, gender, and ethnicity (total N = 6,281). We find that although risk perception varies between the time points surveyed, it is consistently, significantly, and positively correlated with the reported adoption of protective health behaviours, such as wearing face masks or social distancing. There is also an increase in reported health protective behaviours in the UK between March 2020 and January 2021. The strength of the association between risk perception and behaviour varies by time point, with a stronger relationship in January 2021 compared to March and May 2020. We also assess the stability of the psychological determinants of risk perception over time. People’s prosocial tendencies and individualistic worldviews, experience with the virus, trust in government, science, and medical professionals, as well as personal and collective efficacy all emerged as significant predictors. With few exceptions, these predictors remained consistent in their relationship with risk perception over time. Lastly, we find that psychological factors are more predictive of risk perception than an objective measure of situational severity, i.e. the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of data collection.

Indian Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises are facing the competition posed by rising technological advances in the market. Thus, Industry 4.0 intervention shall be highly useful in this context. This study assesses the barriers involved in implementing Industry 4.0 for sustainable production, and it attempts to find causality among the barriers using the ‘Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory’ method. The study considers eight barriers to implement Industry 4.0 for sustainable production. These barriers are inter-related and have causal relationships among them. This causality is represented graphically. The applied method delineates barriers under consideration for causality into two groups, namely; ‘influencer’ and ‘influenced.’ It also illustrates the strength of the influence of one barrier over the other through numerical values. The prime contribution of this study is to not only find the influencing barriers but also to mitigate them by allocating scarce organizational resources. Mitigating the influencing barriers would help in managing the influenced challenges. ‘Technological upgradation’, ‘lack of policy frameworks’ are the top two barriers that find its place in the hierarchy of importance established by this study. These barriers are also classified into the ‘cause’ group. Also, this study establishes that ‘difficulty in access to credit’ and ‘non-readiness of the workforce’ in adopting Industry 4.0 are ‘influenced’ barriers. This study shall be of importance to the small business practitioners and government analysts in evaluating barriers in implementing sustainable production initiatives using Industry 4.0. With this, Indian Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise needs to upgrade by upskilling young working population for the forthcoming technological revolution of Industry 4.0.

This novel virus has increased the influx of patients in hospitals, and healthcare organisations are facing unprecedented constraints in their operations to deal with increased demand and pressed capacity. Thus, this article evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare systems' demand, resources and capacity and provides research directions. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint article and uses timely information on healthcare operations from both scholars and managers, published by diverse sources during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings: The authors discuss the focus on “flattening the curve of infection” as a measure to protect healthcare, delay the impact of increased demand and reorientate healthcare supply chain practices. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the role of lean practices on managing demand and capacity and improving quality across healthcare operations and supply chain. Finally, the authors suggest research directions on modern operational issues that emerged during this pandemic, such as discussions around the sustainability of lean post-pandemic, “just in time” practices, inventory trade-offs and lack of organisational responsiveness during untenable events. Originality/value: In this article, the authors provide a contemporary assessment of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare operations, underscoring main economic and operational elements that can be affected, such as unforeseen demand, resources and capacity shortage. Therefore, the authors assess that healthcare organisations, practitioners and governments have to anticipate operational and economic impacts and, ultimately, to reassess their plans to deal with such adverse events. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Capacity; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Demand; Healthcare operations; Healthcare system; Infection curve; Lean healthcare; Pandemic; Resources","Economic and social effects; Quality control; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Viruses; Capacity shortage; Design/methodology/approach; Disruptive event; Health-care operations; Health-care system; Healthcare organisations; Operational issues; Supply chain practices; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088133923

However, extant literature on BDA capability has paid limited attention to understanding the enabling role of data-driven insights for supporting decision-making and, consequently, enhancing CE performance. We argue that firms drive decision-making quality through data-driven insights, business intelligence and analytics (BI&A), and BDA capability. In this study, we empirically investigated the association of BDA capability with CE performance and examined the mediating role of data-driven insights in the relationship between BDA capability and decision-making. Data were collected from 109 Czech manufacturing firms, and partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. The results reveal that BDA capability and BI&A are positively associated with decision-making quality. This effect is stronger when the manufacturer utilizes data-driven insights. The results demonstrate that BDA capability drives decision-making quality in organizations, and data-driven insights do not mediate this relationship. BI&A is associated with decision-making quality through data-driven insights. These findings offer important insights to managers, as they can act as a reference point for developing data-driven insights with the CE paradigm in organizations. © 2021","Big data analytics; Big data analytics capabilities; Circular economy; Data-driven insights; Decision-making; Manufacturing firms","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Least squares approximations; Manufacture; Big data analytic capability; Business analytics; Business-intelligence; Circular economy; Data analytics; Data driven; Data-driven insight; Decisions makings; Economy performance; Manufacturing firms; Decision making; data processing; decision making; manufacturing; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110265219

Real-time data mining and pattern detection in high-frequency data can now be carried out at a large scale. Novel analytical practices promise smoother decision-making as part of a more evidence-based and smarter urbanism, while critical voices highlight the dangers and pitfalls of instrumental, data-driven city making to urban governance. Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning. We first develop a theoretical perspective on urban analytics as a practice that is part of a new smart urbanism.

Although technologies and applications of AI have been widely studied and factors that affect AI adoption are identified in existing literature, the impact of success factors on AI adoption remains unknown. Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework to explore the impacts of success factors on AI adoption in telecom industry by integrating the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework and diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory. Particularly, this framework consists of factors regarding external environment, organizational capabilities, and innovation attributes of AI. The framework is empirically tested with data collected by surveying telecom companies in China. Structural equation modeling is applied to analyze the data.

While traditional work-from-home (WFH) programs offer the worker temporal flexibility, work-from-anywhere (WFA) programs offer both temporal and geographic flexibility. WFA should be viewed as a nonpecuniary benefit likely to be preferred by workers who would derive greater utility by moving from their current geographic location to their preferred location. We study the effects of WFA on productivity at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and exploit a natural experiment in which the implementation of WFA was driven by negotiations between managers and the patent examiners' union, leading to exogeneity in the timing of individual examiners' transition from a work-from-home to a work-from-anywhere program. This transition resulted in a 4.4% increase in output without affecting the incidence of rework. We also report results related to a plausible mechanism: an increase in observable effort as the worker transitions from a WFH to a WFA program. We employ illustrative field interviews, micro-data on locations, and machine learning analysis to shed further light on geographic flexibility, and summarize worker, firm, and economy-wide implications of provisioning WFA. Managerial Summary: Work-from-anywhere is an emerging form of remote work, in which workers are awarded geographic flexibility, that is, the flexibility to choose where to live. We study the productivity effects of workers moving from a work-from-home (WFH) to a work-from-anywhere (WFA) regime at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Exploiting a natural experiment, we find that the transition from WFH to WFA resulted in a 4.4% increase in employee output, with no increase in rework. We also report an increase in employee effort after the transition to WFA and document qualitative evidence on how geographic flexibility benefits individual workers and the USPTO (e.g., real estate savings). © 2020 Strategic Management Society","geographic flexibility; geographic mobility; remote work; telecommuting; USPTO; work-from-anywhere","Commerce; Industrial relations; Location; Managers; Patents and inventions; Productivity; Field interviews; Geographic location; Natural experiment; Plausible mechanisms; Real estate; United States Patent and Trademark Office; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096161812

We draw from these related, but discrete discourses, when critically analysing how postfeminist assumptions shape Swedish and UK government policies aimed at expanding women’s entrepreneurship. Despite differing historical antecedents regarding state engagement with equality and welfare regimes, we illustrate how postfeminist assumptions have infiltrated policy initiatives in both cases. This infiltration has, we suggest, suppressed criticisms that in a context of persistent structural discrimination, lack of welfare benefits and contrived aspirational role models, entrepreneurship constitutes a poor career choice for many women.

However, the transition to renewable energy is impossible without massive public renewable energy research and development budgets (RRDD) along with sustained state and federal policies. RRDD in the US showed significant fluctuations over the last three decades and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) was also highly volatile. Based on this backdrop, this study examined the asymmetric impact of RRDD and EPU on CO2 emissions in the US, accounting for structural breaks in data, and controlling for economic growth and FDI. Keeping in view the overwhelming reliance on linear methods in previous studies, both symmetric and asymmetric ARDL approaches are employed for cointegration and long-run results on quarterly data over the period 1985 to 2017. The outcomes from symmetric and asymmetric cointegration tests unfolded only asymmetric cointegration among variables. The long-run findings unveil that a positive change in EPU mitigates emissions but a dominant reduction in CO2 emissions comes from a negative change in EPU. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce EPU to achieve a considerable long-term reduction in CO2 emissions. Surprisingly, positive and negative changes in RRDD do not affect CO2 emissions. Hence, the study could not find any significant reduction in CO2 emissions associated with RRDD, implying that renewable energy technology budgets are not sufficient enough to reduce pollutant emissions. The evidence also confirms that the EKC hypothesis is valid in the US considering RRDD, EPU, and FDI in the model. Finally, the study suggests a significant uplift in RRDD and fiscal policies with more subsidies and tax benefits for the growth of renewable energy sector. Also, stability in the environmental policies, regardless of the economic condition, is necessary to achieve long-term environmental benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Economic policy uncertainty; Renewable energy RD&D budgets","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; % reductions; CO$-2$/ emission; Economic growths; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energy RD&D budget; Renewable energy technologies; Research-and-development budget; Uncertainty; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108008673

Furthermore, when new evaluation units are added, the performance of all the original units must be re-measured, which restricts the evaluation efficiency. In this study, machine learning algorithms were applied to make up for the shortcomings of the data envelopment analysis method. First, a super-efficiency SBM model was used to construct the relative effective frontier, and then machine learning algorithms were used to construct a regression model and establish the absolute effective frontier. After 15 machine learning algorithms were compared, BPNN demonstrated the best performance, and a SuperSBM-DEA-BPNN model was eventually established. The new model has the following advantages: First, compared with the traditional data envelopment analysis method, the absolute effective frontier displays better evaluation; second, compared with the data envelopment analysis and neural network fusion outlined in the previous literature, the new model can better overcome the problems associated with data envelopment analysis, thereby improving the fusion efficiency. Taking the innovation efficiency evaluation of China's regional rural commercial banks for instance, the new model is proven to be more applicable and offers more effective management tools to improve efficiency.

The aim of this study, therefore, is to account for economic complexity index (ECI), Brexit and other crisis episodes in the growth-energy-emissions nexus. Theoretically, the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model is assessed by adopting a One-step System Generalized Method of Moment (Sys GMM) on data for 26 EU member states over the period from 1995 to 2018. For the first time, an EU-macro regional analysis is conducted with and without the UK. Empirical results reveal that an increase in tourism, real GDP per capita, and energy use across the four EU macro regions leads to increase in carbon emission. In some regions, it was observed that tourism, ECI, Brexit, and the Greece bailout have no significant impact on carbon emission. This suggests that the increase in international travel, complexity of the economy, and financial crisis do not accelerate environmental crisis in such regions. However, where such factors are statistically significant, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis both heighten emissions. Particularly, when the UK is excluded, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis increase and reduce emissions, respectively. The EKC hypothesis, however, holds in either scenario. Based on these empirical findings, vital policy directions are suggested for a post-Brexit EU-UK energy and environmental relations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Brexit; Carbon-reduction; CO2 emissions; Economic complexity index; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Environmental sustainability; Greece Bailout crisis","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Method of moments; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Brexit; Carbon reduction; CO$-2$/ emission; Economic complexity index; Economic growths; Energy-consumption; Environmental sustainability; European union; Greece bailout crisis; Tourism industry; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105286980

Improvements in product quality, waste reduction, environmental measures, green product development, and cost optimization have enforced MSMEs to adopt sustainable development approaches. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is one of the robust methods that reduce waste, variation, emission, and energy in any system. It is indispensable to relook the enablers of environmental LSS to assess sustainability through the successful implementation of this eco-friendly approach. In this context, the present study aims to investigate and prioritize the enablers which facilitate the effective implementation of environmental LSS in MSMEs. Extensive literature and expert's opinions are used to investigate the environmental LSS enablers and grouped them as per their appropriate traits using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The final screening of grouped enablers is done through Importance-index analysis and corrected item minus total correlation method. For prioritization of finalized enablers, a robust decision-making technique, Best Worst Method, is employed with a practical case of Indian MSMEs. The research outcomes reveal that strategic-based enablers are leading in nature, followed by environmental-based enablers. Moreover, current results are validated through the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Analytical Network Process.

As a novel phenomenon, it offers potential for innovative theoretical and empirical pathways to a range of business and management research questions. And yet, development into what we might call a “field” of modern slavery research in business and management remains significantly, and disappointingly, underdeveloped. To explore this, we elaborate on the developments to date, the potential drawbacks, and the possible future deviations that might evolve within six subdisciplinary areas of business and management. We also examine the value that nonmanagement disciplines can bring to research on modern slavery and business, examining the connections, critiques, and catalysts evident in research from political science, law, and history. These, we suggest, offer significant potential for building toward a more substantial subfield of research. © The Author(s) 2020.","business; forced labor; history; law; management; modern slavery; political science",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086511939

The study conceptualizes blockchain technology as a dynamic capability that should be possessed by the organization to remain competitive. The factors influencing the blockchain adoption behavior were modeled using the theoretical lens of the Technology Acceptance Model and Technology-organisation-Environment framework. The findings identify competitor pressure, partner readiness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use as the most influencing factors for blockchain adoption. A predictive decision support system was developed using a Bayesian network analysis featuring the significant factors that can be used by the decision-makers for predicting the probability of blockchain adoption in their organization. The prior probability values reported in the study may be used as indicators by the practitioners to predict their blockchain adoption probability. The practitioner will be required to substitute these probability values (high or low), as applicable to their organization to estimate the adoption probability. The use of the decision support system is likely to help the decision-makers to assess their adoption probability and develop future adoption strategies. © 2020","Bayesian network; Blockchain; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; TAM; TOE","Bayesian networks; Blockchain; Decision making; Forecasting; Machine learning; Supply chains; Turing machines; Adoption behavior; Decision makers; Dynamic capabilities; Machine learning techniques; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Prior probability; Technology acceptance model; Decision support systems; Bayesian analysis; decision support system; machine learning; prediction; probability; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099010341

Widespread diffusion and inclusion of information and communication technology (ICT) in modern equipment has advanced the concept of machine autonomy. This study seeks to understand the effect of trust required for elderly people to accept autonomous homecare systems instead of human support. It attempts to reveal how trust and personal characteristics can increase intent to adopt an autonomous system. In this regard, different trust models and literature on human psychology to adopt ICT driven system are explored and analyzed to develop a parsimonious trust disposition model for autonomous system. The study was conducted among elderly and disabled people in retirement homes and rehabilitation centers of different major cities of Ontario, Canada through random sampling by employing both experiment and survey. In the first phase, a structured and designed experiment was conducted in three retirement homes which included 159 elderly people and in two rehabilitation centers which included 20 disabled people. Then a survey-based empirical study was conducted among the same people with the structured questionnaire to answer the questions based on their perceptions of both receiving service from human beings and viewing the video about an autonomous system governed by ambient intelligence. This study reveals that elderly people can be motivated to develop trust in this less-familiar system if they both believe they can operate it and find a sense of belongingness and feelings of social interactivity from this seemingly living machine system. The findings of this study provide clear direction for academics and practitioners. This research indicates that elderly people must have control on using any system in the absence of human support while maintaining a more solitary life in a retirement home. However, the system must be easy to learn and operate. It should also be designed in such a way that can create and impart social feelings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Adoption behavior; Ambient intelligence; Autonomous homecare system; Behavioral intention; Elderly people; Human behavior; Trust","Ambient intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Surveys; Autonomous systems; Designed experiments; Empirical studies; Health-care system; Information and Communication Technologies; Machine intelligence; Personal characteristics; Social interactions; Behavioral research; disability; elderly population; health care; machine learning; retirement; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091967064

In this paper, we formulate an integrated multi-objective optimization model for an extended capacitated sustainable transportation problem in a coal mining industry using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques. The AHP technique is used to estimate the weights of different types of vehicles available for transportation on the basis of all three parameters of sustainability, namely economic, environmental, and corporate social responsibility. The DEA technique is used for calculating efficiency scores of vehicles on various routes of the given transportation network using inputs and outputs considered critical in the industrial sector particularly the mining industry. Furthermore, we reduce dependency on carbon based fuels for transportation leading to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. A fuzzy interactive optimization approach is presented to get preferred compromise transportation solutions including the optimal number of vehicles employed for sustainable transportation. A real-world case of a mining industry in India is discussed to demonstrate applicability of the proposed optimization model and solution method.

Using a nonlinear econometric model and provincial data from 2000 to 2014, this study investigates the direction of technological innovation and structural change for driving China's economic growth. From a national perspective, an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between technological progress and economic growth, revealing a need to shift the technological progress approach from imitation to innovation. Once the turning point is reached, structural upgrading stimulates China's economic growth. Regional heterogeneity is apparent in regional regression. Both energy-saving and environmental conservation technologies positively contribute to the eastern and central regions’ economies, while only environmental conservation technology accelerates the western region's economic development. On structural adjustment, central areas should utilize industrialization and achieve sustainable development, whereas the eastern and western regions do not benefit from industrial structural change.

Some defend that green growth can be achieved without harming economic growth; others argue that it is not possible to respect sustainability if intensive consumption of goods continues to foster economic growth. Our research aims to analyze the role that sustainable technology transfer and sustainable innovations play in green growth and ascertain the impact of green growth on economic growth. We use aggregated country-level data provided by the OECD, including national accounts, population, and environment statistics (including patents) between 1990 and 2013 for 32 countries, corresponding to an unbalanced panel of 591 observations. We estimate econometric models based on dynamic panel methodologies to capture differences that exist over time.

Despite the recognition of its importance, especially brought to the forefront by the challenges of the coronavirus crises, formal research on the contribution of supply chain logistics is less forthcoming. This paper uses data on 130 nations to examine the relative effects of different aspects of supply chain logistics, including overall logistics performance, and the performance of the input and output dimensions of logistics, on economic growth. The results show that improvements in the supply chain logistics performance yield positive growth dividends. Further, the input and output dimensions of logistics performance have positive growth effects, with some quantitative differences. Significantly, the growth impact of logistics performance varies across nations with different growth rates.

But most of the Asian economies have pursued economic growth at the cost of environment and this needs careful analysis. This study focuses on the environmental degradation, measured by ecological footprint, of the 45 resource-rich countries of Asia. It utilizes several panel techniques including the instrumental variable two-stage least square technique over the period from 1990 to 2018, in order to examine the determinants of ecological footprint with significant emphasis on the role of resource rent. Our empirical findings show that natural resource rent is negatively related to ecological footprint. We equally observed a negative nexus between energy security and ecological footprint, indicating that countries need to be secured in terms of energy to reduce the degradation of environment. Our estimates also revealed a non-linear relationship between ecological footprint and economic growth – even though it contrasts the EKC hypothesis. Additionally, while environmental performance index has been observed to promote ecological footprint, population growth reduces environmental sustainability. This study, therefore, offers a roadmap to stakeholders and policymakers regarding the ways to improve the environmental quality in respective economies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological footprint; Energy security; Environmental performance index; Growth; Natural resources","Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy security; Growth (materials); Population statistics; Sustainable development; Ecological footprint; Economic growths; Energy; Environmental performance; Environmental performance indices; Environmental systems; Instrumental variables; Resource rents; Resource-Rich; Two stage least squares; Environmental management; ecological footprint; energy use; environmental degradation; environmental management; environmental quality; performance assessment; sustainability; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109172172

Our empirical results suggest that rewards giving and badges upgrading gamification mechanisms are positively associated with perceived enjoyment and social interaction, which in turn strongly influence consumers’ impulse buying. Moreover, a multi-group analysis and an importance-performance matrix analysis demonstrate that the relative influences of the two gamification mechanisms are contingent upon gender and age.

We analyze information disclosure from four aspects – namely, what information (i.e., information content), from where (i.e., information source), in what format (information presentation format), and how much (the quantity of information). We find all three information sources – providers, platform, and peer consumers – influence consumer purchase behavior. Regarding information posted by providers, we find a concave relationship between room information (i.e. the number of photos and the length of description) and consumer purchase behavior. However, no significant relationship between providers' self-description (texts and photos) and consumer purchase behavior is found. Regarding information posted by platform, both the recommendation from platform and provider verification information positively influence consumer purchase behavior. For provider-consumer interactions information, the providers' high response rate and fast response speed enhance consumer purchase behavior. However, providing connections to providers' social media profiles negatively influences consumers' purchasing behavior.

Each SDG addresses a critical area of sustainable development and is represented with several social, economic, or environmental indicators. As a result of data collection efforts, 17 SDGs are represented with total of over 90 variables following the guidance of United Nation's (UN) recent reports. Using such a high number of variables to create a benchmark score for each of the 35 OECD countries is a challenging and complex task due to the degree of correlation among the indicators and unit of measurement differences. To cope with these challenges, we proposed a Goal-Specific Principal Component Analysis (GS-PCA) approach and compared statistically with the UN reports for experimental validation purpose. It was found that SDG1 No Poverty, SDG7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG17 Partnerships to Achieve the Goal and the group mean of 17 SDGs were found to be improving. On the other hand, SDG4 Quality Education and SDG8 Decent Work and Economic Growth were in decline. The highest performance was observed in SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth (78.06) and the lowest performance was observed in SDG 17 Partnerships to Achieve the Goal (29.93). In addition, substantial differences were observed in the scores and ranks of mediocre and poor performing countries compared to the benchmark reports, while both the results of this study and benchmark reports were found to be strongly positively correlated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Multicollinearity; OECD; Principal component analysis; Sustainability index; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals","Benchmarking; Developing countries; Economics; Planning; Data collection; Degree of correlations; Economic growths; Environmental indicators; Experimental validations; OECD countries; Quality education; Sustainable cities; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097129751

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies are rich in mineral resources, and economic globalization has put them in the spotlight for the developed world. This paper investigates the impact of natural resource abundance, economic globalization, and disaggregated energy consumption on GCC countries' environmental quality by considering urbanization and economic growth from 1990 to 2018, thus filling a gap in the literature. The study applies an advanced econometric approach, a cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) estimator, for short-run and long-run estimation that allows heterogeneity in the slope parameters and dependencies across countries. The findings show that natural resource abundance significantly improves environmental quality, that economic globalization and renewable energy consumption mitigate emission levels in the GCC economies, and that urbanization, economic growth, and non-renewable energy consumption significantly deteriorate environmental quality.

Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these sectors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Anthropocene; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Climate change; Digitalization; Resilience; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability; Systemic risks","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision making; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Extraction; Forestry; Marine applications; Marine biology; Oceanography; Predictive analytics; Sustainable development; Timber; Automated decision making; Cascading failures; Critical questions; Ecological changes; Environmental Monitoring; Governance mechanisms; Marine resources; Sensor technologies; Artificial intelligence; agricultural application; Anthropocene; artificial intelligence; automation; climate change; decision making; digitization; environmental monitoring; forestry; governance approach; marine resource; risk assessment; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114991759

However, there is a lack of research on managers' attitudes and intentions to use AI for decision making. To address this gap, we develop an integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) to consider both the positive and negative factors that collectively influence managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. The research model is tested through a large-scale questionnaire survey of 269 UK business managers. Our findings suggest that IAAAM provides a more comprehensive model for explaining and predicting managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. Our research contributes conceptually and empirically to the emerging literature on using AI for organizational decision-making. Further, regarding the practical implications of using AI for organizational decision-making, we highlight the importance of developing favorable facilitating conditions, having an effective mechanism to alleviate managers’ personal concerns, and having a balanced consideration of both the benefits and the dark side associated with using AI. © 2021 The Authors","AI adoption; Artificial intelligence; Integrated AI acceptance-Avoidance model (IAAAM); Organizational decision-making; Technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT); Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)","Decision making; Managers; Surveys; Behavioral intention; Business managers; Comprehensive model; Effective mechanisms; Facilitating conditions; Organizational decision making; Questionnaire surveys; Research models; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107522534

In this paper, I discuss that emerging literature on gender inequalities in pandemic academic productivity. I reflect on the questions asked, the issues centered and the assumptions made within this literature, devoting particular attention to how authors conceptualize academic labor and productivity, on one hand, and gender, on the other. I show that this literature makes major contributions to exposing old and new gender inequalities in academia, but argue that it also risks reproducing some problematic assumptions about gender and about academic work.

Environmental problems have thus become increasingly prominent, particularly the presence of fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). High-quality and high-resolution PM2.5 data is urgently needed. Therefore, based on the newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth products, a high-quality PM2.5 data set with a high spatial resolution of 1 km is first reconstructed covering 2000 to 2018 in the BTH region using the linear mixed effect (LME) model. This model shows an excellent performance with a high cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85, a small root mean square error of 21.49 μg/m3, and a small mean absolute error of 15.26 μg/m3 from 2013 to 2018. It also has strong predictive power in estimating historical PM2.5 concentrations, with a monthly R2 equal to 0.72. There was a significant decreasing trend (i.e., −1.53 μg/m3, p &lt; 0.01) in PM2.5 concentrations during the last two decades, and the largest downward trend (i.e., −6.83 μg/m3, p &lt; 0.01) occurred from 2013 to 2018. In addition, the response of PM2.5 to the industrial structure is also examined using the vector autoregression model.

Digital transformation and the resulting pervasive digitalization of the innovation function have often been associated with increasing possibilities for search and recombination. In this paper, by systematically integrating the search and recombination literature with the literature on digitalization, we demonstrate that digitalization may engender new idiosyncratic tensions in the organizational antecedents of search and recombination and, by implication, in their likely outcomes. We propose that, depending on the interactions among the idiosyncratic tensions identified herein, knowledge recombination might spur very different outcomes, including knowledge layering, knowledge integration, knowledge grafting, or even no recombination at all (which we label “search for the sake of search”). These outcomes may not always be the initially planned desired outcomes.

Where environmental disclosure has been the focus, though, only single-country studies have been published, and most of the previous research concerns the developed world. This study examines the association between corporate environmental disclosure (CED) and FV in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, where CED has been increasing from its previous low base. Findings from a multicountry sample of 500 firm-year observations using a 55-item unweighted environmental disclosure index suggest that CED is significantly and positively related to FV as measured by Tobin's Q (TBQ). The relationship is robust to using a weighted version of the disclosure index, individual countries and environmental disclosure subindices. Some evidence of a positive relationship between CED and return on assets is also found, but even where statistically significant, the relationship is much weaker than in the case of TBQ. For empirical and theoretical reasons, we recommend that future studies pay greater attention to market-based proxies, if possible, when investigating the value relevance of CED in both developed and developing countries. Our results suggest that both managers and policymakers in GCC countries should take a positive view of expanded CED. © 2020 The Authors.

This study proposes an innovative trip-level inference approach for quantifying the economic benefits of FFBS, leveraging massive FFBS transaction data, the emerging multimodal routing Application Programming Interface from online navigators and travel choice modeling. The proposed approach is able to analyze the economic benefit for every single bike-sharing trip and investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the economic benefits from FFBS. An empirical analysis in Shanghai is conducted using the proposed approach. The estimated saved travel time, cost, and economic benefit due to using FFBS per trip are estimated to be 9.95 min, 3.64 CNY, and 8.68 CNY-eq, respectively. The annual saved travel time, cost, and economic benefits from FFBS in Shanghai are estimated to be 17.665 billion min, 6.463 billion CNY, and 15.410 billion CNY-eq, respectively. The relationships between economic benefits from FFBS and built environment factors in different urban contexts are quantitatively examined using Multiple Linear Regression to explain the spatial heterogeneity in the economic benefits of FFBS. The outcomes provide a useful tool for evaluating the benefits of shared mobility systems, insights into the users’ economic benefit from using FFBS from per-trip, aggregated and spatial perspective, as well as its influencing factors. The results could efficiently support the scientific planning, operation and policy making concerning FFBS in different urban contexts. © 2020","Micro-shared mobility systems; Saved cost; Saved travel time; Spatial variances; Substitution rates","Air navigation; Application programming interfaces (API); Bicycles; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Linear regression; Travel time; Economic benefits; Empirical analysis; Multiple linear regressions; Quantitative assessments; Scientific planning; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal heterogeneities; Travel choice models; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099000289

In so doing, analysis of energy poverty is carried out from five different dimensions, and its nexus with two aspects of income inequality is explored. The empirical analysis strategy entailed panel Granger causality, two-stage least squares, three-stage least squares, and two-step system GMM approaches for the robustness of inferences. Based on data availability, the dataset constituted a global sample of 51 economies from 2002 to 2014. Our key findings suggest that there is significant evidence of Granger causality between energy poverty and income inequality. Notably, an increase in income inequality causes higher energy poverty. In return, a decrease in energy poverty appears to reduce income inequality. The analysis of low- and lower-middle-income economies, as well as upper-middle-income economies, yields consistent auxiliary findings that provide robustness to our analysis and inferences.

This study investigates the extent to which climate change adaptations by smallholder farmers have the potential to contribute to the UN's sustainable development goals of no poverty (SDG 1) and zero hunger (SDG 2). To this end, the study measures the impact of such adaptations on food production using farm-level survey data from Nepal. We utilize a matching technique and stochastic production frontier model to examine the productivity and efficiency of farmers. Results reveal that the group of farmers adopting adaptations exhibit higher levels of productivity and technical efficiency in food production as compared to the non-adopters. It is evident from the results that policy makers should encourage farming households in climate change adaptations, which have the potential to enhance farmers’ productivity and efficiency in agriculture, thereby contributing to two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of eradicating hunger and poverty (SDG's target indicators 2.3). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Food security; Nepal; Production frontier; Selection bias; Sustainable development goals","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Developing countries; Efficiency; Planning; Productivity; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Food production; Matching techniques; Poorest countries; Smallholder farmers; Stochastic Production Frontiers; Technical efficiency; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095943549

Plaza Ferrandiz y Carbonell 2, Alcoy, Alicante  03801, Spain","European Union (EU) innovation policies have for long remained mostly research driven. The fundamental goal has been to achieve a rate of R&D investment of 3% of GDP. Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) innovation, however, relies on a variety of internal sources —both R&D and non-R&D based— and external drivers, such as collaboration with other firms and research centres, and is profoundly influence by location and context. Given this multiplicity of innovation activities, this study argues that innovation policies fundamentally based on a place-blind increase of R&D investment may not deliver the best outcomes in regions where the capacity of SMEs is to benefit from R&D is limited. We posit that collaboration and regional specificities can play a greater role in determining SME innovation, beyond just R&D activities. Using data from the Regional Innovation Scoreboard (RIS), covering 220 regions across 22 European countries, we find that regions in Europe differ significantly in terms of SME innovation depending on their location. SMEs in more innovative regions benefit to a far greater extent from a combination of internal R&D, external collaboration of all sorts, and non-R&D inputs. SMEs in less innovative regions rely fundamentally on external sources and, particularly, on collaboration with other firms. Greater investment in public R&D does not always lead to improvements in regional SME innovation, regardless of context. Collaboration is a central innovation activity that can complement R&D, showing an even stronger effect on SME innovation than R&D. Hence, a more collaboration-based and place-sensitive policy is required to maximise SME innovation across the variety of European regional contexts. © 2021 The Author(s)","Collaboration; EU regions; Place-based; R&D; Regional innovation; SMEs","Regional planning; European Countries; External sources; Innovation activity; Innovation policies; Regional innovation; Research centres; Research-driven; Small- and medium-sized enterprise; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116329828

The increase in demand for vehicles drives the growth of the automobile sector worldwide. Fabrication of vehicles consumes an enormous amount of water, energy and resources, thereby increasing carbon emissions. Nonbiodegradable and manufacturing waste after the end of life usage results in a significant contribution to incineration, landfills, air acidification and water eutrophication. The adoption of circular economy (CE) initiatives can play a significant role in dealing with increasing waste and environmental pollution. The main goal of CE is to recycle and reuse materials to reduce waste and also to minimise environmental impacts. This article strongly supports the adoption of CE in the Indian automobile industry. For the successful adoption of CE in the Indian automobile sector, first, it is important to analyse roadblocks to the adoption. Twenty potential roadblocks towards the adoption of CE have been identified from a literature review and in consultation with experts in the field. To capture the vagueness of the data and to carry out a robust analysis, a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method with Fuzzy theory is employed. The results reveal that roadblock ‘lacking ability to deliver high-quality remanufactured products’ is ranked first among all considered roadblocks. This study will help the Indian automobile industry, decision makers, research practitioners and government officials develop effective strategies for adopting CE in Indian automobile companies. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to validate the stability of results. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","automobile industry; business strategy; circular economy; environment; fuzzy TOPSIS; roadblocks","automobile industry; carbon emission; decision making; emission control; environmental economics; fuzzy mathematics; industrial performance; industrial practice; strategic approach; sustainable development; waste management; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094678515

Thus, it is important to explore how much of an impact the disease had and how long the damage lasted. Using quantitative time-series models, the present study explored the influence of MERS on inbound tourism in South Korea and estimates the concrete impact of MERS on the market in 2015. Monthly international tourist arrival data were provided by the Korea Tourism Organization from January 2009 to December 2015. The results showed that the contagious disease was statistically and negatively significant for inbound tourists visiting South Korea. During the time of MERS, from June 2015 to September 2015, the total effect was estimated to be −1,968,765 tourists with a loss of 3.1 billion USD in receipts.

The information and technology (IT) age has led to radical economic changes in both the relationships between individuals, companies, and governments and in the environment they exist in. Currently, electronic finance (e-finance) and environmental quality are critical issues that have received significant research attention in the form of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. With this in mind, this study aims to investigate the impact of e-finance on CO2 emissions. The study crafts a model with numerous control variables, including renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, urbanisation, manufacturing, and an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for the 29 OECD countries from 2007 to 2016. Fixed and random effects models of panel data are employed to control for the possible heterogeneity between countries. In addition, the study uses an instrumental variable estimation approach and a Canay(2011) panel quantile regression as a robustness check. The main results reveal that e-finance reduces CO2 emissions in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and leads to a lower pollution rate. The paper also finds that the EKC hypothesis holds. These findings have several important policy implications for OECD countries, and the model may be extended to investigate similar issues in developing economies. © 2020","Electronic finance; Environmental Kuznets curve; Fourth Industrial Revolution; GDP; Instrumental variables (ivs); Panel data","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Energy utilization; Industry 4.0; Pollution; Public policy; Random processes; Climate change adaptation; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental quality; Industrial revolutions; Information and technologies; Instrumental variables; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Renewable and non-renewable energy consumption; Finance; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental quality; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; OECD; panel data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097463268

These trends are related to the complex, multiple factors to be considered when evaluating 'smart' cities, that is, municipalities that seek to improve residents' quality of life by combining new technologies and environmentally sustainable practices. The above tendencies thus add to the myriad of indicators that need to be included in smart city assessments, whose intricacy hinders related decision-making processes. Based on the principles of multiple-criteria decision analysis, this paper seeks to integrate cognitive mapping and the Choquet integral to develop an assessment system that facilitates the evaluation of smart cities, which was named 'SMART-C.' The research includes a panel of experts on smart cities who identifies the evaluation criteria and their respective interactions. The results of a real-life application of the assessment system developed in this paper are validated both by the panel members and a representative of the Lisboa E-Nova nonprofit association of the Lisbon City Council's Environment and Energy Department. These experts confirm that the proposed evaluation system facilitates making distinctions between cities according to how fully they develop 'smartness.'

Total carbon production from mining now likely exceeds that generated by individual developed nations. This is now a prevailing and accepted feature in cryptocurrency markets, however unsustainable it may be. This paper investigates as to how Bitcoin's price volatility and the underlying dynamics of cryptocurrency mining characteristics affect underlying energy markets and utilities companies. Further analysis of potential side-effects within the market for Exchange Traded Funds are considered. The results show a sustained and significant influence of cryptocurrency energy-usage on the performance of some companies in the energy sector as separated by jurisdiction, emphasising the importance of further assessment of environmental impacts of cryptocurrency growth.

Due to the problems arising from urbanisation, local governments construct smart cities as inherent innovative advantages that can improve their level of science and technology, and efficiency in resource allocation, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Through this innovation-driven channel, shocks to the degree of city smartness can have a significant impact on the regional environment. In order to compute the sensitivity of urban pollution to the degree of city smartness in China both conceptually and empirically, we modify a theoretical model of classic land allocation decisions to demonstrate how local officials’ responsibilities to protect the ecological environment and promote economic growth can lead to the long-run spatial expansion of smart cities, resulting in the improvement of EEQ. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, we find that from 2005 to 2017 period, smart city initiatives in China reduced industrial exhaust gas and industrial wastewater by approximately 20.7% and 12.2%, respectively, such that most of the reduction may be attributed to the technology effect and allocation effect of urban innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Difference-in-differences model; Ecological environment quality; Innovation-driven channel; Smart city","Economics; Environmental technology; Pollution; Urban growth; City construction; Difference-in-differences models; Ecological environment quality; Ecological environments; Environmental pollutions; Innovation-driven channel; Local government; Resources allocation; Science and Technology; Smart city; economic growth; environmental quality; innovation; local government; smart city; urban pollution; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111064134

Although fashion companies have started to take some actions aimed at protecting the environment, how consumers make purchasing decisions about sustainable fashion products is a lingering question. This research thus investigates the effect of sustainable product attributes (i.e., recycled materials) on consumers’ purchase intention toward luxury and fast fashion products. Drawing from the social judgment theory, we propose that sustainability leads to higher consumers’ purchase intentions and that this effect is explained by the activation of perceived warmth. Three studies provide support for this assertation. Specifically, sustainable product attributes (i.e., recycled materials) affect positively the purchase intentions and this effect is magnified in the case of fast fashion products (Study 1). Consumers show more positive implicit attitudes when sustainability is paired with luxury than with fast fashion (Study 2). Finally, sustainability activates higher levels of perceived warmth which, in turn, affects consumers’ purchase intentions towards fast fashion products (Study 3). This research provides insightful theoretical implications by enclosing the psychological mechanism (i.e., perceived warmth) behind the relationship between sustainability and consumers’ purchase intentions. The paper also offers actionable levers on how to communicate sustainable initiatives to strengthen the consumer-brand relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fast fashion; Implicit association test (IAT); Luxury; Perceived warmth; Sustainability","Consumer protection; Purchasing; Recycling; Sales; Environmental damage; Fashion companies; Fashion industry; Implicit attitudes; Purchase intention; Purchasing decisions; Recycled materials; Sustainable products; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098120182

It is necessary to identify pathways toward sustainable urban development. This study explores the coordination relationship within the economy-resources-environment (ERE) system in the BTHUA during 2008–2017. First, a comprehensive indicator system and a coupling coordination index (CCI) were established to measure the coordination relationship in the ERE system. Second, an obstacle degree model was applied to identify the leading indicators affecting the coordinated development of the ERE system. Our results suggested that: (1) the coupling coordination state of the ERE system in the BTHUA has improved from a low coordination stage to a good coordination stage during the study period; (2) the spatial distribution of the coupling coordination state showed a pattern of better performance in the south and east and worse in the north and west; (3) the percentage of secondary industry in the GDP, percentage of built-up areas in the total land area, and sewage treatment rate were the primary factors that affected the ERE system's coordination state.

Moreover, a decision maker may not know the exact distribution of such endogenous demand and how it is affected by location choices. In this paper, we consider a distributionally robust facility location problem, in which we interpret the moments of stochastic demand as functions of facility-location decisions. We reformulate a two-stage decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization model as a monolithic formulation, and then derive exact mixed-integer linear programming reformulation as well as valid inequalities when the means and variances of demand are piecewise linear functions of location solutions. We conduct extensive computational studies, in which we compare our model with a decision-dependent deterministic model, as well as stochastic programming and distributionally robust models without the decision-dependent assumption. The results show superior performance of our approach with remarkable improvement in profit and quality of service under various settings, in addition to computational speed-ups given by formulation enhancements. These results draw attention to the need of considering the impact of location decisions on customer demand within this strategic-level planning problem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision-dependent uncertainty; Distributionally robust optimization; Facility location; Mixed-integer linear programming; Uncertainty modeling","Decision making; Integer programming; Piecewise linear techniques; Quality of service; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Computational studies; Deterministic modeling; Facility location decision; Facility location problem; Mixed integer linear programming; Monolithic formulation; Piece-wise linear functions; Robust optimization models; Location",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096845133

This research, joining in the ongoing investigation, aims to explore and empirically validate the key indicators of ethical challenges in digital healthcare. We conduct two studies using a combined exploratory and confirmatory approach. We apply the Delphi method for exploring and forecasting the key indicators in the first study. The key indicators are validated in the second study employing confirmatory factor analysis of survey data. The Delphi experts are 26 medical professionals and academic professors in Iran. A sample of 210 survey observations was collected from general hospital staff in Iran. Our results suggest that there are six key indicators of ethical challenges in digital healthcare: procedure values, responsibility, privacy, autonomy, security, justice. This research contributes to the knowledge of ethical concerns in applying digital technologies in healthcare, particularly identifying and validating the key indicators of the ethical challenges.

However, current research on code copyright protection mostly focuses on the approach for code plagiarism detection, failing to fundamentally solve the problem of copyright confirmation and protection. This paper proposes a blockchain-based code copyright management system. Firstly, an Abstract Syntax Tree-based code originality verification model is constructed. The originality of the uploaded code is determined through its similarity to other original codes. Secondly, the Peer-to-Peer blockchain network is designed to store the copyright information of the original code. The nodes in the blockchain network can verify the originality of the code based on the code originality verification model. Then, through the construction of blocks and legitimacy validation and linking of blocks, the blockchain-based code copyright management structure is built. The whole process guarantees that the copyright information is traceable and will not be tampered with. According to the experiments, the accuracy and processing time of the code originality verification model are shown to meet code originality verification requirements. The experiment also shows that the best storage type of the code copyright information is the code fingerprint which is a 256bits hash value converted from code eigenvalues. It performs better in both response speed and storage efficiency. Moreover, because of the uniqueness and irreversibility of the result from the SHA256 algorithm, the code fingerprint storage yields a better level of storage security. In summary, this paper proposes a blockchain-based code copyright management system which provides better response speed and storage efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Copyright management application; Node cooperation","Blockchain; Efficiency; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Intellectual property; Network security; Open source software; Peer to peer networks; Trees (mathematics); Abstract Syntax Trees; Copyright informations; Copyright protections; Management structure; Management systems; Open source software projects; Plagiarism detection; Verification model; Open systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100196529

This study uses bank-level data over the period 2011–2018 and it applies the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The present paper contributes to the understanding of green credit policy in China by examining the determinants of GCR, and its relationship with bank's profitability and credit risk. Our findings document that large and profitable banks tend to lend more green credits. Interestingly, there is no significant impact of bank risk on GCR. In other words, risk management is not a significant barrier for banks issuing green credits. We show that state-owned banks are more likely to lend green credits, which is supported by our finding that China's decisive attitude towards green credit policy is so strong that the bank's risk does not matter for the green credit lending policy. Moreover, green lending practices have a significant impact on the profitability and risk faced by these banks. One of the most striking findings of this paper is that while green lending increases the profitability of non-state-owned banks and reduces their risk, state-owned banks provide green credits at the expense of their profitability. This can be attributed to the Chinese government's ambition to push state-owned banks to play a key role in green lending. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bank's performance; Chinese banks; Green credit","Finance; Method of moments; Risk assessment; Risk management; Chinese Government; Credit risks; Generalized method of moments; Green credit policies; Green credits; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096399805

Specifically, we argue that structural gravity estimations should be performed with data that include not only international trade flows but also intra-national trade flows. The use of intra-national sales allows identification of the effects of non-discriminatory trade policies such as most favoured nation tariffs, even in the presence of exporter and importer fixed effects. A byproduct of our approach is that it can be used to recover estimates of the trade elasticity, a key parameter for quantitative trade models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in the case of most favoured nation tariffs and “time to export” as representative non-discriminatory determinants of trade on the importer and on the exporter side, respectively.

However, the practical implementation of BIM still faces barriers. Existing studies have discussed these barriers extensively, but the research on the barriers to the implementation of BIM amid building industrialization in China is inadequate. In this study, 23 barriers were identified through literature review. A questionnaire survey approach was used to collect data from various parties. Factor analysis methods were used to process and rank barrier factors for BIM applications in the context of industrialized building. Based on the analysis of each factor, analytic hierarchy process was adopted to identify the key barriers to the implementation of BIM for industrialized building construction. The study concluded that the main barriers for BIM implementation for industrialized building were capital-related factors and the lack of support from owners. This study proposes that in addition to governmental policy support for BIM and multi-stakeholder engagement, companies should also organize experts to effectively evaluate the risks of applying BIM. Overall, this study provides suggestions on construction organizational transformations in the roadmap of moving towards digital-driven building industrialization. © 2020 The Author(s).","Analytic hierarchy process; Barrier; Building information modeling; China; Factor analysis; Industrialized building; Prefabricated construction; Questionnaire survey","Construction; Data integration; Factor analysis; Surveys; Building industrializations; Building Information Model - BIM; Factor analysis method; Governmental policies; Industrialized buildings; Literature reviews; Organizational transformation; Questionnaire surveys; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099724510

We compare companies whose long-term debt matured shortly before versus after the credit crunch to obtain (quasi-)random variation in the extent to which companies were hit by the higher borrowing costs. We find that companies that were adversely affected followed a “two-pronged” approach of curtailing their workforce and capital expenditures, while maintaining their investments in R&D and CSR. We further document that firms that followed this two-pronged approach performed better post-crisis. Managerial summary: We study how companies adjusted their key strategic investments during the financial crisis of 2007–2009. As financial markets collapsed—and the cost of financing skyrocketed—managers had to rethink their strategic investments. We find that, on average, managers pursued a two-pronged approach of (i) “saving their way out of the crisis” by curtailing the company's workforce and capital expenditures and (ii) “investing their way out of the crisis” by maintaining the company's investments in R&D and CSR. Moreover, we find that firms that followed this two-pronged approach performed better in the post-crisis years.

These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management across energy vectors), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways.

We also find evidence that work centrality increases the strength of these positive relationships. Our results thus provide new insights on how spiritual leadership motivates hotels’ frontline employees to depart from customary ways of performing their jobs, towards seeking new opportunities to create value for the organization.

However, the existing literature is incapable of providing sufficient guidance in regard to the allocation of end-of-life tyre among recycling outlets to maximise the circular economy and sustainability outcomes. Hence, this study aims to propose a comprehensive list of evaluation criteria to rank recycling outlets, and develop an end-of-life tyre outlets selection matrix. A hybrid method is proposed by integrating fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process, fuzzy Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution, the multi-objective linear programming, and semi-structured interviews. By analysing the empirical data collected from one of the largest European collectors, this study reveals that cement manufacturing, which is the primary recycling outlet, ranks the lowest among the five recycling outlets in terms of the circular economy and sustainability outcome. Nevertheless, synthetic turf manufacturing and moulded objects manufacturing rank the highest in the circular economy and sustainability outcomes, respectively. It is proved that cost and profit are key drivers for recycling outlets selection, subjected to end consumers’ perceptions and the ease of end-of-life tyre processing. The ranking and the performance of recycling outlets also signify the competitive relationship between the circular economy and sustainability as excelling in the circular economy outcome would trade-off sustainability performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS; Multi criteria decision making; Multi objective programming; Sustainability","Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Economic and social effects; Linear programming; Recycling; Tires; Cement manufacturing; Circular economy; Evaluation criteria; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Fuzzy techniques; Multi-objective linear programming; Semi structured interviews; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099523307

As a result, we examine the impact of financial technologies (FinTechs) on SME efficiency. Using the Generalized Method of Moments methodology and 1,617 SME firms from 22 OECD countries during the period 2011–2018, we find that FinTechs are positively associated with SME efficiency. Interesting results emerge when we incorporate culture. Masculine societies positively moderate the link between FinTechs and SME efficiency. We also find that individualistic and long-term oriented cultures negatively affect the association between FinTechs and SME efficiency. Our findings have multiple implications. This study suggests the need for countries to introduce policies supporting FinTech startups in order to improve SME efficiency. Moreover, if the SME managers aim to achieve higher firm efficiency, then adopting FinTechs may act as a mechanism to attain this objective. Further, it may be important to consider both FinTechs and culture when evaluating cross-border investments. © 2020","Culture; FinTech; Firm efficiency; SMEs","Economics; Fintech; Method of moments; Cross-border; Firm efficiencies; Generalized method of moments; National cultures; OECD countries; Small and medium enterprise; Efficiency; capital flow; efficiency measurement; financial market; financial system; OECD; small and medium-sized enterprise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096543256

Mining online reviews has received extensive attention and efforts. Most existing research on mining online reviews focus on issues such as the impact of reviews on sales, helpfulness of reviews, and customers’ participation in reviews. Few research studies, however, seek to identify and extract innovation ideas for products from online reviews. This type of information is particularly important for product functionality improvement and new feature development from a manufacturer's perspective. Mining product innovation ideas allows a manufacturer to proactively review customer opinion and unlock insights about new functionality and features that the market expects, in order to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify sentences that contain innovation ideas from online reviews. Specifically, we develop a novel ensemble embedding method to generate semantic and contextual representations of the words in review sentences. The resultant representations in each sentence are then used in a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for innovation-sentence identification. Moreover, we adopt a focal loss function in our model to address the class imbalance problem. We validate our approach with a dataset of 10,000 customer reviews from Amazon. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.91 and an F1 score of 0.89, outperforming a set of state-of-the-art baseline models in the comparison. Our approach can be extended and applied to many other information extraction tasks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Information extraction; Online review mining; Product innovation; Text classification; Word embedding","Competition; Deep learning; Embeddings; Manufacture; Sales; Semantics; Class imbalance problems; Competitive advantage; Embedding method; Innovation ideas; Learning-based approach; Online customer reviews; Product innovation; Research studies; Long short-term memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091992035

However, there are many controversies about whether digital technology can reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. Based on OECD data, KPWW method and multiple panel regression, this paper explores the impact and mechanism of digital technology innovation and technology spillover to the domestic carbon emission intensity. Through impulse response analysis and variance decomposition, the comprehensive impact of digital technology on carbon intensity is clarified. This paper concludes that technology innovation in the information industry will increase the intensity of carbon emissions, while cross-industry technology spillovers are persistent for reducing the intensity of domestic carbon emissions. Since the emission reduction effect of technology spillover is greater than the emission increase effect of technology innovation, the digital technology would empower domestic green development. Increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy use and optimizing the industrial structure are effective mechanisms for digital technology innovation to reduce carbon emission intensity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission intensity; Digital technology; Technology spillover","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Impulse response; Carbon emission intensities; Digital technologies; Effective mechanisms; Impulse response analysis; Industrial structures; Technology innovation; Technology spillovers; Variance decomposition; Engineering research; carbon emission; emission control; empowerment; energy use; global economy; innovation; spillover effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108351095

Academic/ practical relevance: Because of the rapid growth of retail platforms in recent years, information sharing has become an increasingly important issue because retail platforms can gather an enormous amount of consumer information that may not be visible to the sellers. Understanding how to share such information with those sellers will provide useful implications from both the theoretical and practical perspectives. Methodology: We develop a game-Theoretic model where multiple sellers engage in Cournot competition on a retail platform by selling substitutable products, and the platform charges a commission fee for each transaction. The platform owns superior demand information and can control the accuracy level when sharing the information with the sellers. Results: We find that the platform has incentives to share the information, and such sharing is beneficial both to the platform and to all sellers. Under the asymmetric information-sharing format, the optimal strategy for the platform is to select a subgroup of sellers and truthfully share information with them. Under the symmetric sharing format, the platform must use the same accuracy level and the same set of information for all sellers, and thus has incentives to reduce the accuracy of the shared information.Moreover, we identify a simple pricing mechanism that can achieve the optimal information-sharing outcome. Managerial implications: This research highlights the importance of considering the impact of information sharing for a retail platform with competing sellers. It also proposes a simple, single-price mechanism to implement the optimal sharing strategy. These results could provide useful guidelines for platform managers to better design their informationsharing services. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This is an important question because only when the Chinese cadre evaluation system rewards local officials’ green behaviors, these officials would move away from their past priority in promoting economic growth at all costs, so that the environmental crisis in China might be addressed. We collect party secretary data for Chinese counties between 2001 and 2014 to measure promotion patterns. We construct county-year SO2 and PM2.5 pollution measures using NASA satellite data. We adopt an instrumental variable approach to deal with potential endogeneity issues of the pollution variables: for both PM 2.5 and SO2, we use ventilation coefficient, i.e., the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, as the instrument. Our empirical analysis shows that for county party secretaries, those who are able to reduce air pollution are more likely to be promoted. We find similar results for county magistrates.

On the one hand, a passenger who pools benefits from paying a lower fare and the RSP benefits from increasing occupancy per car, thereby serving more passengers. On the other hand, a passenger who pools takes more time, on average, to reach her destination and may have to share the ride with a stranger, and the RSP gets a lower profit margin per passenger than from solo rides. We develop a queueing model to find the RSP's optimal revenue in equilibrium when passengers are strategic and drivers are independent agents, and design the RSP's revenue-maximizing price-service menu. We find that offering both solo and pooled rides is optimal when the distribution of passenger-type is not skewed and congestion is not high. Counter intuitively, when congestion is high, the RSP benefits from offering only one ride choice. Simulation-based results extend these findings when more than one route exists. We provide a numerical example based on real-life data.

This study aims to explore the effects of Big Five personality traits on the energy-saving behavior of residents based on the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). We employ the k-means algorithm to cluster 1119 respondents in Xi'an, China by their personality characteristics into four groups: (1) the positives, (2) the temperates, (3) the conservatives, and (4) the introverts. The research observes significant heterogeneity of energy-saving behavior among the four resident groups. We examine the behavioral pattern of each resident group, and the analysis indicates that TPB attributes bridge personality traits and household energy-saving behaviors. The extended TPB factors explain the best performance on household energy-saving intention and behaviors of the positives. Besides, the results present the different effects of psychological factors on the energy-saving behaviors of different resident groups. The positive and temperate groups’ energy-saving intention is more sensitive to subjective norms, while perceived behavior control plays a more critical role in other groups. This study could broaden the scope of pro-environmental behavior research and advance knowledge by untangling the intertwined relationship between personality traits and household energy-saving behavior. The findings can contribute to occupant typology development, which is important to capture the diverse energy effect of occupant activity in building energy simulation research as well as differential energy-saving intervention setting in residential buildings to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2021","Building energy modeling; Energy-saving behavior; Five factor model; Personality traits; Pro-environmental behavior; Theory of planned behavior","Behavioral research; K-means clustering; Sustainable development; Building energy model; Energy savings; Energy saver; Energy-saving behavior; Energy-savings; Five-Factor Model; Household energy; Personality traits; Pro-environmental behaviors; Theory of Planned Behavior; Energy conservation; computer simulation; conservation management; energy conservation; heterogeneity; household energy; numerical model; residential energy; Sustainable Development Goal; theoretical study; adult; article; behavior control; China; energy conservation; female; household; human; human experiment; k means clustering; major clinical study; male; personality; psychological aspect; resident; simulation; sustainable development; Theory of Planned Behavior; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113218051

This decline is believed to have resulted in a decrease in carbon emissions. A neoclassical framework was built to estimate the labor force mitigation effect on CO2 emissions theoretically. The specific features of the nexus of CO2 emissions, economic development, and rural-urban transfer were investigated and evaluated within this framework. Two important propositions were derived from the theoretical model. First, the higher the ratio of the labor force working in the non-agricultural sector, the higher the emissions. Second, the speed of labor force transfer from the agricultural to non-agricultural sectors impacts peak emission levels. In the empirical study, data from China's 29 provinces for 1995-2012 were utilized to examine the two propositions. The GMM method was employed to control the possible endogeneity problem and introduce dynamics to the model. The empirical results verified the theoretical propositions. In addition, we concluded that the impact of labor transfer on CO2 emissions is subject to socioeconomic development levels in the long run. © 2021","Agricultural industry; China; CO2 emissions; Labor force transfer; Non-agricultural industry","Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Industrial economics; Agricultural industries; Agricultural sector; Carbon emissions; China; CO$-2$/ emission; Economic transitions; Labor force; Labor force transfers; Migrant workers; Non-agricultural industry; Carbon dioxide; agricultural labor; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; pollution tax; technological change; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109082578

SCM is an important driver for organization's competitive advantage. The fierce competition in the market has forced companies to look the past conventional decision-making process, which is based on intuition and previous experience. The swift evolution of information technologies (ITs) and digitization tools has changed the scenario for many industries, including those involved in SCM. Design/methodology/approach: The Best Worst Method (BWM) has been applied to evaluate, rank and prioritize the key digitization and IT enablers beneficial for the improvement of SC performance. The study also used additive value function to rank the organizations on their SC performance with respect to digitization enablers. Findings: The total of 25 key enablers have been identified and ranked. The results revealed that “big data/data science skills”, “tracking and localization of products” and “appropriate and feasibility study for aiding the selection and adoption of big data technologies and techniques ” are the top three digitization and IT enablers that organizations need to focus much in order to improve their SC performance. The study also ranked the SC performance of the organizations based on digitization enablers. Practical implications: The findings of this study will help the organizations to focus on certain digitization technologies in order to improve their SC performance. This study also provides an original framework for organizations to rank the key digitization enablers according to enablers relevant in their context and also to compare their performance with their counterparts. Originality/value: This study seems to be the first of its kind in which 25 digitization enablers categorized in four main categories are ranked using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool. This study is also first of its kind in ranking the organizations in their SC performance based on weights/ranks of digitization enablers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Best Worst Method; Big data analysis; Blockchain technology; Digitization tools; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Supply chain management","Big data; Competition; Supply chain management; Additive value functions; Competitive advantage; Decision making process; Design/methodology/approach; Feasibility studies; Multi-criteria decision making; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain performance; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095840665

As organizations acquire experience, their performance typically improves at a decreasing rate. Although this learning-curve pattern is found in many industries, organizations vary in the rate at which they learn. In order to understand this variation, we separate organizational learning into four processes: search, knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer. Within each process, we present research on how dimensions of experience and of the organizational context affect learning processes and outcomes. Our goals are to describe major findings and to identify opportunities for future research.

Municipalities seek to improve their citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but the need to find a balance between these complex factors makes decision-making processes more difficult. Experts must analyze the determinants of smart cities, which are urban centers intended to be socially involved, habitable, and economically and environmentally sustainable, and that rely strongly on technology and innovation. Based on multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) principles, this study combines cognitive mapping techniques and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to develop a multicriteria model that can help managers analyze smart city determinants in a collaborative manner. The research included identifying these determinants and their respective cause-and-effect relationships using an expert panel's experience and knowledge related to the subject under analysis. The results were validated by both the panel and the city councilor responsible for mobility and municipal projects within Évora City Council, Portugal, which has implemented smart city strategies. The latter specialist verified that the proposed evaluation system can be used as a tool to facilitate smart city collaborative decision-making processes.

To unpack the COVID impacts on finfish aquaculture, two online based surveys were performed in Mymensingh, Bangladesh using structured questionnaires with 40 farmers to assess the economic feasibility of aquaculture farming, and 120 middlemen of the supply chain to unpack market instability. This was followed up with a further open-ended survey done with 120 consumers to gain a clear view of the marketing insights. Our study has revealed that COVID has resulted in a squeeze on profit for the finfish farmer and has opened up inequalities within the supply chain. Benefit-cost ratio analysis of farming reveals that although carp and other catfish farming remain close to the break-even level, pangasius and tilapia farming was potentially putting the farmers in debt. Whilst the consumers are now paying higher prices for pangasius and carp, and slightly reduced prices for tilapia and other catfish, the finfish farmers were receiving less profits. By contrast, the middlemen have increased their selling prices, presumably to offset increased costs and maintain profitability. To compensate rising operational costs and reduced income, farmers have reduced labor costs through reduction in number of staff and their wages. However, this compensation tool risks frustrating working-class people in rural areas and posing huge socio-economic burdens. Finally, the economic difficulties and a lack of support to process fish imposed by COVID restrictions have switched consumer's attitudes regarding fish as their protein source preference. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aquaculture; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Food security; Supply chain disruption","aquaculture industry; cost-benefit analysis; COVID-19; economic analysis; economic impact; finfish; fishery economics; food security; industrial performance; profitability; rural area; socioeconomic impact; Bangladesh; Mymensingh [Bangladesh]; catfish; Pangasius; Pangasius pangasius; Tilapia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105249266

However, given the complexities in many economies of the world today, it is important to reassess the ecological concerns of these factors in light of the Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Therefore, this current study investigates the global assessment using data from World Bank Development database from 1995 to 2016. Evidence from the method employed, sys-GMM, revealed that the economic complexities index increases the carbon emission in low-income groups while it significantly decreases the carbon emission for upper-middle and high-income groups. For the combined group, the EKC hypothesis holds, and ECI significantly hampers carbon emissions. For the other variables, it is worthy of note that (1) economic growth contributes to the high carbon contents across the income group especially for low-income, upper-middle-income and high-income group; (2) the effects of air transport on carbon emission is positive for lower-middle-income and high-income group and negative for the upper-middle-income group; (3) the use of coal rents and energy use leads to high release of carbon contents across all the income groups; and (4) a significant increase in the utilization of energy leads to increase in carbon contents except for lower-income group, it leads to a decrease. From this empirical assessment, vital energy policy directions are suggested. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","air transportation; coal rents; economic complexity index; economic growth; emissions; energy use; environmental degradation; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; income clusters","air transportation; carbon emission; economic growth; energy use; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental policy; income; Kuznets curve; sustainability; sustainable development; World Bank",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102510113

However, a few previous studies have examined these two concepts together at the choice level of CEB. This paper discusses the internal selection logic of CEB by using multinomial logit (MNL) models that consider the choices of enterprises in green innovation and illegal emissions, both across China and separately in different regions. The objective of this paper is to consider the four choices available to heavily polluting enterprises’ dual-target corporate environmental behavior (DTCEB), including alienated, conservative, contradictory, and intimate environmental behaviors. The results of this study show that, under various external pressures, 61.2% of heavily polluting enterprises choose conservative environmental behavior. There is also generally a lack of synchronization between the goals of short-term economic and long-term social benefits. At the current stage, environmental regulation measures should focus on guiding enterprises to change from alienated, conservative, and contradictory behaviors, to intimate. Instead of only focusing on monitoring pollution emissions, the government should focus on green innovation guidance to effectively promote the transformation and upgrading of heavily polluting enterprises. A moderate adjustment of the intensity of command regulation may lead to better regulatory effects. Specifically, the enforcement of laws across China should be slowed; efforts should be made to increase the focus of public participation in the eastern region; the importance of incentive-based tax rate preferences should be increased in the central region, and the intensity of legislation should be strengthened in the western region. Compared with the emphasis on environmental performance in other literature, this article uses comparative thinking to explore the choice logic of the DTCEBs, which attaches different degrees of importance to long-term social benefits and short-term economic benefits. © 2021","Dual-target corporate environmental behavior; Environmental regulation; Green innovation; Heavily polluting enterprises; Pollutant emissions","Computer circuits; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Pollution; Taxation; Corporates; Dual-target corporate environmental behavior; Environment regulations; Environmental behavior; Green innovations; Heavily polluting enterprise; Hot topics; Pollutants emissions; Short term; Social benefits; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102855400

The research findings suggest that the viability of smart urban ecosystems relies on the ability of focal actors to implement a techno-bureaucratic governance model which relies on an integrated policy framework that accounts for the tripartite social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by cities. Citizen-centredness and greenness are the core values that embed urban smartness. Such values are useless if not backed by community engagement. Further developments should be targeted to unravel the role of datification and computerization in underpinning the collective intelligence of smart cities for the purpose of urban sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Smart city; Smartness; Sustainability; Urban ecosystem; Viability","Economics; Ecosystems; Smart city; Urban growth; Advanced technology; Bibliometrics analysis; Economic growths; Governance models; Literature reviews; Practical solutions; Shedding light; Smartness; Urban ecosystem; Viability; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102551391

Promoting financial inclusion and developing good governance are main, but challenging priorities in the MENA region. The paper empirically investigates the relationship between financial inclusion, governance, and economic growth in the MENA region. A system General Method of Moments (GMM) dynamic panel model technique is employed on annual data for 44 emerging markets (EMs) and MENA over the period 1990–2018, using a number of measures of financial inclusion covering the households and the firms’ access to finance. Particularly, the study uses indicators such as the number of bank accounts (per 1000 adult population), bank accounts for corporates/enterprises, and the number of bank branches and ATMS (per 100,000 people), percentage of firms using banks to finance investments, and the percentage of firms using bank loans to finance working capital. The results of the study indicate that financial inclusion positively impacts GDP per capita growth in the selected countries. Financial inclusion measured by the households’ financial access index has a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth in the MENA region, but requires supervisory and regulatory regimes with backing of the rule of law, judicial independence, contract enforcement, control of corruption, and political stability. The results also indicate that the effect firms’ access to finance is only statistically significant in the presence of strong institutions. Finally, our results imply that countries with relatively low levels of financial access services, such as the MENA region, would benefit the most from an improvement in governance. Hence, our policy implications are directed towards developing a national strategic plan aimed towards improving access to finance coupled with policies aimed at improving the level of governance in order to maximize the impact of financial access on economic growth. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Economic growth; Financial development; Financial inclusion; Governance; MENA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104071741

Both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that a variety of factors, such as safety of vaccines, severity of diseases, information and advice from healthcare professionals, influence an individual's intention to vaccinate. However, limited research has been conducted on analysing systematically how individuals’ vaccine acceptance decisions are made from their beliefs and judgements on the influential factors. In particular, there is lack of quantitative analysis on how individuals’ beliefs and judgements may evolve from the spreading of vaccination-related information in a social network, which further affects their decision making. In this paper, an integrated model is first proposed to characterise the socially influenced vaccination decision-making process, in which each individual's beliefs and subjective judgements on the decision criteria are formulated as belief distributions in the framework of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The spreading of social influence in the network environment is further incorporated into the information aggregation process for supporting informed vaccination decision analysis. A series of simulation-based analyses on a real-world social network is conducted to demonstrate that the overall vaccination coverage is determined primarily by individuals’ beliefs and judgements on the decision criteria, and is also affected sensitively by the characteristics of influence spreading (including the content and amount of vaccination-related information) in the social network. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Evidential reasoning; Influence spreading; OR in health services; Social network; Vaccination decision making","Decision making; Decision theory; Diseases; Operations research; Vaccines; Decision criterions; Decision making process; Health care professionals; Information aggregation; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Network environments; Simulation-based analysis; Subjective judgement; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098054686

Further, beliefs of a manufacturer's expertise and trustworthiness were found to reduce consumer risk concerns and strengthen consumer conviction that the benefits of technology were attainable. Structural equation modeling of survey data confirm the proposed consumer decision model, and our contention that technology adoption can be better understood by specifically exploring discordant consumer beliefs of the post-purchase consequences.

However, the pandemic also revealed that the supply chains that provide crucial raw materials for manufacturing electronics are increasingly vulnerable to social, geopolitical, and technical disruptions. These vulnerabilities are likely to escalate in the future, due to global health crises, natural disasters, and global political instability, all of which will be magnified by looming climate change impacts. This study investigates potential supply chain disruption risks in the electronics sector by applying metrics that capture supply, demand, socio-political, and environmental risks in a multi-criteria framework to almost 40 metals and minerals that provide critical functionality to electronic products. Results illustrate that the material risks varied with the potential nature of the disruption. For example, in scenarios where disruptions led to price volatility or weakening of environmental regulations, highest risks were observed for precious metals such as gold, rhodium, platinum, and palladium. On the other hand, in scenarios where disruptions led to supply pressures or geopolitical tensions, cobalt, gallium, and key rare earth elements exhibited the highest risks. These metals are characterized by energy-intense manufacturing and highly concentrated geographic production, suggesting that recycling and supply chain diversification may alleviate some of the identified risks.

First, we draw on the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) theory to introduce OBC website quality (termed OBC-SiteQUAL), alongside brand involvement as a customer resource input, to shape an expanded quadripartite CE conceptualisation. Second, using multi-country data, we test the validity of the OBC-SiteQUAL and CE measurement models, and the theoretical framework. Results indicate that the newly conceived OBC-SiteQUAL construct, underpinned by various web-based cues related to affective elements, brand interaction and customer-to-customer interaction, positively influences CE, whereas brand involvement partially influences CE. Third, we examine how these variables translate to behavioural loyalty outcomes. Empirically, a consistent pattern across the country samples indicates that OBC-SiteQUAL can affect behavioural loyalty by enhancing CE. Thus, we reliably confirm the mediating effect of CE (O) between OBC-SiteQUAL (S) and behavioural loyalty (R). Fourth, we found that the impact of OBC-SiteQUAL and brand involvement on CE differs between younger and older Gen Y consumers.

This raises the importance of understanding public perceptions regarding safety considerations when traveling alongside AVs. This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective, socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual's perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally, we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular, there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development, but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users.

Such integration enables us to capture the driver's routing behavior in practice as the driver's decision-making process is often unobservable or intricate to model. Focusing on the order-assignment problemas an example, we discuss the classes of tractable predictors and prediction models that are highly compatible with the existing stochastic and robust optimization tools.We further provide reformulations of the integrated models, which can be efficiently solved with the proposed branch-and-price algorithm. Moreover, we propose two simple heuristics for the multiperiod order-assignment problem, and they are built upon single-period solutions.

Using the Chinese power generation industry from 2007 to 2017 as a sample, we employ the system generalized method of moments (system GMM) to study the impact of environmental regulation on the energy investment structure and explore how differences in regions and environmental regulations affect the energy investment structure. The results show that although environmental regulation increased the proportion of investment in new energy power generation, different types and levels of environmental regulations affected investment in power generation differently. Stricter command-and-control environmental regulation policies at the formulation level increased the investment proportion of new energy power generation. However, the regional data show that different types and levels of environmental regulation affected the power generation investment structure in each region differently. Both command-and-control and market-based environmental regulation in China's central and western regions failed to play their role.

First, products need to be grouped into categories based on retailers’ brand and suppliers’ brand. This help to prevent future problems with the items that bear the supermarket's brand. This categorization is also helpful in defining the right place, price, and promotion for products with SSL. Besides, the pricing of items with SSL should be dynamic.

Using unique data over a 12-month period from a major online retailer, this paper examines the impact of daily social media activity on daily business outcomes: website traffic, orders and sales. Key findings reveal that social media leads to increased web traffic, but it does not produce a significant rise in product orders and sale income. Though, larger social media campaigns tend to result in significantly higher number of orders and sale income, and Facebook emerges as the most effective channel.

The stochastic frontier analysis is used to calculate technical efficiency in apple production, accounting for the endogenous issues of intermediate inputs. The endogenous switching regression model is employed to examine the impact of Internet use on technical efficiency, accounting for the self-selectivity bias arising from observable and unobservable factors. The survey reveals that 52.4% of the sample farm households use the Internet to acquire technological information. On average, technical efficiency in apple production for the sample farm households merely equals 0.63, indicating substantial room for further improvement. After accounting for the self-selectivity bias, the Internet users would reduce technical efficiency by 30.3% if they had not used the Internet to acquire technological information. The robustness check using the treatment effects model reconfirms that Internet use can improve technical efficiency in apple production.

The analysis on empirical modeling shows a preference for partial equilibrium modeling, differences-in-differences evaluation methods, and cross-section econometrics, with all these choices largely dependent on the type of data available. The meta-analysis finds that most results on employment and wages are non-significant. When significant, decreases in employment and wages are more likely to occur than increases with decreases strongly associated with the short-term, middle-income countries, females, young and informal workers. Food and rent prices tend to increase in the short-term but other prices may decrease. The probability of observing a decrease in household well-being among hosts is lower than 1 in 5. © 2021","Employment; Escapees; Expellees; Forced displacement; Forced migration; Host communities; Internally displaced persons (IDPs); Labor markets; Prices; Refugees; Returnees; Unemployment; Wages; Well-being","economic history; economics; empirical analysis; employment; forced migration; historical perspective; labor market; refugee; unemployment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100393983

Future EV adoption depends on overcoming multiple barriers, including charging infrastructure, sufficient electricity generation, and the availability of battery raw materials at acceptable costs, including cobalt, copper and nickel – which typically are co-produced. Various EV projections have been made, along with associated requirements for battery raw materials (demand). There have been separate assessments of the availability of raw materials (supply). However, integrated assessments of supply and demand and their interaction over time are lacking to support decision-making. Using a dynamic market model that reflects the co-produced nature of cobalt, copper and nickel production as well as recycling, we estimate global output of these three metals under different EV growth scenarios from 2020 to 2040. Results suggest that starting in 2025, replacement demand for battery raw materials becomes important. Thus, estimates for future material demand that consider only demands from new EVs are incomplete and misleading. EV deployment and associated increased demand for raw materials will have a greater impact on prices for cobalt than nickel and, in turn, for nickel than copper. High EV deployment scenarios will be difficult to achieve without larger supplies of copper, nickel and cobalt than forthcoming under the conditions modeled here, which anticipates a six-year time lag between a demand increase and the expansion of metal-production capacity. Shortening battery lifetimes and improving collection and recycling rates increase secondary supply, but the extent to which these factors support additional EV deployment is mixed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Cobalt; Copper; Costs; Decision making; Electronic Waste; Recycling; Secondary batteries; Supply chains; Charging infrastructures; Deployment scenarios; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity generation; Global electrification; Integrated assessment; Material supply chains; Nickel and cobalts; Automobile materials; cobalt; copper; nickel; cobalt; copper; decision making; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; electronic equipment; nickel; recycling; supply chain management; technology adoption; chemical industry; controlled study; economic decision making; electric vehicle; marketing; material supply chain; materials management; motor vehicle; price; raw materials availability; recycling; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096616952

The two failure modes are competing in the sense that either one, on a “whichever-comes-first” basis, can cause the product to fail. A performance-based warranty not only covers the repair or replacement of any defect, but also guarantees the minimum performance level throughout the warranty period. In this article, we propose three compensation policies—that is, free replacement, penalty, and full refund, when a product's performance fails to meet the guaranteed level. The expected warranty servicing costs for the three policies are derived, based on the competing risks concept. A warranty design problem is further formulated to simultaneously determine the optimal product price, warranty length, and performance guarantee level so as to maximize the manufacturer's total profit. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate and compare the three performance-based compensation policies. It is shown that the full refund policy always leads to the lowest total profit, whereas neither of the other two policies can dominate each other in all scenarios. In particular, the free replacement policy results in a higher total profit than the penalty policy when the replacement cost is low, the penalty cost coefficient is high, and/or the product reliability is high. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Competing risks; Performance deterioration; Warranty; Warranty policy design","Profitability; Hard and soft failures; Performance based; Performance guarantees; Performance level; Product reliability; Replacement costs; Replacement policy; Warranty servicing costs; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095854889

It does so by exploring three different cases of certification design in the food retailing industry: unilateral Tesco Nurture, collaborative GlobalGAP, and multi-stakeholder UTZ certifications. Using case study methods and viewing the certifications through the application of collective action logic and dynamic capability theory, we provide new insights important to researchers, retailers, and supply chains. The results of this study show that retail efforts to develop certifications are driven by better alignment with the business’ goal of improving the sustainability performance of supply chains. Retail-driven certifications can enable stronger brand assurance, stakeholder satisfaction, competitive development of certified supply volumes, and dynamic capabilities that contribute to effective, efficient and faster upgrades to sustainability practices in the supply chain. The contributions of this study also identify numerous factors that influence the development of certifications via collaborative/multi-stakeholder or unilateral efforts. There are three major factors: 1) trade-offs between different aspects of certification design and institutional-stakeholder context, 2) challenges of ‘collective’ bargaining, and 3) generation of dynamic capabilities. From results, we posit the co-existence of multiple certifications, called “standards multiplicity,” as advantageous for facilitating retailers’ engagement with sustainable supply chain management. Finally, conclusions and implications allow us to predict the evolving complexity of retail-driven certifications will enable dynamic capabilities, opportunities for creating competitive advantage, and open a dialogue for other industries to learn from these insights. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Certification; Food retailing; Multiplicity; Standards; Supply chains; Sustainability","Competition; Economic and social effects; Enterprise resource management; Sales; Sustainable development; Case study methods; Competitive advantage; Competitive development; Dynamic capabilities; Stakeholder satisfactions; Sustainability performance; Sustainability practices; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092737945

A remanufacturing process usually contains three shops, i.e., disassembly, processing and assembly shops. EOL products are dissembled into multiple components in a disassembly shop. Reusable components are reprocessed in a processing shop, and reassembled into their corresponding products in an assembly shop. To realize an overall optimization, we have to integrate them together when making decisions. In practice, a decision-maker usually has to optimize multiple criteria such as cost-related and service-oriented objectives. Additionally, we cannot accurately acquire the detail of EOL products due to their various usage processes. Therefore, multi-objective and uncertainty need to be considered simultaneously in an integrated disassembly-reprocessing-reassembly scheduling process. This work investigates a stochastic multi-objective integrated disassembly-reprocessing-reassembly scheduling problem to achieve the expected makespan and total tardiness minimization. To handle this problem, this work develops a multi-objective discrete fruit fly optimization algorithm incorporating a stochastic simulation approach. Its search techniques are designed according to this problem's features from five aspects, i.e., solution representation, heuristic decoding rules, smell-searching, vision-searching, and genetic-searching. Simulation experiments are conducted by adopting twenty-five instances to verify the performance of the proposed approach. Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, bi-objective multi-start simulated annealing method, and hybrid multi-objective discrete artificial bee colony are chosen for comparisons. By analyzing the results with three performance metrics, we can find that the proposed approach performs better on all the twenty-five instances than its peers. Specifically, it outperforms them by 6.45%–9.82%, 6.91%–17.64% and 1.19%–2.76% in terms of performance, respectively. The results confirm that the proposed approach can effectively and efficiently tackle the investigated problem. © 2020","Fruit fly optimization; Integrated disassembly-reprocessing-reassembly scheduling; Remanufacturing; Stochastic multi-objective optimization; Stochastic simulation","Decision making; Fruits; Genetic algorithms; Scheduling; Simulated annealing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Artificial bee colonies; Economic and environmental benefits; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Performance metrics; Remanufacturing process; Simulated annealing method; Solution representation; Stochastic simulations; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089676010

Numerous studies on this problem have appeared in the literature in the last two decades; however, almost all of them are based on either efficiency invariance or efficiency maximization, both of which focus mainly on efficiency scores. It is notable that the efficiency score is more an intermediate indicator and the corresponding efficiency ranking is actually the main focus. Motivated by this observation, this paper aims to propose a new approach for allocating the fixed cost across decision making units (DMUs) based on efficiency ranking. To this end, the efficiency ranking intervals are explicitly determined by taking allocated costs and feasible weights into account. The results indicate that each DMU can be ranked at any position ranging from the best one to the worst n, and there are fixed cost allocation schemes that can determine the best efficiency ranking of one for each individual DMU simultaneously under a set of common weights. Furthermore, we define a new comprehensive satisfaction degree based on the interval of the upper and lower bounds of the allocated costs. Then, we generate the final allocation scheme using an iterative procedure to maximize the satisfaction degree across all DMUs. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a classic numerical example from prior literature and an empirical study from the real world to illustrate its usefulness and efficacy. © Operational Research Society 2020.","comprehensive satisfaction degree; Data envelopment analysis; efficiency ranking; fixed cost allocation","Cost accounting; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Decision making unit; Efficiency maximization; Efficiency rankings; Empirical studies; Fixed cost allocation; New approaches; Satisfaction degrees; Upper and lower bounds; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079382779

Regenerative organizations seek to reverse this damage, emphasizing how to help local places flourish. Drawing on a six-year inductive study of one such regenerative organization, we derive an empirically grounded model which argues that regeneration depends on effectively managing place-based tensions paradoxically. Shorefast built social enterprises aimed at redeveloping the cultural and economic resilience of Fogo Island, Canada, a community devastated by the collapse of the North Atlantic cod fishery. They triggered place-based tensions and managed them paradoxically by creating conditions for meaningful exchange and by taking a patient approach. Together, these efforts facilitated both the discovery of place-based opportunities and the regeneration of place. Our model challenges organizational researchers studying place to move beyond considering place-based tensions as conflicts and, instead, to study their paradoxical nature and management.

This increased demand has raised questions about how such a new matching mechanism will affect the efficiency of the transportation system-in particular, whether it will help reduce passengers' average waiting time compared with traditional street-hailing systems. Academic/practical relevance: The on-demand ride-hailing problem has gained much academic interest recently. The results we find in the ride-hailing system have a significant deviation from classic queueing theory where en route time does not play a role. Methodology: In this paper, we shed light on this question by building a stylized model of a circular road and comparing the average waiting times of passengers under various matching mechanisms. Results: We discover the inefficiency in the on-demand ride-hailing system when the en route time is long, which may result in nonmonotonicity of passengers' average waiting time as the passenger arrival rate increases. After identifying key tradeoffs between different mechanisms, we find that the on-demand matching mechanism could result in lower efficiency than the traditional street-hailing mechanism when the system utilization level is medium and the road length is long. Managerial implications: To overcome the disadvantage of both systems, we further propose adding response caps to the on-demand ride-hailing mechanism and develop a heuristic method to calculate a near-optimal cap. We also examine the impact of passenger abandonments, idle time strategies of taxis, and traffic congestion on the performance of the ride-hailing systems. The results of this research would be instrumental for understanding the trade-offs of the new service paradigm and thus enable policy makers to make more informed decisions when enacting regulations for this emerging service paradigm.

Yet, measuring the quality of knowledge work is challenging, raising the question of how to evaluate AI performance in such contexts. We investigate this question through a field study of a major U.S. hospital, observing how managers evaluated five different machine-learning (ML) based AI tools. Each tool reported high performance according to standard AI accuracy measures, which were based on ground truth labels provided by qualified experts. Trying these tools out in practice, however, revealed that none of them met expectations. Searching for explanations, managers began confronting the high uncertainty of experts’ know-what knowledge captured in ground truth labels used to train and validate ML models. In practice, experts address this uncertainty by drawing on rich know-how practices, which were not incorporated into these ML-based tools. Discovering the disconnect between AI’s know-what and experts’ know-how enabled managers to better understand the risks and benefits of each tool. This study shows dangers of treating ground truth labels used in ML models objectively when the underlying knowledge is uncertain.

But theory does not prescribe estimable forms of this relationship. By estimating 800 plausible specifications of the temperature-GDP relationship, we demonstrate that a wide variety of models are statistically indistinguishable in their out-of-sample performance, including models that exclude any temperature effect. This full set of models, however, implies a wide range of climate change impacts by 2100, yielding considerable model uncertainty. The uncertainty is greatest for models that specify effects of temperature on GDP growth that accumulate over time; the 95% confidence interval that accounts for both sampling and model uncertainty across the best-performing models ranges from 84% GDP losses to 359% gains. Models of GDP levels effects yield a much narrower distribution of GDP impacts centered around 1–3% losses, consistent with damage functions of major integrated assessment models. Further, models that incorporate lagged temperature effects are indicative of impacts on GDP levels rather than GDP growth. We identify statistically significant marginal effects of temperature on poor country GDP and agricultural production, but not rich country GDP, non-agricultural production, or GDP growth. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Cross validation; Econometrics; GDP impacts; Model uncertainty","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Damage detection; Developing countries; Global warming; Temperature; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural productions; Climate change impact; Confidence interval; Damage assessments; Effects of temperature; Integrated assessment models; Model uncertainties; Temperature impact; Climate models; accuracy assessment; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105343662

Using stakeholder theory and the relational view, we distinguish between two main drivers: stakeholder pressures (i.e., from regulatory agencies, buying firms, and nongovernmental organizations) and relational mechanisms offered by multinational companies (MNCs) (i.e., lean trainings and relational capital). We used a multi-method research design to study how these drivers uniquely influence supplier responsibility in an emerging-country context. An in-depth case study with Philips Lighting and 10 of its Chinese suppliers reveals causal inferences that link stakeholder and relational drivers with each responsibility dimension (environmental vs. social). Audit and survey data from Philips Lighting's 134 Chinese suppliers, complemented with four archival databases, bolster these inferences. Overall, the results show that supplier environmental responsibility can be fostered through both stakeholder pressures and relational drivers; whereas, supplier social responsibility is much harder to address. The integrated methods offer a fuller, more comprehensive understanding of the specifics of supplier responsibility in China and also provide recommendations for MNCs that seek to improve it. © 2020 The Authors.

People constantly try to get better, in practically all aspects of their personal and professional life, and thus OR is de facto a ubiquitous science. What might however not be that clear, is that the way we improve is driven by the very OR science, and the scientific results that constitute the respective body of literature, theory and practice. Of all the tasks, that can be related to the OR science, the one that more frequently we do, is forecasting. We do constantly try to estimate what is coming next, and we drive our decisions for each and every situation based on these forecasts: from where to put our money to who will be the best surgeon to operate us. Within the broad boundaries of OR, forecasting stands out as the most ubiquitous sub-discipline. In the forecasting literature, a lot of attention has been given to modeling fast-moving time series and building causal models; however, very limited attention has been given to intermittent time series and intermittent demand forecasting. In this research, we advocate for the broader use of intermittent demand forecasting methods for forecasting special events, as a simpler, faster, and robust alternative to more complex non-OR models. Furthermore, in a foresight context, we argue for a novel way of deciding the strategic planning horizon for phenomena prone to appearance of special events. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; Foresight; Intermittent demand; Special events; Ubiquitousness","Professional aspects; Time series; Foresight; Intermittent demand; Intermittent time series; Limited attentions; Operational research; Special events; Theory and practice; Ubiquitousness; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078836389

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of FinTech products (FTPs) on commercial bank's performance in China. Required data are collected with a quantitative approach and two self-designed questionnaires were distributed to customers and employees of commercial banks in China. The gathered data were examined using the structural equation modeling technique. The results of this study reveal that the perceived usefulness (PU) of FTPs has positive and significant impacts on customer satisfaction, low expectation of bank employee assistance, bank's service quality and employee work efficiency. Additionally, the perceived difficulty of use (PD) of FTPs has negative and significant impacts on customer satisfaction and low expectation of assistance. Interestingly, there is a positive and significant relationship between PD and banks' service quality and work efficiency, meaning that the service quality and work efficiency can reduce some shortcomings of using FTPs. This study recognizes the need to enhance the understanding of FTPs on non-financial firm performance. This is the first study that helps commercial banks in China understand the perception of FTPs from both customer and employee perspectives. © 2021","Commercial banks; Customer expectation; Customer satisfaction; Fintech; Firm performance; Service quality; Work efficiency","Banking; Efficiency; Fintech; Personnel; Quality of service; Sales; Surveys; Banking industry; Firm Performance; Perceived difficulties; Perceived usefulness; Quantitative approach; Service Quality; Structural equation modeling techniques; Survival-of-the-Fittest; Customer satisfaction; banking; consumption behavior; COVID-19; financial services; industrial performance; performance assessment; service quality; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100258797

Academic/practical relevance: The problem involves complex planning and operational decisions, as well as multiple sources of uncertainties. The related optimization models impose significant computational challenges. The potential value of V2G integration may have far-reaching impacts on EV sharing and sustainability. Methodology: We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer linear program. In the first stage, we optimize decisions related to service planning, the capacity of parking and charging facilities, EV battery capacities, and EV allocation in each zone under uncertain time-dependent trip demand and electricity prices. In the second stage, for a realized demand price scenario, we construct a time-And-charging-status expanded transportation network and optimize operations of the shared vehicle fleet, EV battery charging, and V2G selling. We develop Benders decomposition and scenario decomposition approaches to improve computational efficiency. A linear-decision-rule-based approximation approach is also provided to model dynamic operations. Results: Via testing instances based on real-world and synthetic data, we demonstrate the computational efficacy of our approaches and study the benefits of integrating V2G in EV sharing from the service provider, consumer, and socioenvironmental aspects. Managerial implications: V2G integration can significantly increase the profitability of EV sharing and the quality of service. It results in the preference of larger EV fleets and battery capacities, which further leads to various socioenvironmental benefits. The benefit of V2G can still prevail, even with more severe battery degradation and can be more significant when combined with (i) more stringent service levels, (ii) more traffic congestion, or (iii) urban spatial structures with concentrated business/residential areas. V2G integration (complemented by fast charging technology) can also benefit carshare users through improvement in the quality of service. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This study applies the concepts of generational cohort theory to the US wine market to examine similarities and differences between age cohorts and their potential impact on future wine sales. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey was conducted with a quota sample of 1,136 US wine consumers located in all 50 states. Data analysis included one-way ANOVA analysis to test the null hypothesis that the generational cohort means are equal. If the test detected at least one mean difference across cohorts, then pairwise comparisons were performed to identify, which groups differed. The Tukey–Kramer method was used for all post hoc tests. Basic descriptive statistics were also calculated. Findings: The results show some parallels in terms of similar consumption levels and a higher preference for red wine across all cohorts. However, on the majority of other common wine consumer research topics, Gen Z shows significant differences. Of specific interest, Gen Z consumers report higher levels of preference for sparkling wine than other cohorts; prefers to drink in social situations; are much more interested in labels and package; make decisions based on varietal and alcohol level and are much more engaged on Instagram and Snapchat social media platforms – all pointed to new marketing tactics needed to reach this new consumer segment. Originality/value: This is the first empirical wine research study to explore the wine preferences and behaviors of Gen Z in the US market. This is valuable because Gen Z is a very large population of consumers, comprising 32% of the world population (Miller and Wei, 2018) and already represent more than $143bn in buying power (Dill, 2015). They are expected to have a huge impact on consumer products, not only in the USA but also on a global basis. Given that the USA is currently the largest wine market in the world in both volume and value (Wine Institute, 2019; VinExpo, 2018), it is important that research is conducted on this new and powerful generation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gen Z; Generation cohort theory; Market segmentation; Market segmentation; Survey research; Surveys; United States of America; Wine consumer behavior; Wines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085885154

As such, IT investment facilitates a firm’s problemistic search that generates innovation in response to performance gaps. We further examine the role of innovation outputs as a mediating mechanism linking IT investment to firm performance.

We also show that the marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04 °C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement goals, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01 °C per annum, reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries depending on the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions.

Yet, while aligning with the platform ecosystem rules, each member must decide whether to specialize in a given platform ecosystem or across multiple platform ecosystems to capture these benefits. We examine two common patterns through which platform ecosystem members (i.e., complementors) specialize within and across platform ecosystems, and the relative impact on their market performance. We look at the high relative standing of the complementary product as a reflection of complementors' specialization in the given product category or platform ecosystem. We then theorize that having products with high relative standing in a single product category and a single platform ecosystem, together, diminishes complementors’ market performance over time. Similarly, high relative standing in multiple platform ecosystems and multiple product categories, at the same time, adversely impacts the market performance. We find supportive evidence for our hypotheses, in a panel dataset of mobile app developers. This paper contributes to the burgeoning stream of research that investigates the trade-offs faced by complementors, suggesting that complementor strategies are more complex than simply trying to maximize market reach. © 2020","Complementors; Digital platform; Mobile app developer; Platform ecosystem; Specialization","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Complementary products; Digital platforms; Market opportunities; Market performance; Multiple platforms; Multiple products; Platform ecosystems; Product categories; Ecosystems; complementarity; performance assessment; software; specialization; technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083592905

However, an accurate prediction of salinity concentration in groundwater remains a challenge due to the complexity of groundwater salinization processes and its influencing factors. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting groundwater salinity and identify its influencing factors. We conducted a study for the coastal multi-layer aquifers of the Mekong River Delta (Vietnam), using a geodatabase of 216 groundwater samples and 14 conditioning factors. We compared the predictive performances of different ML techniques, i.e., the Random Forest Regression (RFR), the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR), the CatBoost Regression (CBR), and the Light Gradient Boosting Regression (LGBR) models. The model performance was assessed by using root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results show that the CBR model has the highest performance with both training (R2 = 0.999, RMSE = 29.90) and testing datasets (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 205.96, AIC = 720.60, and BIC = 751.04). Ten of the 14 influencing factors, including the distance to saline sources, the depth of screen well, the groundwater level, the vertical hydraulic conductivity, the operation time, the well density, the extraction capacity, the thickness of the aquitard, the distance to fault, and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors for groundwater salinity prediction. The results provide insights for policymakers in proposing remediation and management strategies for groundwater salinity issues in the context of excessive groundwater exploitation in coastal lowland regions. Since the human-induced influencing factors have significantly influenced groundwater salinization, urgent actions should be taken into consideration to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the coastal areas of the Mekong River Delta. © 2021 The Authors","CatBoost Regression; Groundwater salinization; Influencing factors; Mekong Delta; Multi-layer coastal aquifers","Aquifers; Decision trees; Forecasting; Groundwater resources; Hydraulic conductivity; Hydrogeology; Machine learning; Mean square error; Salt water intrusion; Water management; Catboost regression; Groundwater salinities; Groundwater salinizations; Influencing factor; Machine learning algorithms; Mekong Delta; Multi-layer coastal aquifer; Multi-layers; Root mean square errors; Viet Nam; Regression analysis; algorithm; coastal aquifer; detection method; hydraulic conductivity; machine learning; salinity; Mekong Delta; Mekong River; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105865850

Thus, this paper aims to explore the nature of blockchain technology under varying conditions for consumer benefits. Academic and press articles followed by interviews from industry experts were used to explore the nature of blockchain technology (BCT) for the hospitality and tourism sector (HTS). A hybrid research methodology is proposed to investigate the criticality of factors, their hierarchical model, and cause & effect relationships. 35 Employees from two geographies, namely India (N=17) and Netherlands (N=18) in hospitality and tourism firms, were interviewed. In the next step, the expert opinions were collected using the Analytic hierarchy process - Interpretive Structural Modeling- Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ISM-DEMATEL) technique. A forward-looking approach was adopted by considering the implications of barriers and drivers on the adoption of BCT and thereby benefiting HTS. The results suggest that ‘low cost’ and ‘risk management’ are the key drivers with driving power of 1 and 10 in Indian and the Netherlands, respectively. They are placed at I and VI hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group. ‘Lack of Government Regulation/ Policy’ and ‘Market Uncertainty’ are the critical barriers with driving power 9 and 10 in the Indian and Netherlands context, respectively. They are placed at V and III hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,"Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Risk management; Block-chain; Cause-effect; Condition; Consumer benefits; Disruptive technology; Driving power; Netherlands; Operational efficiencies; Technology assessments; Tourism sectors; Blockchain; efficiency measurement; hospitality industry; innovation; technological change; tourism development; tourism market; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105095333

An empirical survey was conducted in Montenegro on the sample of 813 millennial consumers by using Structural Equation Modeling and the analysis of the variance (ANOVA) test. The results revealed that Millennials are satisfied with previous experience in online shopping. They perceive it beneficial compared to purchase in traditional shops, but also perceive it as very risky, which is why they buy online mostly inexpensive products. The results also suggested that behavior of millennial consumers in the online purchase significantly depends on their demographic characteristics. While the frequency of online shopping is the same for both genders, male consumers spend more money on it compared to women. Also, men to a greater extent prefer doing the online shopping using more famous websites, than women do. The amount spent in online shopping does not depend on age of consumers, but younger Millennials do this type of purchase more often compared to older Millennials. Based on the results, this paper provides implications for managers important for building the trust of consumers and increase of online sales. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Consumers' behavior; e-business; Millennials; Montenegro; Online shopping","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Electronic commerce; Sales; Analysis of the variances; Demographic characteristics; E-business development; Empirical surveys; Key determinants; Online sales; Online shopping; Structural equation modeling; Consumer behavior; business development; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; shopping activity; Montenegro",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102621173

Considering pre- and post-disruption scenarios, this study proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization framework with multiple resilience strategies for designing a resilient retail supply chain. We consider facility fortification, inventory prepositioning, direct-to-store delivery, reserved capacity, inventory sharing and multiple set covering as our resilience strategies, covering all the three dimensions of resilience capabilities, namely, proactive, reactive, and network design quality. Taking into account the prominent role of retail outlets during Covid-19 epidemic outbreaks, through a real case study, we evaluate the impact of random and targeted disruptions on the performance of the retail supply chain network and provide managerial insights regarding the right balance between cost efficiency and resilience. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of these resilience capabilities in a number of simulated scenarios to show their applicability and importance under different disruptive situations. We show that when implemented concurrently, these resilience capabilities have a synergistic effect where the whole becomes larger than the sum of its parts. Subject to extensive stress testing, our results show that using any mixture of these resilience capabilities increases the retail network's resilience while considerably decreasing post-disruption costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Resilient network design; Stress testing; Supply chain disruptions; Supply chain resilience; Synergistic effect; Two-stage stochastic programming","Optimization; Supply chains; Cost efficiency; Inventory sharing; Reserved capacity; Resilience strategy; Retail supply chain; Stochastic optimizations; Synergistic effect; Three dimensions; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100388149

Due to cognitive and strategic biases, investors are likely to pay more attention to unfamiliar explorative patents rather than incremental exploitative patents. We find that innovative firms focusing on exploitation rather than exploration tend to generate superior subsequent short-term operating performance. Analysts do not seem to detect this, as firms currently focused on exploitation tend to outperform the market’s near-term earnings expectations. The stock market also seems unable to accurately incorporate information about a firm’s innovation search strategy. We find that firms with exploitation strategies are undervalued relative to firms with exploration strategies and that this return differential is incremental to standard risk and innovation-based pricing factors examined in the prior literature. This result suggests a more nuanced view on whether stock market pressure hampers innovation, and may have implications for optimal firm financing choices and corporate disclosure policy.

Bringing together experience from across five European nations (the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland), this paper outlines what has occurred between September 2020 and mid-January 2021. Our analysis draws out several themes important to understanding the different national risk management approaches adopted, namely: the extent to which lessons were learned or overlooked from the first wave of the pandemic; the relationship between science and policy; the speed and responsiveness of policy decisions; and differing levels of reliance on individual responsibility for safeguarding public health. Subsequently, we recommended that: there is more involvement of decision scientists and risk analysts in COVID-19 decision making, who have largely been absent thus far; the epidemiological science should be followed where possible, but when value judgments are made this should be clearly and transparently communicated; proactive measures avoiding policy delay should be followed to reduce the rate of infection and excess deaths; governments must avoid confusing or inconsistent regional implementation and communication of interventions; rebuilding public trust is key to promoting public compliance and support for COVID-19 health measures; overreliance on individual responsibility as the focus of non-pharmaceutical interventions should be avoided; public compliance with COVID-19 restrictions requires pre-tested simple messages; open and consistent engagement with local leaders and officials should become a mainstay of government efforts to help ensure consistent adoption of nationwide COVID-19 policy measures. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; European risk management; health policy; winter lockdown","Binary alloys; Health risks; Population statistics; Potassium alloys; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uranium alloys; Government efforts; Health measures; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Policy decisions; Policy measures; Proactive measures; Rate of infections; Value judgment; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106181678

The method is valid in models with homogeneous or heterogeneous coefficients. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that under the null hypothesis, the Granger-causation parameters are all equal to zero, and thus they are homogeneous. Therefore, we put forward a pooled least-squares (fixed effects type) estimator for these parameters only. Pooling over cross sections guarantees that the estimator has a NT convergence rate. In order to account for the well-known “Nickell bias”, the approach makes use of the well-known Split Panel Jackknife method. Subsequently, a Wald test is proposed, which is based on the bias-corrected estimator. Finite-sample evidence shows that the resulting approach performs well in a variety of settings and outperforms existing procedures. Using a panel data set of 350 U.S. banks observed during 56 quarters, we test for Granger non-causality between banks’ profitability and cost efficiency. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bias correction; Fixed effects; Granger causality; Panel data; VAR; “Nickell bias”","banking; error correction; Granger causality test; panel data; profitability; regression analysis; time series analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096435117

Public campaigns exist to expand use of recyclable cups and to eliminate plastic straws. Retailers supplying 80% of the market are now members of the UK Plastics Pact, with goals to ensure that products are designed to be recycled, that recycling takes place, and that more recyclate is used in new products. Public awareness has not translated into action, as domestic collection rates for discarded plastics remain pitifully low. We started with a systems-wide vision that these rates can only be increased if all household plastic recycling is made easy and consistent christened ‘One Bin to Rule Them All’ - and used this premise as a starting point to examine the implications of a fully mixed plastics waste stream entering the supply chain. An agenda for future research was developed through 25 interviews with senior industrial and commercial management and a cross-sector workshop. We determined that if improved household collection rates are to translate into significantly improved recycling rates, rapid progress is required in four areas: standardisation (materials, kerbside collections, waste sorting), infrastructure investment, development of cross-supply chain business models and creation of higher value recyclate. Creating a harmonised national solution to plastic waste sorting is critically dependent on maintaining value in discarded plastics. This in turn reduces plastic leakage into the environment. Enabling this value-based scenario in the UK would form a best-practice model for other regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular Economy of plastic; Collaborative business models; Mixed plastic recycling; Plastic waste sorting","Bins; Elastomers; Industrial research; Investments; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Supply chains; Best practices; Business models; Collection rates; Commercial management; Infrastructure investment; Plastics recycling; Public awareness; Public campaign; Plastic recycling; plastic; business; modeling; plastic waste; recycling; sorting; waste management; Article; awareness; domestic waste; industrial waste; interview; recycling; standardization; United Kingdom; waste disposal; waste management; workshop; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091978279

The present study aims to standardize the evaluation criteria for the stakeholders to ensure sustainable environmental development by safe disposal of infectious healthcare waste (HCW). The present study applied the fuzzy-Delphi method to scrutinize the criteria identified from the literature and experts' opinions and resulted in 20 subcriteria under the following six main dimensions: experience, relationship, environmental factors, technology and qualification, economic factors, and firm's capabilities. Further, this study proposed a hybrid approach based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) under fuzzy environment to analyze the importance and interrelationships of these listed criteria. The study also showed that the experts have given approximately 70% weightage to three main criteria: firms' capabilities, economic factors, and technology and qualification. The implications of the study would help the healthcare administration and Pollution Control Boards to prepare check sheets for recording HCWM practices and, hence, contribute to sustainable environmental development in an efficient way.

Yet, due to the complex structure of SLM machines and low processing rates, the SLM process is highly energy-intensive. Energy forecasting is crucial for accurate evaluation and reduction of SLM energy consumption. However, due to the diversity of SLM machines and their various operating states, the energy consumption of SLM processes is difficult to predict. This article presents a novel method to forecast the energy consumption of SLM processes. The proposed approach is based on the power modelling of machine subsystems and the temporal modelling of sub-processes. Through identifying the working statuses of subsystems of SLM machines in each sub-process, forecast accuracy can be greatly improved. Two cases of aluminium components fabricated by an SLM process using an SLM 280HL facility are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method outperforms specific, stage-based and subsystem-based energy benchmark models in energy consumption forecasting. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; energy consumption; energy saving; selective laser melting","3D printers; Additives; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Laser applications; Melting; 3-D printing; Complex structure; Energy benchmarks; Energy forecasting; Forecast accuracy; Operating state; Processing rates; Selective laser melting (SLM); Selective laser melting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080993770

As a result, scholars end up using different scales to measure the same outcome variable of project success, thereby causing inconsistency in research results. Existing project success evaluation models suffer from their inability to apply to all project types and lack of separation of project success measurement from that of project individuals' performance (for e.g., of the project manager). Through two longitudinal studies based on the satisficing theory, this paper develops, validates, and illustrates generic scales to measure the success of any project, as well as the performance of its two key leaders. This results in three distinct project success dimensions: 1) Project management success-evaluates the performance of the project manager in achieving the project plan; 2) Project ownership success-evaluates the performance of the project owner in realizing the business case; and 3) Project investment success-evaluates the investment performance of the project for its funder. This paper contributes to the literature by offering a theoretically robust, multidimensional evaluation model that will enhance performance evaluation of both projects and their leaders. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Operations and management; performance evaluation; product development; project management; software development management","Aggregates; Investments; Managers; Product development; Societies and institutions; Software design; Investment performance; Longitudinal study; Multi-dimensional evaluations; performance evaluation; Project management success; Research results; Software development management; Stakeholders; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070394078

Retailers can leverage the blurred lines between the channels and adopt a business model that best suits the industry, such as having a virtual online showcase and letting the customers pick up the products in person or having an offline showroom and having products delivered to customers. The latter concept, in which information about products is gathered in a store or a showroom and fulfillment is made via delivery to customers, is particularly suitable when the customers prefer to experience the products in person to gain sufficient confidence in their potential purchase. This is often the case for high-value large products with high shipping costs. In this context, we propose a quantitative approach to optimize the showcasing portfolio for a given retailer to maximize the exposure of the features that customers expect to experience from a visit to a showroom. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem to maximize the expected customer showcasing utility through module and product showcasing and product testing. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we conduct a case study based on real data obtained from 17 dealerships of our industrial partner, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles. The numerical results of this case study show that the expected showcasing utility for a retailer can significantly increase, even in the presence of spatial and/or budget constraints. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Mixed-Integer programming; Omnichannel retailing; Optimization; Showcasing","Automobile manufacture; Budget control; Integer programming; Budget constraint; Business modeling; Industrial partners; Mixed integer optimization; Numerical results; Product testing; Quantitative approach; Recreational vehicles; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083729991

Also, the connections between the stakeholders' backgrounds and the 64 factors were explored and illustrated by a Sankey diagram. Lastly, a deeper analysis was performed, exploring the relationships between the 64 factors and five entities, including stakeholders, asset lifecycle, material circularity, regulations, and facilitating technologies. As a result, this research further clarifies the impacts of the CE approach on five entities and organises the factors and their dynamics in an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), being the main contribution to the theoretical foundations.

We assume a personalized demand model, parameters of which depend on s out of the d features. The seller initially does not know the relationship between the customer features and the product demand but learns this through sales observations over a selling horizon of T periods. We prove that the seller’s expected regret, that is, the revenue loss against a clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand relationship, is at least of order s√- T under any admissible policy. We then design a near-optimal pricing policy for a semiclairvoyant seller (who knows which s of the d features are in the demand model) who achieves an expected regret of order s√- T log T. We extend this policy to a more realistic setting, where the seller does not know the true demand predictors, and show that this policy has an expected regret of order s√- T (log d + log T), which is also near-optimal. Finally, we test our theory on simulated data and on a data set from an online auto loan company in the United States. On both data sets, our experimentation-based pricing policy is superior to intuitive and/or widely-practiced customized pricing methods, such as myopic pricing and segment-then-optimize policies. Furthermore, our policy improves upon the loan company’s historical pricing decisions by 47% in expected revenue over a six-month period. © 2021 INFORMS.","Demand learning; Demand uncertainty; Dynamic pricing; Lasso; Machine learning; Regret analysis","Costs; Machine learning; Sales; Statistical tests; Dynamic pricing; Expected revenue; Feature vectors; High dimensional feature; Individual customers; Near-optimal pricing; Pricing decision; Pricing methods; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114497663

The findings indicate a particularly strong tourism seasonality impact, suggesting the presence of common negative externalities, such as employment fluctuations, difficulties in maintaining economic status, and revenue instabilities, in localities prone to seasonal tourism fluctuations. © 2021 The Authors","Croatia; Dynamic panel model; Housing affordability; Tourism intensity","affordable housing; housing market; numerical model; tourism market; tourist destination; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109354443

That is why various countries have set up plans to move towards the Circular Economy (CE) leading the construction sector to adopt new approaches for ensuring to close the loop of building materials. This paper explores the socio-economic and environmental barriers for the implementation of the CE, in a BIM environment. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with a range of stakeholders involved in the asset lifecycle, experts in BIM or in sustainable approaches, to understand the obstacles to the holistic consideration of the asset lifecycle in the CE context. A descriptive interpretative analysis was used for the interviews' transcripts to identify common themes and sub-themes. A pattern-matching method was used for seeking the similarities and differences between the twenty stakeholders’ views and the literature. The study shows thirty-four new barriers identified by the interviewees and not found in the literature. Recommendations are given for accelerating the asset lifecycle reconsideration and the CE embracement. © 2021","Barriers; BIM; Building information modelling; Circular economy; End-of-Life; Sustainability","Architectural design; Construction industry; Economics; Linear systems; Pattern matching; 'current; Asset lifecycle; Barrier; BIM; Building Information Modelling; Circular economy; End of lives; Matching methods; Pattern-matching; Socio-economics; Sustainable development; construction industry; construction material; economic system; environmental economics; holistic approach; life cycle analysis; modeling; natural resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107853416

Technological interventions, such as social media analytics, big data, Internet of Things, and blockchain can help social businesses by leveraging the practices towards financial and operational sustainability. This study is the first of its kind in that it analyses existing scholarly works on social businesses using bibliometric analysis. In so doing, this paper presents an in-depth statistical analysis of the literature on technological interventions in sustainable social business, showcasing the development of the scholarship, major themes, and possible future research trajectories. The SCOPUS database is used to identify a large section of articles. The study shows that most of the work in social business has been done by scholars based in developed countries, with limited contributions emanating from developing countries. The study proposes a framework for the use of technology in sustainable social businesses with focus areas of research such as social innovation, digital technology, information systems, and decision making for sustainability. The results show that digital technologies are increasingly being accepted as tools for the sustainability and scalability of social businesses.

Our primary motivation comes from the fact that disasters in Brazil are often associated with unequal distribution of opportunities and social inequalities that end up pushing more vulnerable people to risky areas or informal settlements. Moreover, investment in disaster management has dropped over the past few years in Brazil. In this way, we wonder: how to use the somewhat limited financial budget as effectively as possible towards meeting those that need the most while addressing disaster preparedness activities? To answer this question, we develop an optimization model to address location, capacity planning, prepositioning, local procurement, and relief aid flows’ decisions. Differently from most existing research, we adopt the so-called Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) in the objective function to build enhanced response capacity in more vulnerable areas when the lack of resources makes impassable to fulfil all victims’ needs at once. Through a rich and real case-study based on the Brazilian Humanitarian Supply Chain, we come up with critical insights that can help to improve the humanitarian supply chain practices in the country. In particular, we show that the social benefit of using SoVI is as more significant as the vulnerability increases, which reveals the importance of considering this index to design more social-effective humanitarian supply chains. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Disaster preparedness; Humanitarian logistics and supply chain; OR in disaster relief; Social vulnerability index","Budget control; Disaster prevention; Economic and social effects; Supply chains; Disaster management; Disaster preparedness; Informal settlements; Objective functions; Optimization modeling; Social inequalities; Social vulnerability index; Supply chain practices; Emergency services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096176524

The service platform can improve the performance of the retail channel by investing in retail service. The supplier decides whether to encroach on the retail market by opening a direct channel on the platform. We analyze the interaction between the platform's service investment strategy and the supplier's encroachment decision by establishing a game model. We then compare the payoffs of the firms under different service investment strategies and find that the platform benefits from supplier encroachment in several cases. The benefit not only comes from the reduction of the double marginal effect but also from the share of profits that the supplier earns from the direct channel. A spillover effect can be observed in the platform's service investment. The spillover effect causes the increased profits generated by such investment to transfer to the supplier, ultimately resulting in that the service investment by the platform does not necessarily create more revenue for itself, but increases the supplier's profit. Results indicate that a platform's investment in retail service is not always intended to prevent supplier encroachment. In some cases, such investment is meant to induce a supplier to encroach through the platform. Robustness analysis shows that the main results derived in the basic model hold. Managerial implications are then discussed and provided. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Channel selection; Platform service supply chain; Retail service investing; Service platform; Supplier encroachment","Investments; Profitability; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Channel selection; Direct channel; Investment strategy; Online platforms; Platform service supply chain; Retail service investing; Retail services; Service platforms; Spillover effects; Supplier encroachment; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102270185

The demand of customers and inventory control variables are affected by greening programs. The primary objective of this paper is to determine the optimal sales price, replenishment schedule, and order quantity per inventory cycle under different greenness levels, which will help maximize the vendor's total profit. The problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization model in which an analytical approach is applied in order to find the optimal solution. Using several mathematical theorems, it has been proven that the optimal solution not only exists but also is unique. In order to show the efficacy of the proposed model, a real case study in the round beef industry is analyzed. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to help find managerial insights.

Many customers use on-demand service platforms to order services and then post online reviews. Using text-mining approaches, this study examines customers' online review-writing behavior and their overall satisfaction with restaurants in the context of on-demand food service. We use customers' overall ratings in their reviews to measure their overall satisfaction. We find that customers comment on the main service provider, the restaurants, and the auxiliary service providers, which include the drivers and on-demand service platform; in their online customer reviews, which are posted on the restaurants' web pages on the on-demand service platform. From text regressions, we found the determinants of customer satisfaction with the restaurants through their online reviews. There is a spillover effect from the performance of auxiliary providers on customer satisfaction with the main provider. That is, the performance of the drivers and the platform affects customers' overall satisfaction with the restaurants. In addition, we find that a higher cost of the order makes customers comment more on the attributes offered by the restaurants to show their overall satisfaction. Further, we find the type of listed merchants categorized by their properties (i.e., chain or independent) and participation in the platform programs affect the influence of the various attributes, offered by different providers, on customer satisfaction with the main provider.

The main objective is to maximize the total profit of the Supply Chain (SC) by considering the profitability of entities. In this regard, two kinds of selling channels (i.e. online and in-person) are extended to enable all the entities to sell the product through their own channels. Demands in both types of channels depend on price, greenness, and advertisement. In the studied SC, the manufacturer not only produces the products and sells them to the distributor and the customer but it also decides on the greening and advertising levels. As a contribution, the demand functions simultaneously consider environmental and financial issues. Besides, since each member has its own selling channel, it should determine the price based on three criteria: advertising costs, greening costs, and other members' pricing decisions. For this purpose, three models including Centralized Supply Chain (CSC), Decentralized Supply Chain (DCSC), and Modified Centralized Supply Chain (MCSC) are developed and then solved to cope with various real-world situations. Based on the findings, although the SC gains the most profitability under the CSC model, the manufacturer faces a considerable loss. To overcome this issue, the MCSC model ensures the manufacturer's profit while keeping the price, greenness, and advertisement competitive. Also, the profitability of the MCSC model is more than that of under the DCSC model. The proposed models' performance for different situations is corroborated using several examples and various analyses, along with a real case study. The results acknowledge the applicability of the models and give practical insights for experts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising levels; Green products; Multi-channel; Multi-level supply chain; Revenue management","advertising; decision making; environmentalism; marketing; pricing policy; profitability; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098194789

To test these hypotheses, interviews with 20 scuba divers and a field survey with the participation of 426 scuba diving tourists were conducted in Kaş, Turkey. The findings reveal that the influence of the flow experience on storytelling intentions of scuba diving tourists is fully mediated by their satisfaction.

Collaboration was measured by three constructs: horizontal collaboration, vertical collaboration, and customer engagement and SME performance with three variables: growth, value for money and innovativeness. Two strategies were evaluated: price strategy and quality strategy. Three types of scale constraints were assessed: financial, efficiency, and innovation. A survey of 504 agri-SMEs was conducted to test the research hypotheses developed according to the resource based view. Data analysis included a moderated hierarchical analysis. The results show that supply chain collaboration impacts positively on agri-SME performance, whilst it is partially accepted that scale constraints moderate the supply chain collaboration-SME performance relationship. The findings show that SME strategy moderates the supply chain collaboration-SME performance relationship. This study provides evidence that agri-SMEs can strategize their supply chain collaborations by removing scale constraints. When supply chain collaborations help SMEs to overcome financial, efficiency or innovation constraints, then SMEs’ performance improves. Second, this study contributes to the understanding of dynamic capabilities in SMEs using the extended resource based view, which has been overlooked by prior studies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agri-SMEs; firm performance; scale constraints; strategy; supply chain collaboration; survey","Efficiency; Food supply; Quality control; Agri-food supply chains; Dynamic capabilities; Hierarchical analysis; Price strategies; Quality strategy; Resource-based view; Supply chain collaboration; Vertical collaborations; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088837558

Failures in implementing e-government interventions suggest the lack of an integrated approach in understanding e-government as a discipline. In this study, we present an overarching and integrated conceptual framework of e-government grounded in robust qualitative research to describe the factors that must be integrated to implement e-government successfully. Drawing insights from 168 in-depth interviews conducted with multiple stakeholders in India, this study defines e-government as a multidimensional construct with customer orientation, channel orientation and technology orientation as its antecedents. Building on customer orientation and relationship marketing theories, this study proposes that the most significant factor impacting success in implementing e-government projects is citizen orientation, followed by channel orientation and technology orientation. The study also identifies the digital divide, economic growth and political stability as moderators of e-government. Furthermore, the study proposes the tangible and intangible outcomes of e-government with perceived privacy and shared understanding as moderating conditions.

The aim of this paper is to identify the determinants of logistics performance and investigate its empirical linkages with economic and environmental indicators. We built a macro-level dataset for the top 25 ranked logistics countries from 2007 to 2018, conducting a set of panel data tests on cross-sectional dependence, stationarity and cointegration, to provide preliminary insights. Empirical estimates from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and Quantile Regression (QR) model suggest that technological innovation, Human Development Index (HDI), urbanization, and trade openness significantly boost logistic performance, whereas employment and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) fail to respond in such a desirable path. In turn, an increase in the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) is found to worsen economic growth. Finally, LPI exhibits a large positive effect on carbon emissions, which is congruent with a strand of the literature highlighting that the modern supply chain is far from being decarbonized. Thus, this evidence further suggest that more global efforts should be geared to attain a sustainable logistics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Green supply chain management; Logistics performance; Panel data; Quantile regression","Coronavirus; Economic and social effects; Economics; Least squares approximations; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Supply chain management; CO 2 emission; Economic growths; Environmental quality; Green supply chain management; Logistic performance; Panel data; Performance indices; Performance quality; Quantile regression; Technological innovation; Method of moments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115358002

The analysis is also conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate that over the full and before the pandemic periods, oil returns cause the renewable stock index returns during normal market conditions, but this is not the case in the extreme market conditions. Moreover, all the five renewable energy sectoral stock returns have no predictive power of oil returns under any market conditions. On the other hand, the volatility analysis suggests a significant bidirectional causality between the oil price volatility and the renewable energy stock volatility only at the lower quantiles during the same periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the findings suggest the absence of significant causal relationships between the oil price (returns and volatility) and the renewable energy stocks. However, the causal relationship during the pre-COVID-19 period is close to that reported for the full period.

Our review contributes to ongoing debates over decarbonisation, a politically sensitive and crucial aspect of the energy transition, and one that could exacerbate patterns of inequality or vulnerability. Up to 125 million people across the European Union experience the effects of energy poverty in their daily lives. A more comprehensive understanding of the breadth and depth of these conditions is therefore paramount. This review assessed 1,134 articles and critically analysed a deeper sample of 93. In terms of the use of metrics, we find that multiple indicators are better than any single metric or composite. We find work remains to be conducted in the transport poverty sphere before energy poverty metrics can be fully unified with those of transport poverty, namely the stipulation of travel standards. Without such standards, our ability to unify the metrics of both fields and potentially alleviate both conditions simultaneously is limited. The difficulties in defining necessary travel necessitate the further use of vulnerability lenses and holistic assessments focused on energy and transport services. © 2021 The Authors","Energy; Energy justice; Fuel; Just transition; Metrics; Operationalise; Poverty","Computer programming; Economic and social effects; Fueling; Condition; Decarbonisation; Energy; Energy justices; Energy poverties; Just transition; Metric; Operationalize; Poverty; State of the art; Fuels; energy market; European Union; living standard; poverty; service quality; transportation system; travel behavior; vulnerability; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108259244

Investor sentiment remained a mystery and challenge over time, inviting researchers to comprehend the market trends. The entry of behavioral scientists in and around the 1980s brought in the market trading’s human dimensions. Shortly after that, due to the digitization of exchanges, the mix of traders changed as institutional traders started using algorithmic trading (AT) on computers. Nevertheless, the effects of investor sentiment did not disappear and continued to intrigue market researchers. Though market sentiment plays a significant role in timing investment decisions, classical finance models largely ignored the role of investor sentiment in asset pricing. For knowing if the market price is value-driven, the investor would isolate components of irrationality from the price, as reflected in the sentiment. Investor sentiment is an expression of irrational expectations of a stock’s risk-return profile that is not justified by available information. In this context, the paper aims to predict the next-day trend in the index prices for the centralized Indian National Stock Exchange (NSE) deploying machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks. The training set is historical NSE closing price data from June 1st, 2013-June 30th, 2020.

We investigate if adding female directors to a firm's board of directors changes whether and how quickly the firm recalls defective products. Academic/ practical relevance: By demonstrating a relationship between an increase in female directors and more rule-conscious, customer-focused recall decisions, we highlight that adding female directors may enable more societally beneficial operational decisions. Methodology: We analyze 4,271 medical product recalls from2002 to 2013 across 92 publicly traded firms regulated by the Food and Drug Administration using negative binomial and ordinary least squares fixed effect regression models. In robustness checks, we include an instrumental variable analysis, propensity score matching models, and reverse causality regression models. Results: As boards add female directors, recall decisions change. Firms initiate more medical product recalls that are low in severity and hence easier for firms to avoid initiating, highlighting the increased rule-following brought to bear by adding female directors. Firms also make faster recall decisions for the most serious defects that are high in severity and dangerous for customers, highlighting the increased stakeholder responsiveness resulting from adding female directors. Managerial implications: Firms may more closely align recall decisions with regulatory rules and become more sensitized to customer health and safety by adding female directors. Further, at least two female directors may be required to speed up recall decisions for the most serious, lifethreatening defects. © 2020 INFORMS.","Econometric analysis; OM-organizational behavior interface; Public policy; Quality management","Defects; Public administration; Regression analysis; Sales; Board of directors; Food and Drug Administration; Instrumental variables; Managerial implications; Operational decisions; Operations management; Ordinary least squares; Propensity score matching; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113992333

With growing complexity of systems to be modelled, an increasing number of studies now apply multiple M&S techniques or hybrid simulation (HS) to represent the underlying system of interest. A parallel but related theme of research is extending the HS approach to include the development of hybrid models (HM). HM extends the M&S discipline by combining theories, methods and tools from across disciplines and applying multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary solutions to practice. In the broader OR literature, there are numerous examples of cross-disciplinary approaches in model development. However, within M&S, there is limited evidence of the application of conjoined methods for building HM. Where a stream of such research does exist, the integration of approaches is mostly at a technical level. In this paper, we argue that HM requires cross-disciplinary research engagement and a conceptual framework. The framework will enable the synthesis of discipline-specific methods and techniques, further cross-disciplinary research within the M&S community, and will serve as a transcending framework for the transdisciplinary alignment of M&S research with domain knowledge, hypotheses and theories from diverse disciplines. The framework will support the development of new composable HM methods, tools and applications.

Phishing threats against employees can lead to severe security incidents, whereas those against the public can undermine trust, satisfaction, and brand equity. At the root of the problem is the inability of Internet users to identify phishing attacks even when using anti-phishing tools. We propose the phishing funnel model (PFM), a design artifact for predicting user susceptibility to phishing websites. PFM incorporates user, threat, and tool-related factors to predict actions during four key stages of the phishing process: visit, browse, consider legitimate, and intention to transact. We used a support vector ordinal regression with a custom kernel encompassing a cumulative-link mixed model for representing users’ decisions across funnel stages. We evaluated the efficacy of PFM in a 12-month longitudinal field experiment in two organizations involving 1,278 employees and 49,373 phishing interactions. PFM significantly outperformed competing models/methods by 8%–52% in area under the curve, correctly predicting visits to high-severity threats 96% of the time—a result 10% higher than the nearest competitor. A follow-up three-month field study revealed that employees using PFM were significantly less likely to interact with phishing threats relative to comparison models and baseline warnings. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis showed that interventions guided by PFM resulted in phishing-related cost reductions of nearly $1,900 per employee more than comparison prediction methods. These results indicate strong external validity for PFM. Our findings have important implications for practice by demonstrating (1) the effectiveness of predicting user susceptibility to phishing as a real-time protection strategy, (2) the value of modeling each stage of the phishing process together, rather than focusing on a single user action, and (3) the considerable impact of anti-phishing tool and threat-related factors on susceptibility to phishing.

Six megaprojects that currently represent a combined investment of more than £100 Bn have been analysed through 171 interviews in the United Kingdom: High Speed One, Heathrow Airport Terminal 5, London 2012 Olympics, Crossrail, Thames Tideway Tunnel, and High Speed Two.

The results are as follows. First, the study revealed that Internet use is affected by household total land holdings, access to credit and off-farm employment, education, being a member of an association and how household perceives the use of the internet and household head age. Second, regarding the quantitative relationship, Internet use can help increase farm productivity. Compared with males, the impact of female heads’ Internet use on farm productivity is more prominent. Finally, the productivity effect of Internet use for farmers with no access to off-farm work is greater than that for those with off-farm work access.

With frequent user interactions, these platforms gradually evolve into virtual communities, and users subsequently form a sense of commitment. Nevertheless, previous research has ignored the effects of commitment on knowledge-sharing behaviors. This study thus endeavors to fill this research gap by exploring the effect of commitment on knowledge contributors’ sharing intentions in virtual communities in China. By integrating the commitment model and social exchange theory, we demonstrate that user commitment mediates the effect of social-exchange benefits on users’ knowledge exchange behaviors in virtual communities. Our research model is validated using 751 valid responses collected from four prevalent virtual communities through an online survey. The statistical results show that affective and normative commitment can significantly influence users’ knowledge-sharing intention. In addition, relationships, reputation, and reciprocity, as three types of social-exchange benefits, serve as crucial antecedents to user commitment. Our findings contribute to the literature on commitment and virtual communities by shedding important light on the different components of user commitment and their distinctive mediating roles in knowledge sharing. © 2020","Commitment; Knowledge-sharing intention; Reciprocity; Relationship; Reputation","Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Empirical studies; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge-sharing; Normative commitments; Online platforms; Social exchange theory; User interaction; Virtual community; Knowledge management; knowledge; social media; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095857834

The scale measures information preferences in three domains that are psychologically and materially consequential: consumer finance, personal characteristics, and health. In three studies incorporating responses from over 2,300 individuals, we present tests of the scale’s reliability and validity. We show that the scale predicts a real decision to obtain (or avoid) information in each of the domains as well as decisions from out-of-sample, unrelated domains.

As such, this paper develops a simulation framework to determine the bid decision that would result in the optimal outcomes in the long run. To this end, the authors used a research methodology based on an algorithmic game theory approach. First, data was collected for 982 US public construction projects. Second, a framework was formulated to represent the bidding decision-making process. Third, a comparison between three learning algorithms was performed, including the multiplicative weights, the exponential weights, and the Roth-Erev. Fourth, two bidding strategies were simulated: the first strategy aims to win more projects while the second strategy aims to reduce the cases the contractor might fall prey to negative profits (known as the winner's curse). The outcomes of this study demonstrated that integrating learning into construction bidding decision-making process (1) gives contractors competitive advantage over their competitors by either doubling their chance of winning more projects or reducing losses in the long run, and (2) benefits owners by ending-up paying less for their projects in the long run. Ultimately, this study adds to the body of knowledge by equipping contractors with a practical bidding framework that can be used in their bidding decision-making process to overcome the inherent complexities and uncertainties in the competitive construction bidding environment. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Competition; Concrete pavements; Contractors; Decision theory; Game theory; Learning algorithms; Algorithmic Game Theory; Bidding decision makings; Competitive advantage; Construction biddings; Inherent complexity; Public construction projects; Research methodologies; Simulation framework; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094613842

Such a positive impact can promote a more ambitious action plan for mitigating carbon emissions. This study investigates whether and how China's Three Gorges Project (TGP), the world's largest hydropower project, may affect the productivity of manufacturing firms in the province where the project is located. The empirical results reveal a statistically and economically significant positive impact of the TGP on manufacturing firms’ productivity, and various robustness checks confirm the soundness of our findings. We also verify three channels, the capital deepening effect, the scale effect, and the competition effect, robustly. This productivity impact suggests that hydropower projects have an economic benefit in addition to the other well-known ones, such as flood control and improvement of the shipping capacity. The findings imply that policy makers need to consider the broad benefits of green energy beyond the conventional cost-benefit tradeoff, which can help justify some marginal green energy projects and technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","DID; Hydropower; Infrastructure investment; Productivity; Three Gorges Project",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091974699

Their small size and high tourism-dependency make these small island states more vulnerable to such disruptions. Hence, understanding resilience or adaptive capacity to withstand shocks is fundamental to their sustainable development. The emerging literature uses the Adaptive Cycle Model to qualitatively analyse resilience through the evolution of tourism destinations. Nevertheless, the absence of quantitative studies using the Adaptive Cycle Model makes it a daunting task to adequately advise policymakers about the scope and scale of intervention necessary to facilitate the rebuilding of a stronger tourism industry. We, therefore, pioneer the use of Markov Switching Autoregressive Model to test the model’s applicability using four decades of data on tourist arrivals in two Caribbean destinations, Barbados and Grenada. The results reveal untapped opportunities for transformation and regeneration in both countries’ tourism industries, but highlight sharp contrast in their resilience capability. Grenada exhibits greater resilience as its adverse shocks, though deeper, are relatively transitory, while Barbados despite experiencing fewer external shocks faces prolonged repercussions from global recessions. For small islands, we conclude that the factors impacting lower resilience are the industry’s management deficiencies, inadequate cohesion among stakeholders, and lack of innovation. Overall, the findings present a modelling framework for tourism-dependent economies to determine how quickly they recover from major stress events, the associated strategies necessary to strengthen tourism resilience, and the potential to innovate in the tourism industry. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adaptive Cycle Model; Barbados; Caribbean; Grenada; Markov Switching Model; resilience; small island states; tourism; 恢复力; 旅游业","marketing; Markov chain; numerical model; small island state; tourism management; tourism market; tourist destination; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083782320

We develop a conceptual model of a BCT-driven tea supply chain, which we analyse using a partial least squares regression-based structural equation modelling method with data collected from 305 experts in India. The findings show that the use of BCT has a significant positive effect on the tea supply chain; in particular, transparency and reliability are shown as the sustainable performance parameters. The implementation of BCT is a progressive paradigm shift that encourages actors to change their attitudes and become more competent in the tea sector. This study is the first report on integrating BCT into supply chains, contributing to the scant literature on this subject.

However, while automation and artificial intelligence may improve productivity or wages for those who remain employed, they may also have mixed or negative impacts on worker well-being. This study considers five hypothetical channels through which automation may impact worker well-being: influencing worker freedom, sense of meaning, cognitive load, external monitoring, and insecurity. We apply a measure of automation risk to a set of 402 occupations to assess whether automation predicts impacts on worker well-being along the dimensions of job satisfaction, stress, health, and insecurity. Findings based on a 2002–2018 dataset from the General Social Survey reveal that workers facing automation risk appear to experience less stress, but also worse health, and minimal or negative impacts on job satisfaction. These impacts are more concentrated on workers facing the highest levels of automation risk. This article encourages new research directions by revealing important heterogeneous effects of technological complementarity. We recommend that firms, policymakers, and researchers not conceive of technological complementarity as a uniform good, and instead direct more attention to mixed well-being impacts of automation and artificial intelligence on workers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Technology adoption; Worker well-being","Artificial intelligence; Ergonomics; Facings; Health risks; Job satisfaction; Productivity; Risk assessment; Surveys; Cognitive loads; Future of works; Heterogeneous effects; Levels of automation; Policy makers; Social survey; Technology adoption; Well being; Worker well-being; Workers'; Automation; artificial intelligence; automation; innovation; research and development; technological development; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115796641

A hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) approach is proposed to determine the status of project activities in the presence of quality and risk criteria alongside time and cost. Afterwards, a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model is formulated for time, cost, quality, and risk trade-off (TCQRT). To validate the model, a research and development project in the food industry is investigated. The results indicate that the project's time compared to the deterministic approach was reduced by 20%. Completing the R&D project earlier than other competitors brings a higher profit for the company than trade-off expenses, even without considering the quality and risk trade-off benefits of the proposed approach. Considering uncertainty in the risk and quality of activities in a project via HFLTSs and optimizing all four elements of time, cost, quality, and risk simultaneously are the main values of this research.

The results show that China's demand for neodymium at the use stage had increased over 20 times during 2000-2017. By contrast, official neodymium production has only doubled, indicating the existence of illegal mining to meet the increasing neodymium demand. Also, the total net neodymium exports have continuously decreased due to reduced export of primary products and intermediate products. In addition, smuggling of primary products remains an issue and needs to be eliminated.

In response to these challenges, many retailers attempt to establish so-called ship-from-store concepts, which leverage their physical store networks to fulfill online orders. In this study, we analyze the optimal setup of these in-store fulfillment processes of online orders for an omni-channel retailer. We use a simulation-based approach combined with exploratory modeling to prescribe optimal fulfillment policies under a variety of sources of uncertainty. We apply our proposed model to a case study informed by real data from a leading sports fashion retailer in New York City in order to illustrate the practical applicability and value of our approach. Our results determine (i) the optimal amount of time to allow for batching of online orders prior to starting the in-store picking process; (ii) the optimal amount of time to allow for readily picked orders prior to starting the delivery process; (iii) the optimal number of pickers; and (iv) the optimal number of packers, and the related performance measures.

This phenomenon has called attention to the issue of continued WFT use, with emphasis on how the value of the WFT can be sustained. Using the concept of value co-creation, this research aims to understand the effects of actor-to-actor interactions on continued use of a WFT, with a specific focus on the interactions generated through two WFT services: choice and involvement of dietitians. Considering a WFT's service system as part of the greater healthcare ecosystem, this paper also considers the moderating role of self-efficacy in health management as an internal factor and healthcare system satisfaction as an external factor. A randomized experimentation using a scenario-based survey was conducted, and the data generated by 423 participants were analyzed. The results emphasize the significant positive effect of dietitian involvement on users’ intentions to continue using their WFT. Dietitian involvement not only improves continued use intention, but also realizes the effect of choice. The positive effect of dietitian involvement is robust, regardless of user satisfaction with the healthcare service system. Self-efficacy in health management also plays a key role in positively moderating the effect of choice on continued use intention. This study expands information system literature by providing theoretical insights into continued use from the perspective of value-co-creation.

To bridge this research gap, we draw comparisons between disruptive and incremental innovation to account for electric and hybrid vehicles, respectively. We explore the misalignment between technological growth and customer satisfaction by comparing the electric vehicle business model with the hybrid vehicle business model based on three parameters: channels, value propositions, and customer relationships. Primary empirical data are collected from 307 survey participants. Structural equation modeling is then employed to investigate the similarities and differences between electric vehicles based on their disruptive innovation and hybrid vehicles based on their incremental innovation. We find that electric vehicles’ unique focus on channels leads to a positive influence on their business model and customer satisfaction, while focusing on value propositions leads to positive results for hybrid vehicles.

However, not much attention has been paid to the effect of CRM on small or unknown online retailers. As ethical concerns about the Internet continue to rise, consumers' perceptions regarding the ethics of online retailers (CPEOR) become important when making a purchase decision. This research uses the self-signaling theory to examine how online retailers’ information management and promotional strategy (CRM vs. Price Discount) may emit signals and impact on the consumers’ repurchase intention. It was assumed that a high CPEOR would work better with a CRM-based strategy, which is fundamentally aligning in ethics. However, the experimental results surprisingly revealed that when CPEOR was high, the consumers’ repurchase intention increased in the case of a Price Discount-based promotion when compared to a CRM-based promotion; the effect was the opposite when consumers’ CPEOR was low. ANCOVA was used to analyze the data while setting certain variables as covariates.

In particular, greedy algorithms that exploit current estimates without any exploration may be suboptimal in general. However, exploration-free greedy algorithms are desirable in practical settings where exploration may be costly or unethical (e.g., clinical trials). Surprisingly, we find that a simple greedy algorithm can be rate optimal (achieves asymptotically optimal regret) if there is sufficient randomness in the observed contexts (covariates). We prove that this is always the case for a two-armed bandit under a general class of context distributions that satisfy a condition we term covariate diversity. Furthermore, even absent this condition, we show that a greedy algorithm can be rate optimal with positive probability. Thus, standard bandit algorithms may unnecessarily explore. Motivated by these results, we introduce Greedy-First, a new algorithm that uses only observed contexts and rewards to determine whether to follow a greedy algorithm or to explore. We prove that this algorithm is rate optimal without any additional assumptions on the context distribution or the number of arms. Extensive simulations demonstrate that Greedy-First successfully reduces exploration and outperforms existing (exploration-based) contextual bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling or upper confidence bound.

The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day. © 2021 The Author(s)","Clustering; Long-term prediction; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Traffic prediction; Tweet","Highway administration; Social networking (online); Traffic congestion; Baseline methods; Prediction performance; Real time traffics; Social media datum; Spatio-temporal models; Traffic forecasts; Traffic management; Traffic prediction; Forecasting; cluster analysis; motorway; prediction; road traffic; social media; traffic congestion; traffic management; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099205904

Comparison analysis indicates that PTC-BOCR is robust with respect to the variance of 3PLs’ attribute values, while behavioral parameter analysis reveals that the loss-averse behavior of the 4PL is intensified as the difference of 3PLs varies.

The Executive Order on Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth, signed in May 2020, proposes wild-capture fisheries deregulation and prioritization of aquaculture, with an emphasis on offshore development. Recent disruption of wild-caught seafood supply and demand could create space for sustainable aquaculture growth, but expansion could also undermine wild fisheries livelihoods and economics if integrated management between industries is ignored. Here, we review the current state of US seafood and outline five guiding principles around the implementation, and possible modifications, of the Executive Order to facilitate sustainable US fisheries and aquaculture: (1) make precise and strategic fisheries reforms that continue to support sustainable wild fisheries, (2) integrate aquaculture and fisheries using an ecosystem-based approach, (3) improve aquaculture data collection, (4) address social resistance to aquaculture, and (5) reconcile nationalism in a global market.

While there is significant literature on the social and spatial effects of telecommuting, the growth of remote work warrants a holistic analysis of its specific implications for local economic and community life. Drawing on interviews with representatives of 22 firms in one state, this exploratory study examines how locational factors drive firms' remote work utilization. Together with an analysis of interviews with 12 remote employees, it also examines how remote work arrangements are modifying firms' and employees’ connections to the local environment. The firm interviews indicate that remote work is increasingly utilized as a strategy to overcome regional talent acquisition challenges. The analysis reveals that remote work utilization can rework or attenuate the local economic and social linkages of remote-utilizing firms and remote employees. These findings suggest that the dynamics of remote work in local environments entail processes of disembedding and reeembedding, moderated by organizational and contextual factors. By situating questions and findings in relation to local contexts, this study details how firm dynamics and work-life patterns associated with remote work introduce opportunities and challenges for community and economic development efforts. © 2020",,"Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Personnel; Contextual factors; Exploratory studies; Holistic analysis; Local contexts; Local environments; Local perspective; Spatial effect; Technological infrastructure; Economic analysis; economic development; holistic approach; local economy; spatial analysis; technological development; working conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097345730

The demand of a product is assumed to be dependent on the current inventory level. Uncertainties are involved in the demands and yields of the products with their means and standard deviations as the only known information. Using the distributionally robust optimization approach, the problem is formulated as a worst-case expected profit maximization model with a budget constraint. Through mathematical deduction, the developed model is transformed into a tractable convex programming model which can be solved efficiently. The closed-form solution for the order quantity using a Lagrange multiplier is proposed and the corresponding algorithm is presented in the case with one reliable or unreliable supplier. The retailer's ordering decisions are investigated when there are multiple identical or different suppliers, and the effects of yield uncertainties are also assessed. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed models and the solution approaches in dealing with demand and yield uncertainties. Furthermore, the impacts of parameters such as the budget, means and standard deviations of yields and demands, and the correlations between yields on retailer's ordering policies and performance are analyzed. Managerial insights in selecting suppliers are also provided. In particular, a bootstrapping method is used to estimate the means and standard deviations of the demand and yield distributions in a practical application, and the out-of-sample performance of the resulting optimal inventory policy is evaluated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand uncertainty; Distributionally robust optimization; Inventory; Ordering decision; Yield uncertainty","Convex optimization; Lagrange multipliers; Sales; Statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Bootstrapping method; Closed form solutions; Inventory decisions; Inventory policies; Multiple products; Numerical experiments; Robust optimization; Standard deviation; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094319588

Green strategies such as speed reduction, fuel switching, alternative fuels can effectively decrease the harmful emissions from ships and increase environmental sustainability. In the field of green shipping, existing papers focus on using optimization models to calculate the optimal values of green efforts during shipping process. In contrary, this paper adopts a new and alternative perspective by explore the evolutionarily stable strategy for the shipping lines in the green concerning maritime market. First, the pricing decision is formulated as a model by considering the price elasticity, market competition, green investment and the level of green concerning in the market. Then, an evolutionary game theory framework embedded the pricing model is proposed to study the long-term green strategic behavior of maritime shipping lines. In the proposed game framework, each shipping line can choose to adopt a green strategy which is able to reduce the emission during shipping process or a non-green strategy which is cost-effective. A replicator dynamic system is used to examine the evolutionarily stable strategy that will eventually be chosen by the majority of the shipping lines. To illustrate the results, we conduct a simulation experiment and sensitivity analysis. The results demonstrate that the green-concerned shipping lines can gain higher payoff compared to the shipping lines whose goal are payoff maximization under green concerned market. The findings in this paper can provide guidance to maritime shipping lines in formulating their green strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Evolutionarily stable strategy; Evolutionary game theory; Green shipping; One-population game; Pricing decision","Alternative fuels; Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Investments; Sensitivity analysis; Ships; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Evolutionary game theory; Maritime shipping; Market competition; Optimization models; Replicator dynamics; Strategic Behavior; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089741061

Building on recent neuroeconomic evidence that valuations are transformed during the choice process, we incorporate the canonical divisive normalization computation into a discrete choice model and characterize how choice behaviour depends on both size and composition of the choice set. We then examine evidence for such behaviour from two choice experiments that vary the size and composition of the choice set. We find that divisive normalization more accurately captures observed behaviour than alternative models, including an example range normalization model. These results are robust across experimental paradigms. Finally, we demonstrate that Divisive Normalization implements an efficient means for the brain to represent valuations given neurobiological constraints, yielding the fewest choice errors possible given those constraints.

We run a randomized field experiment on a top retailer with 184,375 users split into a recommender-treated group and a control group. We tag theory-driven attributes of 37,125 unique products via Amazon Mechanical Turk to augment the usual product data (e.g., review ratings, descriptions). By examining the recommender’s impact through different stages—awareness (views), salience (conversion|views), and final conversion—and across product types, we provide nuanced insights. The study confirms that the recommender increases views, conversion|views, and final conversion rates by 15.3%, 21.6%, and 7.5%, respectively, but this lift is moderated by product attributes and review ratings. We find that the lift on product views is greater for utilitarian products compared with hedonic products as well as for experience products compared with search products. In contrast, the lift on conversion|views rate is greater for hedonic products compared with utilitarian products. Furthermore, the lift on views rate is greater for products with higher average review ratings, which suggests that a recommender acts as a complement to review ratings, whereas the opposite is true for conversion|views, where recommender and review ratings are substitutes. Additionally, a recommender’s awareness lift is greater than its saliency impact. We discuss the potential mechanisms behind our results as well as their managerial implications.

Public bicycles have also been viewed as one part of a holistic solution to reducing negative transportation externalities. However, government and private entities need a better understanding of factors influencing user adoption of public bicycle systems. In this survey study, 470 prospective public bicycle users from Beijing, China completed face-to-face and web-based surveys, providing their perceptions of public bicycle system attributes, perceived risk associated with public bicycle use, and their intention to switch to public bicycles as a new mode of transportation. Our findings suggest that switching intention is directly influenced by user perceptions of the risk of public bicycle use, as well as user perceptions of the system's relative advantage over other modes of transportation and perceived compatibility of public bicycles with the user's current travel habits. Moreover, perceptions of risk are found to mediate the relationship between system attributes (complexity and observability) and switching intention. That is, user perceptions that public bicycles are difficult to access and use increases perceived risk and reduces the likelihood they will switch to public bicycles as a mode of transportation. Moreover, when prospective users can observe others using the system, their perceptions of risk decrease, which increases the likelihood they will adopt public bicycles as a new mode of transportation.

The method is applied to the British publishing industry. Using text-mining and econometric analysis of secondary data, 258 UK book publishers (93% of the market share) are analysed over a period of 10years (1,508 observations). Firms are categorised as servitized (S-firms), digitized (D-firms), digitized and servitized (DS-firms) and pure (P-firms) that are neither servitized nor digitized (control group). We detect no significant difference in terms of productivity and profitability between P-firms and D-firms. Although we find evidence of a servitization paradox, both S-firms and DS-firms show greater productivity than P-firms.

However, if a new DMU needs to be known its efficiency score, the DEA analysis would have to be re-conducted, especially nowadays, datasets from many fields have been growing rapidly in the real world, which will need a huge amount of computation. Following the previous studies, this paper aims to establish a linkage between the DEA method and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and proposes an alternative way that combines DEA with ML (ML-DEA) algorithms to measure and predict the DEA efficiency of DMUs. Four ML-DEA algorithms are discussed, namely DEA-CCR model combined with back-propagation neural network (BPNN-DEA), with genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with back-propagation neural network (GANN-DEA), with support vector machines (SVM-DEA), and with improved support vector machines (ISVM-DEA), respectively. To illustrate the applicability of above models, the performance of Chinese manufacturing listed companies in 2016 is measured, predicted and compared with the DEA efficiency scores obtained by the DEA-CCR model. The empirical results show that the average accuracy of the predicted efficiency of DMUs is about 94%, and the comprehensive performance order of four ML-DEA algorithms ranked from good to poor is GANN-DEA, BPNN-DEA, ISVM-DEA, and SVM-DEA. © 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Machine learning; Manufacturing companies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100680656

This study addresses two significant criticisms of design thinking, namely, theoretical grounding and construct clarity. It also illustrates how this humanistic and creative design practice transcended into a comprehensive Innovation Management approach, facilitating entrepreneurship and innovation. Our research analyzes the evolution of the design philosophy and practices developed at Stanford University from 1957 to 2005 through document analysis. We identified design qualities that have been consistent over the decades, providing further construct clarity and insights on managing Design-driven Innovation. These design qualities elucidate design thinking as a cognitive process, creative practice, organizational routine, and design culture. They emphasize finding profound needs and problems and translate them into tangible designs, creating value for people. This design philosophy is deeply rooted in humanistic psychology theories, particularly on creativity and human values. Collaborations between psychologists, industrial researchers, and designers created this creative and human-centered design approach, known today as design thinking. This value-driven innovation offers a humanistic perspective on innovation theory and practice. It also offers an Innovation Management schema of design qualities essential for developing Design-driven Innovation capabilities in organizations and educational institutions. We emphasize that developing a creative design culture in which people have the human values, abilities, and confidence to collaboratively identify continuous emerging problems and needs and contribute through tangible designs generates an era of innovation and is essentially innovation management. © 2021 The Authors.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus both on a global aggregate sample and on the differences between high and low income economies. Main findings provide support to the Energy-Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. We find that, the link between economic growth and renewable energy exhibits a U-shaped curve, while that between economic growth and fossil fuel energy consumption, an inverted U-shaped curve. In addition, an increase in renewable energy consumption reduces income inequality. Furthermore, stronger economic growth positively affects electricity production from renewable sources, while it reduces electricity production from coal. Finally, results remain qualitatively similar across different levels of income, and while controlling for potential endogeneity.

In many manufacturing industries, technology selection still represents a challenging and not fully understood area, especially when it comes to choosing between competing technologies with similar levels of performance. The methodology employed identified two competing lamination technologies with high levels of development and mechanization: 1) full lamination/solvent type; and 2) dot lamination/solvent free. This was followed by the identification of multiple factors affecting manufacturing technology selection with respect to the supply chain, the use of analytical hierarchy process techniques, and a case study involving site visits and interviews with the senior management of a company operating in the high-functionality textiles industry. The analysis of empirical data gathered from the case study revealed how supply chain related factors are more important than those directly related to the technical merit of the technology such as low-cost manufacturing or automation. The proposed approach has the potential to be transferable to other industries using lamination processes and/or advanced fiber and fabric technology. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques; high-functionality textile industry; supplier selection; supply chain; technology selection","Access control; Costs; Decision making; Engineering education; Hierarchical systems; Laminating; Machinery; Reinforcement learning; Supply chains; Textiles; Throughput; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Analytical Hierarchy Process; Handover; Supplier selection; Technology selection; Wireless communications; Textile industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069905307

Repurposing options could potentially delay large volumes of material entering unsustainable waste streams such as landfill or incineration and contribute to the circular economy. To plan waste management methods as well as inform the collective team of policy makers, decision makers and local governments, it is essential to understand and assess the geographical variability in the quantity of potential FRP composite blade waste material. Decisions regarding EOL blades are complex due to the varying numbers of blades and diversity in models, therefore it is essential that decommissioning plans are tailored for each location. This research introduces an innovative spatiotemporal approach to investigate the magnitude of the problem and quantify blade waste material associated with the EOL stage of wind turbine blades using the island of Ireland case study. The technical and spatiotemporal variability is assessed through an integrated Geographical Information Science (GIS) framework and online dashboard for decision-making. The findings indicate that for the island of Ireland approximately 53,000 tonnes of composite material will reach the EOL stage by 2040 with highest material densities located in the west and southwest of the island. The integrated GIS approach provides important information on blade type and model to assist decision-making on the design of repurposing strategies for FRP composite blades and provides an exemplar for other countries. © 2021","Circular economy; Composite GFRP waste; End-of-life; GIS; Ireland; Kernel density estimator","Fiber reinforced plastics; Geographic information systems; Human resource management; Turbomachine blades; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wind turbines; Circular economy; Composite GFRP waste; End of lives; Fiber reinforced polymer composites; Geographical information; Ireland; Kernel density estimators; Life stages; Repurposing; Wind turbine blades; Decision making; polymer; biodegradation; composite; GIS; life cycle analysis; recycling; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; waste management; wind farm; wind turbine; Article; environmental decision making; environmental economics; environmental planning; environmental policy; geographic information system; geography; government; Ireland; recycling; spatiotemporal analysis; waste management; wind farm; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104335362

The question is even more important in emerging economies where pollution-intensive industries prevail and policies often favour growth over ecological concerns. This paper explores how four public incentives (regulation, taxes, subsidies and procurement of eco-innovations) and two private incentives (demand incentives and reputational concerns) contribute to the creation of private and social benefits from green (eco) innovations in emerging Central European economies. All six types of incentives have positive effects on the introduction of environmental innovations. Firms introduce innovations with benefits for end users only if they are accompanied by private benefits.

Based on panel data from Chinese provinces, spanning the period 1998–2016, this study explores the impact of long- and short-term corruption on per capita carbon emissions by considering the heterogeneous distribution of those emissions. The results document that corruption increases per capita carbon emissions in Chinese provinces in the short run, reducing per capita carbon emissions in the long run. Moreover, an increase in corruption leads to an increase in carbon emissions per capita in all quantiles, indicating that these emissions increase with corruption severity. The coefficients in low quantiles are slightly larger than those in high quantiles, indicating that corruption leads to more carbon emissions in provinces with lower per capita carbon emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Chinese provinces; Corruption; Panel ARDL model; Panel quantile regression model","Crime; Regression analysis; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Carbon emissions; Chinese province; Empirical examination; Model approach; Panel ARDL model; Panel data; Panel quantile regression model; Per capita; Quantile regression; Carbon; carbon emission; corruption; heterogeneity; numerical model; panel data; regression analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103136843

Many opportunities to recycle, down-cycle or up-cycle products have also been identified for enabling greater circularity. However, to obtain a Sustainable Circular Economy (SCE) there is a need to holistically assess and design entire value chains of the product while considering various alternatives that may be available at each stage of its circular network. Systematic methods are also needed to determine the environmental, economic, and social implications of various value chain pathways and quantify their trade-offs with circularity from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. We propose a systematic and rigorous computational framework to analyze existing circular systems and develop new designs. This framework combines the computational approach of life cycle assessment with optimization-based approaches for process synthesis and network representation. Life-cycle networks are modified to contain multiple alternatives along the value chain and permit circular flows between modules. Four basic types of nodes are identified such that any SCE network may be represented as their combination. The additional degrees of freedom generated in such a superstructure network are determined by using principles of allocation and displacement, material-energy balances and physico-chemical governing equations of modules, thereby permitting integration of fundamental models with data-based LCA methods. Typical cases that may arise in potential circular value chains are formulated and solved to highlight the wide applicability of the framework. Both analysis and synthesis methods are proposed to evaluate candidate pathways within the superstructure network. Application of this framework to illustrative examples highlights its use for systematic design of circular value chains to meet SCE goals by quantifying the trade-offs between objectives. Such a framework is needed to develop general software to study the scope of innovation at different stages of the value chain, and contribute toward optimal closing of the cycles of different materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Life-cycle analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Process synthesis; Sustainable design","Commerce; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Product design; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Circular networks; Computational framework; Environmental implications; Lifecycle analysis; Multi-objectives optimization; Process synthesis; Systematic method; Trade off; Value chains; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102297500

Cost innovation does not always lead to a new product, rather it is a way to reduce operational costs through the value creation activities of a business model to achieve resource-constrained innovation. Good-enough innovations are developed through existing platform reengineering and localization through value creation activities. We demonstrate that frugal innovations are developed based on new product architectures and applications that can create completely new market segments to compete against non-consumption. Reverse innovations refer to frugal innovations that are characterized by higher market novelty because they create completely new market segments in developed and developing markets for value capture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Business model; Case study; India; Resource-constrained innovation","Education; Business modeling; Developing markets; Emerging markets; Frugal innovations; Managing resources; Multiple-case study; Product architecture; Reverse innovations; Commerce; business development; innovation; numerical model; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101770117

We consider the quasi maximum likelihood (QML) method to estimate our proposed model. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the QML estimator, including the consistency, the asymptotic representation, and the limiting distribution. We also propose new statistics to test the validity of the use of traditional dynamic and static panel data estimation methods.

In most cases, circular design and product life-extension practices specify repair as an essential element. In both the EU and the U.S., policymakers are attempting to increase the amount of repairs made, through the introduction of recent EU Ecodesign regulation changes and proposed US Right to Repair legislation. This review explores the current policy landscape for repair services by first outlining legal and market barriers to stakeholder participation in repair activities, and which stakeholders are affected. The review reveals a wide range of fundamental obstacles to both supply and demand of repair, including Intellectual Property, Consumer, Contract, Tax and Chemical laws, along with issues of design, consumer perceptions and markets. Subsequently, the current and proposed policy solutions to address barriers and increase repair activities are reviewed. A comparative assessment of the EU and the U.S. is followed by a discussion on the current repair market governance structure, which is found to be primarily centralized (i.e. repair services concentrated with manufacturers), with possible implications for upscaling repair. New policy proposals challenge this governance. Introducing the concept of a Repair Society Framework as a market transformation tool, we comprehensively discuss the current state of repair and provide an outlook for research and policy in this area. © 2020 The Authors","Circular economy; Ecodesign; Electrical and electronic equipment; Market governance; Repair; Repair society","Economic and social effects; Product design; Comparative assessment; Consumer perception; Essential elements; Governance structures; Market transformation; Product life extension; Stakeholder participation; Supply and demand; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098473469

However, it remains challenging for the operators to charge the fleet because of limited or costly access to charging facilities. In this paper, we focus on answering the core question how to charge the fleet to make EV sharing viable and profitable. Academic/practical relevance: Our work is motivated by the setback that struck San Diego, California, where car rental company car2go ceased its EV-sharing operations. We integrate charging infrastructure planning and vehicle repositioning operations that were often considered separately. More interestingly, our modeling emphasizes the operator-controlled charging operations and customers' EV-picking behavior, which are both central to EV sharing but were largely overlooked. Methodology: Supported by the real data of car2go, we develop a queuing network model that characterizes how customers endogenously pick EVs based on energy levels and how the operator implements a charging-up-To policy. The integrated queuing-location model leads to a nonlinear optimization program. We then propose both lower and upper bound formulations as mixed-integer second-order cone programs, which are computationally tractable and result in a small optimality gap when the fleet size is adequate. Results: We learn lessons from the setback of car2go in San Diego. We find that the viability of EV sharing can be enhanced by concentrating limited charger resources at selected locations. Charging EVs either in a proactive fashion or at the 40% recharge threshold (rather than car2go's policy of charging EVs only when their energy level drops below 20%) can boost the profit by more than 15%. Moreover, sufficient charger availability is crucial when collaborating with a public charger network. Increasing the charging power relieves the charger resource constraint, whereas extending per-charge range or adopting unmanned repositioning improves profitability. Finally, we discuss how EV sharing operations depend on the urban spatial structure, compared with conventional car sharing. Managerial implications: We demonstrate a data-verified and high-granularity modeling approach. Both the high-level planning guidelines and operational policies can be useful for practitioners. We also highlight the value of jointly managing demand fulfillment and EV charging. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Previous work has considered the question of trust through the lens of model validation. However, whilst a simulation model may be technically well executed, stakeholders’ trust in the results may also depend upon intangible factors such as interpersonal relationships. Existing literature has also focused on the credibility of the simulation practitioner, however the credibility attribute belongs to the stakeholder, and it ignores the trust aspects that may exist between the stakeholders and the model itself. In this paper, we argue that different facets of trust emerge throughout the stages of a simulation study, and both influence, and are influenced by, the interaction between the model, the modeller and the stakeholders of the study. We present a synthesis of existing literature and extend it by proposing a formative model of trust which presents a conceptualisation of this tripartite relationship. Our contribution is the identification of the different facets of trust in the lifecycle of a modelling and simulation study. We argue that these interacting facets converge via the three-way relationship between modeller, model and stakeholders toward epistemic trust in the knowledge generated by the simulation study and ultimately model acceptability and implementation. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study that focuses solely on the question of trust in an M&S study. © 2020 The Author(s)","Decision processes; Facilitated modelling; OR practice; Participatory modelling; Trust","Life cycle; Intangible factors; Interpersonal relationship; Model validation; Modelling and simulations; Modelling process; Real world operations; Simulation studies; Through the lens; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088784990

A large amount of user-generated content on social media can be captured and analysed to help organisations gain insights into market requirements and enhance business intelligence. Accordingly, this study proposes an analytic framework for retail pharmacy organisations to: a) use social media and highlight the most-discussed topics by consumers, b) to identify the key areas for improvement based on the most negative comments received, and c) to determine the connections amongst the important concepts and enhance customer loyalty by adding values to consumers. We conduct an in-depth analysis on the Twitter platforms of the three largest retail pharmacy organisations in the UK: Boots, Lloyds and Superdrug. The findings show that issues with marketing, customer service and product are the key improvement areas for the retail pharmacies. Particularly, Boots received an overall better sentiment performance than Lloyds and Superdrug. We also determine the relationships amongst the important concepts discussed by consumers. The analysis generates insights into the use of social media for supporting pharmacy organisations in developing their social media strategies as well as improving their operations and service quality. © 2020","Retail pharmacy industry; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Text mining; Twitter data","Commerce; Quality control; Sales; Service industry; Customer loyalty; Customer services; In-depth analysis; Market requirements; New business models; Operational excellence; Service management; User-generated content; Social networking (online); consumption behavior; digitization; information and communication technology; pharmaceutical industry; retailing; service quality; service sector; social media; strategic approach; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097783018

The LBSN-based recommendation algorithms usually consider three factors: user similarity, social influence between friends and geographical influence in. The LBSN-based recommendation system first needs to collect relevant information of users and then provide them with potentially interesting contents. However, sensitive information of users may be leaked when the recommendation is provided. In this article, we focus on preventing user's privacy from disclosure upon geographical location and friend relationship factors. We propose a geographical location privacy-preserving algorithm (GLP) that achieves 〈r,h〉-privacy and present a friend relationship privacy-preserving algorithm (FRP) through adding Laplacian distributed noise for fusing the user trusts. Subsequently, we integrate the GLP and FRP algorithms into a general recommendation system and build a privacy-preserving recommendation system. The novel system enjoys the privacy guarantee under the metric differential entropy through theoretical analysis.

This review analyzes and addresses gaps in modeling supply chain resilience in general and specifically for vaccines in order to guide researchers and practitioners alike to improve critical function of vaccine supply chains in the face of inevitable disruptions. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic review of the literature on modeling supply chain resilience from 2007 to 2020 is analyzed in tandem with the vaccine supply chain manufacturing literature. These trends are then used to apply a novel matrix analysis to seven Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annual filings of pharmaceutical corporations involved in COVID-19 vaccine manufacture and distribution. Findings: Pharmaceutical corporations favor efficiency as they navigate regulatory, economic and other threats to their vaccine supply chains, neglecting resilience – absorption, adaptation and recovery from inevitable and unexpected disruptions. However, explicitly applying resilience analytics to the vaccine supply chain and further leveraging emerging network science tools found in the academic literature, such as artificial intelligence (AI), stress tests and digital twins, will help supply chain managers to better quantify efficiency/resilience tradeoffs across all associated networks/domains and support optimal system performance post disruption. Originality/value: This is the first review addressing resilience analytics in vaccine supply chains and subsequent extension to operational management through novel matrix analyses of SEC Filings. The authors provide analyses and recommendations that facilitate resilience quantification capabilities for vaccine supply chain managers, regulatory agencies and corporate stakeholders and are especially relevant for pandemic response, including application to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID; Network science; Policy; Resilience; Supply chain; Vaccine","Computer system recovery; Efficiency; Managers; Manufacture; Vaccines; COVID; Critical functions; Design/methodology/approach; Matrix analysis; Modeling approach; Network science; Resilience; Securities and Exchange Commissions; Supply chain resiliences; Vaccine supplies; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105985701

The proposed hypotheses related to the indirect effects are based on the resource-based view of the firm. The conditional indirect effects for four organisational factors are tested. The research framework is operationalised based on data from 236 practitioners. The findings show that blockchain is perceived to drive improvement in six supply chain dimensions of the manufacturing industry. The breadth of organisation size and geographical dispersion moderate the mediation relationship between blockchain benefits and incremental profitability. Furthermore, the conditional indirect effects are found significant at mean and ±1σ values of integration intensity and IT integration. According to managers of manufacturing industry, blockchain can bring significant improvement in delivery reliability and mass customisation, which would result in increasing the profitability of the organisation. Organisations with low integration intensity, high IT integration and small size organisations are likely to be the early adopters of blockchain technology. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Blockchain technology; conditional indirect effects; manufacturing industry; moderated mediation; structural equation modeling; supply chain management","Digital storage; Integration; Manufacture; Profitability; Supply chains; Delivery reliability; Disruptive technology; Geographical dispersions; Integration intensity; Manufacturing industries; Organisational factors; Research frameworks; Resource-based view of the firm; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100985570

In order to design a resilient supply chain network capable of responding to such potential risks suitably, this paper proposes a novel framework for the business continuity-inspired resilient supply chain network design (BCRSCND) problem, which includes three steps. First, four resilience dimensions including Anticipation, Preparation, Robustness, and Recovery are considered to quantify the resilience score of each facility using a multi-criteria decision-making technique and considering a comprehensive set of resilience strategies. In the second step, the critical processes and their business continuity metrics (which are vital for supply chain continuity), are identified. The outputs of the first two steps provide the inputs of a novel two-stage mixed possibilistic-stochastic programing (TSMPSP) model. The model aims to design a multi-echelon, multi-product resilient supply chain network under both operational and disruption risks. The proposed TSMPSP model allows decision makers to incorporate their risk attitudes into the design process. After converting the original TSMPSP model into the crisp counterpart, several sensitivity analyses are conducted on different features of hypothetical disruptions (i.e. their severity, likelihood and location) and DM’s risk attitudes from which useful managerial insights are provided. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business continuity management; possibilistic programming; Resilience management; supply chain design; two-stage stochastic programming","Decision making; Product design; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Business continuity; Decision makers; Multi-criteria decision making technique; Multi-products; Potential risks; Resilience strategy; Supply chain network; Supply chain network design; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096561733

We compare three capacity allocation policies in the presence of supply disruption, with both full and partial disruption cases investigated. The results show that the two-stage policy outperforms other capacity allocation policies when a disruption is anticipated and that partial disruption is more manageable than full disruption in terms of meeting the SLAs. Furthermore, the supplier is better off to negotiate a longer performance review period assuming the penalty per time unit is fixed. This result is contrary to findings in the literature for SLAs when there is no consideration of disruption.

Factor analysis of the data extracted nine social and economic factors, which were then analysed using stepwise regression analysis. The findings indicate that the diversification of Iran's farms into tourism businesses would introduce a new social and economic growth stimulus for local communities. The stepwise regression findings were employed to identify which farm tourism factors are required for socioeconomic development in Iran. Factors were divided into nine categories of socioeconomic development: learning and educational activities improvements, cultural development, community participation, thriving local economy, pursuit of personal values, income generation, quality of life improvement, building business competitiveness and modifying migration structure.

With increasing demand for EVs, the industry is facing many challenges for sustainable supply chain of electric vehicle batteries. The lithium-ion battery is a major component of electric vehicles. Many challenges for sustainability of electric vehicle battery supply chains have been extracted through literature review and discussions with industry experts. These challenges may be categorized as operational, technological, economic, environmental and social. Delphi technique is utilized to finalize major challenges for analysis. For further prioritization of these challenges, Best-Worst Method (BWM) is used. Finally, findings of the BWM are validated through an empirical study by collecting responses from 87 respondents. It is observed that ineffective recycling and reuse of batteries, disposal of batteries, and insufficient charging infrastructure are the three most important challenges in EV battery supply chain in India. The findings may be equally relevant in many developing countries having similar technological and infrastructure constraints. It will help policymakers in developing strategies for sustainable transport systems in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Best-Worst Method; Circular economy; Delphi study; Electric vehicles; Li-ion batteries; Recycling; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Developing countries; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Proven reserves; Recycling; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; BAD methods; Battery supply; Best-bad method; Circular economy; DELPHI study; Electric vehicle batteries; Excel; Hybrid approach; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable transport; Lithium-ion batteries; fossil fuel; lithium ion; developing world; economics; electric vehicle; recycling; supply chain management; sustainability; transportation system; analytic method; Article; Best Worst Method; China; Delphi study; developing country; economic aspect; environmental factor; India; recycling; social aspect; sustainable supply chain; traffic and transport; China; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114181665

Through a number of numerical experiments, we show the impact of the diversified customer demand and the novel distribution network features on the overall network performance and demonstrate the economic benefit of an integrated approach.

This research applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to achieve a detailed understanding of the issue. The findings reveal that Integrated Social Media Interaction (ISMI) depends on Customer-Centric Focus (CCF), Customer Engagement Focus (CEF), and Customer Empathy Focus (CEmF). Based on the literature and our analytical research, it is revealed that the use of social media networks as a source of knowledge for NPD ventures is a systematic component of the NPD process for SMEs during the COVOD-19 pandemic.

Unsatisfied demand is lost and unobserved, and the only available information for decision making is the observed sales data (also known as censored demand). Conventional approaches, such as stochastic approximation, online convex optimization, and continuum-armed bandit algorithms, cannot be employed, because neither the realized values of the profit function nor its derivatives are known. A major challenge of this problem lies in that the estimated profit function constructed from observed sales data is multimodal in price. We develop a nonparametric spline approximation–based learning algorithm. The algorithm separates the planning horizon into a disjoint exploration phase and an exploitation phase. During the exploration phase, a spline approximation of the demand-price function is constructed based on sales data, and then the corresponding surrogate optimization problem is solved on a sparse grid to obtain a pair of recommended price and target inventory level. During the exploitation phase, the algorithm implements the recommended strategies. We establish a (nearly) square-root regret rate, which (almost) matches the theoretical lower bound.

Airlines are operating with two types of air crew: cockpit crew and cabin crew. Due to the unique operating characteristics, the scheduling problems for these two crew types are very different. Besides, according to the planning stage, the airline crew scheduling problem can be classified as tactical planning problems (traditional scheduling and robust scheduling, weeks or months before the actual operations) and operational planning problems (recovery, after disruptions have occurred during the operational stage). Realizing the significance of the airline crew scheduling problems and a lack of review on the modelling and algorithmic advancements in terms of each crew type and planning stage, we develop this paper to review the related literature from four aspects: the scheduling for cabin crew, the scheduling for both cabin crew and cockpit crew, the robust scheduling for cockpit crew, and the recovery for cockpit crew.

The extant evidence points to increasing territorial disparities in Europe concerning innovation. Relying on production theory, we examine the nature of these disparities. In particular, we are interested in finding out whether catching up processes are stronger than the shifts of the technology frontier, which would lead to a convergence of national innovation systems, or if, on the contrary, technological change is sounder than catching up, leading to increasing divergence in the performance of innovation systems. To capture these underlying dynamics, we apply the global Malmquist productivity index to the data included in the 2019 edition of the European Innovation Scoreboard, which includes statistical information for the period 2011–2018. The evolution shown by the global Malmquist productivity over time demonstrates that productivity gains as a result of innovation are falling. Our results evidence that innovation activities do not necessarily imply technological improvements. Furthermore, innovation activities do not prompt follower and lagging countries to catch up with more advanced ones.

However, the social dimension has been neglected and it can cause an irreparable outcome in the biotechnology industries. Following this issue, this study propounds a modified systemic approach for a social sustainability impact assessment of the treatment technologies for converting waste into bioenergy, based on a review on the common social assessment methods. As it is known, the guideline presented by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (2009) due to considering social life cycle assessment has a comprehensive look at the stakeholders. Therefore, in this paper, UNEP method was selected. However, it needs to be modified based on the bio-energy supply chain derived from municipal solid waste. For this purpose, the bioenergy value chain derived from municipal solid waste was designed and combined with UNEP guideline, to complete the level of stakeholder subgroups and the levels of the indicators. The final method of the social assessment system was presented to the board of experts and finalized. In order to design the measurement part of the social assessment system, because of a multi criteria decision making nature of the social sustainability evaluation of the conversion technologies of municipal solid waste to bio-energies, a recent developed multi-criteria decision making method so-called Best Worst Method (BWM) was used in two stages. The criteria are ranked according to their average weight obtained through Best Worst method. One of the major novelties in this research is the way of application of the best worst technique in the second stage. The model was implemented in the case of Tehran as one of the pioneering Iranian municipalities with high potential to produce bioenergy.

Although entrepreneurial orientation holds the key for entrepreneurial success, research on how entrepreneurial orientation impacts the relationship between grassroots innovation (GRI) and entrepreneurial success is critical. This research is still in its infancy and has not adequately been addressed. This study endeavors to fill this gap while examining how the three factors of grassroots innovation such as new grassroots learning practices, local solution and networking capabilities influence entrepreneurial orientation enroute to affecting economic benefits and non-economic benefits from entrepreneurial activity. The study involved data from 400 grassroots innovators and a structural equation modeling approach was used to fit the data based on the aforementioned factors and components. The study reveals that entrepreneurial orientation is observed to fully mediate the relationship between the following three linear dependencies: new grassroots learning practices and economic benefits, networking capabilities and economic benefits, and local solution and non-economic benefits. This study also found that entrepreneurial orientation partially mediates the relationship in the following cases: new grassroots learning practices and non-economic benefits, networking capabilities and non-economic benefits, and local solution and economic benefits. The results provide empirical evidence to support that entrepreneurial orientation spurred by grassroots innovation significantly influence entrepreneurial success in the Indian context. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Entrepreneurial orientation; Entrepreneurial success; Grassroots innovation; Structural equation model","Economic analysis; Economic benefits; En-route; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurial orientation; Entrepreneurial success; Linear dependency; Structural equation modeling; Economic and social effects; economic impact; entrepreneur; equation; innovation; learning; networking; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063371685

Considering food industry's operations and processes, this study identifies 25 challenges to the FS initiatives involving the opinions of practitioners from six major Indian food producers and academic experts. The challenges are grouped into five categories, viz. organisational, government and policy, global, knowledge and financial. We identify the best and worst challenges to the FS initiatives along with causality among them using combined Best Worst Method (BWM) and ‘Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory’ (DEMATEL) approaches. BWM prioritises these challenges, while DEMATEL identifies causal relationship maps for the prioritised challenges. The BWM results demonstrate that the government and policy related challenges are the key challenges followed by the organisational, global, knowledge and financial related challenges. The DEMATEL results exhibit the organisational, government and policy, and global related challenges as the cause group challenges. The knowledge and financial related challenges represent the effect group challenges. Mitigation of these challenges inherently necessitates stakeholders’ involvement in the food supply chains. We identify constructs for food safety initiatives policy in the emerging economies to raise public awareness while encouraging greater collaboration and efficiency in food supply chains to help achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for securing food for everyone. The results of the study offer guidance and deeper insights to supply chain managers about synergy requirements between the government policymakers and key players of the industry in the emerging economies. © 2020","Best worst method; DEMATEL; Emerging economy; Food safety; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Decision making; Finance; Food safety; Food supply; Supply chains; Causal relationships; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratories; Emerging economies; Food industries; Food producers; Organisational; Policy makers; Public awareness; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096878924

Despite striking volatility, their high average returns and low correlations have established CCs as alternative investment assets for portfolio and risk management. We investigate the benefits of adding CCs to well-diversified portfolios of conventional financial assets for different types of investors, including risk-averse, return-maximizing and diversification-seeking investors who may trade at different frequencies, namely, daily, weekly or monthly. We calculate out-of-sample performance and diversification benefits for the most popular portfolio-construction rules, including mean-variance optimization, risk-parity, and maximum-diversification strategies, as well as combined strategies. Our results demonstrate that CCs can improve the risk-return profile of portfolios, but their benefit depends on investor objectives. In particular, diversification strategies (maximizing the portfolio diversification index or equating risk contributions) draw appreciably on CCs and show, in line with spanning tests, CCs to be non-redundant extensions of the investment universe. However, when we introduce liquidity constraints via the LIBRO method to account for illiquidity of many CCs, out-of-sample performance drops considerably, while the diversification benefits persist. We conclude that the utility of CC investments strongly depends on investor characteristics. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Altcoins; Asset classes; Bitcoin; Blockchain; CRIX; Cryptocurrency; DLT; Investments; Portfolio management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104183402

To improve the efficiency of value chain activities such as manufacturing, distribution, and consumption, an innovative research solution has been proposed: ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) through Information and Communication Technology (ICT)’. Sustainability through ICT is significant for the industry in terms of its sustainable effects on production processes, environment, and community. This research seeks to gauge ICT—as knowledge management—for industries in the successful adoption and execution of SCP. In so doing, potential key ICT-based factors to SCP are identified from the literature and experts’ feedback. The present work suggests a decision framework for assessing the interrelationships among and between the ICT oriented factors by utilizing graph theory and matrix approach. Data for this work derives from three automotive companies operating in India. From findings, ‘Governance and Management’, is the topmost factor for the adoption of sustainable consumption and production in value chains. The relationship among the index values is further evaluated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. This research can facilitate practitioners, government agencies, and customers for a better understanding of ICT-driven factors in managing resources, reducing waste, and improving cost, which would further help in meeting sustainable development goals of the United Nations of responsible consumption and production and innovation, industry, and infrastructure. © 2021 IGI Global.

Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are a common ecosystem-level response to such pollution that is detrimental to both aquatic life and human health and that generates economic losses (e.g., property values and lost tourism). Waste treatment and management technologies are not well established practices due, in part, to the difficulty to attribute economic value to associated social and environmental impacts of nutrient pollution. In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify the economic impacts of HABs. We demonstrate the advantage of quantifying these impacts through a case study on livestock waste management in the Upper Yahara watershed region (in the state of Wisconsin, USA). Our analysis reveals that every excess kilogram of phosphorus runoff from livestock waste results in total economic losses of 74.5 USD.

As an example, a risk matrix was used to rank risk of events that could lead to a leak in a storage tank and to make decisions on risks to be allowed based on past statistical data. An intelligent system that recognizes increasing level(s) and draws awareness to the possibility of additional increase before unsafe levels are attained was used to analyse and make critical decisions.

In contrast to prior studies that predict dramatic employment declines, we find that investments in robotics are associated with increases in total firm employment but decreases in the total number of managers. Similarly, we find that robots are associated with an increase in the span of control for supervisors remaining within the organization. We also provide evidence that robot adoption is not motivated by the desire to reduce labor costs but is instead related to improving product and service quality. Our findings are consistent with the notion that robots reduce variance in production processes, diminishing the need for managers to monitor worker activities to ensure production quality. As additional evidence, we also find that robot investments predict improved performance measurement and increased adoption of incentive pay based on individual employee performance. With respect to changes in skill composition within the organization, robots predict decreases in employment for middle-skilled workers but increases in employment for low- and high-skilled workers. We also find that robots predict not only changes in employment but also corresponding adaptations in organizational structure. Robot investments are associated with both centralization and decentralization of decision-making authority depending on the task, but decision rights in either case are reassigned away from the managerial level of the hierarchy. Overall, our results suggest that robots have distinct and profound effects on employment and organizations that require fundamental changes in firm practices and organizational design. © 2021 INFORMS.","AI; Automation; Decentralization; Employment; Human capital; Incentives; Managers; Organizational change; Organizational design; Robots; Skill-biased technical change","Decision making; Employment; Forecasting; Human resource management; Investments; Machine design; Managers; Wages; Centralization and decentralizations; Employee performance; Fundamental changes; General purpose technologies; Organizational designs; Organizational structures; Performance measurements; Product and services; Robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114475952

However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (“deployment effect”). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (“disclosure effect”). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies. Managerial abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are bound to transform how companies manage employees. We examine the use of AI to generate performance feedback for employees. We demonstrate that AI significantly increases the accuracy and consistency of the analyses of information collected, and the relevance of feedback to each employee. These advantages of AI help employees achieve greater job performance at scale, and thus create value for companies. However, our study also alerts companies to the negative effect of disclosing using AI to employee that results from employees' negative perceptions about the deployment of AI, which offsets the business value created by AI. To alleviate value-destroying disclosure effect, we suggest that companies be more proactive in communicating with their employees about the objectives, benefits, and scope of AI applications in order to assuage their concerns. Moreover, the result of the allayed negative AI disclosure effect among employees with a longer tenure in the company suggests that companies may consider deploying AI in a tiered instead of a uniform fashion, that is, using AI to provide performance feedback to veteran employees but using human managers to provide performance feedback to novices. © 2021 The Authors.

The main contribution of the study is to propose a framework by making ideal matching and ranking of big data solutions to barriers to circularity in dairy supply chains. This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions. The results indicate that among the main barriers, ‘economic’ was of the highest importance, followed by ‘technological’, ‘environmental’, ‘strategic’, ‘supply chain management’ then ‘social and legal barrier’ in dairy supply chains. In order to overcome circularity focused barriers, ‘optimization’ is determined to be the most important big data solution. The other solutions to overcoming proposed challenges are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’, ‘statistical techniques’ and ‘artificial neural network’ respectively. The suggested big data solutions will be useful for policy makers and managers to deal with potential barriers in implementing circularity in the context of dairy supply chains. © 2021","Barriers; Big data solution; Circular economy; Dairy supply chain; Fuzzy ANP - VIKOR; Group decision making system","Big data; Data mining; Environmental regulations; Information management; Neural networks; Statistical methods; Supply chain management; Barrier; Big data solution; Circular economy; Dairy supply chain; Data driven; Data solutions; Decision framework; Fuzzy ANP - VIKOR; Group decision making system; Potential barriers; Decision making; analytical hierarchy process; dairy farming; data mining; fuzzy mathematics; multicriteria analysis; optimization; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107638033

For this purpose, the long- and short-run relationships between IEWP and per capita GDP as the indicator of economic growth, energy consumption per capita, and the population were analyzed. In addition, the well-known Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology framework was used. The empirical model was evaluated by applying the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. The ARDL bounds test was employed to investigate the long-run relationships. The results indicated the existence of a long-run relationship and cointegration. The empirical results also revealed that the relationship between economic growth and IEWP is positive and statistically significant. This indicated that Iran is located in the first stage of development. According to the empirical results, energy consumption has reduced IEWP. Therefore, the energy consumption in Iran is ecologically inefficient in improving human well-being in the short and long run. Moreover, the impact of the population is negative on IEWP and statistically significant in the short and long run. As a result, the population growth in Iran contributes to more environmental degradation and pollution. Hence, energy consumption and population development policies must align with the reduction in environmental pollution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","ARDL; Economic growth; Energy consumption; IEWP; STIRPAT","cointegration analysis; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; pollution control; population growth; spatiotemporal analysis; Iran; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099760996

We consider inventory decisions at the start of the selling horizon for a seasonal product, with online fulfillment decisions made multiple times over the horizon. To address the intractability in considering inventory and fulfillment decisions together, we relax the problem using a hindsight-optimal bound, for which the inventory decision can be made independent of the optimal fulfillment decisions, while still incorporating virtual pooling of online demands across locations. We develop a computationally fast and scalable inventory heuristic for the multilocation problem based on the two-store analysis. The inventory heuristic directly informs dynamic fulfillment decisions that guide online demand fulfillment from stores. Using a numerical study based on a fictitious network embedded in the United States, we show that our heuristic significantly outperforms traditional strategies. The value of centralized inventory planning is highest when there is a moderate mix of online and in-store demands leading to synergies between pooling within and across locations, and this value increases with the size of the network. The inventory-aware fulfillment heuristic considerably outperforms myopic policies seen in practice, and is found to be near-optimal under a wide range of problem parameters. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","asymptotic analysis; e-commerce; fulfillment; heuristic; inventory management; omnichannel","Location; Sales; Virtual addresses; Demand fulfillments; Inventory decisions; Inventory planning; Optimal bounds; Over the horizons; Physical stores; Problem parameters; Seasonal product; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097961527

The technological and distributed network nature of blockchain technology requires evaluation by decision makers from various levels of a supply chain network. These decision makers will likely have varying blockchain technology knowledge and subjective preferences that need integration. The proposed method helps to operationalize social network relationships to comprehend partial and idiosyncratic expert opinions about blockchain technology.

Due to the role of resource utilization as a key component of logistics network design, another primary goal of design is ensuring available scarce resources are used as efficiently as possible across all facilities. To address efficiency issues in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network, a stochastic integrated multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed in this paper, in which sustainability outcomes as well as efficiency of facility resource utilization are considered in the design of a sustainable supply chain network. In doing so, efficiency is assessed using a bi-objective output-oriented data envelopment analysis model. A hybrid three-step solution methodology is presented that creates a linear form of the original mixed integer nonlinear programming problem using piecewise McCormick envelopes approach. In the second step, an aggregated single objective programming model is derived by exploiting the multi-choice goal programming. Finally, a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to effectively solve the latter stochastic single objective mixed integer linear programming problem. The application of the proposed approach is investigated with data drawn from a case study in the electronics industry. This case study illustrates how firms may balance sustainability and efficiency in the supply chain network design problem. Further, it demonstrates the integration of efficiency results in improving economic aspects of sustainability as well as social responsibility outcomes, but also highlights the trade-offs that exist between efficiency and environmental impacts. © 2021","Closed-loop supply chain network; Data envelopment analysis; Lagrangian relaxation; Multi-choice goal programming; Stochastic programming; Sustainability","Data envelopment analysis; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Integer programming; Lagrange multipliers; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Case-studies; Closed-loop supply chain network designs; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Data envelopment; Lagrangian relaxations; Multi-choice goal programming; Resources utilizations; Stochastic formulation; Stochastics; Supply chain network; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105890099

Unlike traditional consumption, collaborative consumption is based on collaboration among individuals, so that the decision-making mechanisms of individual consumers may be different from those in traditional consumption scenarios. The current study focuses on how the social distance between consumers and drivers affects collaborative consumption intention in the case of online car-hailing services. In this study, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) is used as the foundational framework, and we innovatively add the concept of social distance to the TPB to form a new, and integrated model. We test the model based on data collected from 315 online car-hailing users. The results shows that behavioral attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, positively influence collaborative consumption intention and behavior. More interestingly, we find that social distance has both direct and indirect impacts on collaborative consumption intention: The greater the social distance, the lower the collaborative consumption intention. Moreover, social distance also moderates the influence of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on collaborative consumption intention. To be specific, the influence of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on collaborative consumption intention is weakened when consumers perceive less social distance. The results suggest that the integrated model has a stronger explanatory power on collaborative consumption behavior. This study enhances the traditional TPB model and offers insight into promoting collaborative consumption in the context of the sharing economy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative consumption; Online car-hailing; Social distance; Theory of planned behavior","car use; consumption behavior; decision making; mobile communication; perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102835263

This study explores how different dimensions of a supplier's sustainability can affect managers' evaluation and consequent selection of a supplier. An experimental research method is applied to examine a series of hypotheses that integrate the sustainable supply chain management literature and the behavioural decision-making literature. Data from a total of 857 valid sets of responses in three scenario-based experiments were used to explore the impacts of long-term and short-term relationships with the supplier, and the length of work experience of the supply chain manager as factors in managers' selection decisions. The findings show that managers favour sustainability dimensions in their evaluation and intention to select a supplier. Moreover, managers react more negatively to a low level of sustainability than they react positively to a high level of sustainability. The economic dimension of sustainability has the strongest impact of the three dimensions on managers' supplier evaluation and selection intent. Furthermore, where the manager and supplier have been in a long-term relationship, there is an interaction effect between managers support for each of the dimensions and the effect of sustainability on supplier evaluation and selection. However, this moderating effect is less significant in a short-term relationship and becomes insignificant after accounting for the impact of length of work experience of the decision-makers. The experimental research approach and results provide managerial implications for effective allocation of resources, as well as policy suggestions for the broader operations and supply chain systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behaviour decision-making; Experiment; Supplier selection; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Managers; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Behavior decision-making; Behavioural studies; Chain management; Experimental research; Short term; Supplier evaluation and selections; Supplier selection; Sustainability impacts; Term relationship; Work experience; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103690243

Collecting data from an online survey conducted in Hong Kong, we test the hypotheses using partial least squares structural equation modeling.

It was shown that descriptive social norms played an important role in shaping user's attitudes toward orderly parking directly and indirectly via personal norms, and thus influence the behavioral intention of orderly parking. Cultural tightness-looseness further moderated the effect of descriptive social norms. At the individual level, antecedents of personal norms (moral awareness, awareness of consequences, and ascription of responsibility) were investigated based on Norm Activation Model.

However, the burgeoning popularity of online games in some cases leads to addiction, a phenomenon that has received considerable attention. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of psychological ownership, gaming motivation, and primary–secondary control on online game addiction (OGA). Based on 436 valid responses collected from online questionnaires, the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was employed to test the research model. Findings show that the motivations of achievement and escapism are positively associated with psychological ownership toward a virtual gaming environment. Of particular interest is the inverted-U relationship between psychological ownership and OGA, suggesting that too little or too much psychological ownership is associated with less OGA. Finally, individuals with high levels of primary (secondary) control are more (less) inclined to be addicted to online games. This study provides practical implications and strategies to address the alarming increase in OGA. First, families, communities, and universities should encourage outdoor activities, such as sports competitions, and offline cosplay games to address the need for achievement and escapism. Second, individuals who play online games for relaxation should choose a relatively easy or hard mode to avoid game addiction. Finally, parents, teachers, and employers are encouraged to pay attention to individuals who have a high level of primary control since they can be susceptible to OGA. This study provides several theoretical contributions. First, the study enriches OGA and the gaming motivation literature by exploring the roles of gaming motivation, psychological ownership, and personal control strategies as they can be a factor in OGA. In addition, this study is the first to investigate the dark side of psychological ownership in terms of negative outcomes for OGA. This study also advances the personal control strategy literature by understanding the roles of primary and secondary control on OGA. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Gaming motivations; Online game addiction; Primary control; Psychological ownership; Secondary control","Electronic assessment; Least squares approximations; Motivation; Surveys; On-line game addictions; Online questionnaire; Outdoor activities; Partial least square (PLS); Primary and secondary control; Psychological ownership; Sports competitions; Structural equation modeling; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100428875

For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Design science; Ethereum; Loot boxes; Online video games; Smart contracts","Decision theory; Human computer interaction; Network security; Sales; Transparency; Decision modeling; Design-science researches; Real-life implementations; Video game industry; Virtual items; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100417331

However, economic growth appears to be in contradiction to planetary boundaries. By developing two worldwide socio-economic models, for forecasting inadequately managed plastic waste up to the year 2050 across 217 countries and territories, we demonstrate the adverse ecological impacts of the lack of regulatory processes and educational environmental programs. We used country-by-country data from the World Bank for the model estimates. The global cumulative stock of plastic waste that is inadequately managed is predicted to increase from 61–72 million metric tons (MT) in 1990 to 5109–5678 MT by 2050. Four scenario analyses told different stories: The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, mitigation scenario 1: Capping GDP, mitigation scenario 2: Extending education, and mitigation scenario 3: Fighting corruption. In “capping GDP,” the annual amount of inadequately managed plastic waste slightly increases and reaches 64–119 million MT/year in 2050 instead of 61–110 million MT/year in the BAU scenario. In the “extending education” scenario, the amount decreases by 34% compared to the BAU scenario in 2050. In the “fighting corruption” scenario, the amount decreases by 60%.

Psychological factors clearly have an impact on their decisions and acceptance behaviours, but these have not been fully explored. Consequently, an understanding of these factors is essential for organisations who wish to accelerate technology adoption as well as for innovators who face numerous barriers when introducing their new products to the industrial market. The upstream oil and gas (O&G) industry has been characterised as reluctant to adopt new technology. The analysis of three technology introduction case studies in the UK offshore O&G sector (including interviews with 22 personnel involved in developing and commercially buying new technology) confirmed the influence of 15 psychological factors on organisational technology adoption decision making. These have been organized into a framework (P-TAF) consisting of six categories of psychological constructs, namely: personality, attitudes, motivation, social, cognitive, and organisational factors. With further development, this preliminary framework can be used to develop interventions that support the successful technology uptake in O&G and in other sectors experiencing resistance to the introduction of new technology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption culture; Decision making; Innovation; Innovation process management; Psychology; Technology acceptance","Behavioral research; Decision making; Gas industry; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Petroleum industry; Decision makers; Industrial markets; Oil and Gas Industry; Organisational; Organisational factors; Psychological factors; Technology adoption; Technology introductions; Offshore technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099447527

However, many East-and-Southeast-Asian countries either achieved or currently are achieving impressively rapid economic growth despite widespread corruption-the so-called East-Asian-Paradox. A common feature of these countries was that they were autocracies. We re-examine the corruption-growth relationship, in light of the East-Asian-Paradox. We examine the role of political regimes, in mediating corruption-growth relationship using panel data over 100 countries for the period 1984-2016. We find clear evidence that corruption-growth relationship differs by the type of political regime, and the growth-enhancing effect of corruption is more likely in autocracies than in democracies. The marginal effect analysis shows that in strongly autocratic countries, higher corruption may lead to significantly higher growth, while this is not the case in democracies. Alternatively, democracy is not good for growth if there is a high level of perceived corruption. We provide suggestive evidence that the mechanism by which corruption is growth-enhancing in autocracies is through the perceived credibility of the commitment of ruling political elites to economic freedom, thereby providing confidence to the firms to invest, leading to long-term growth.

Conventional DEA models are based on a production system by converting inputs to outputs using input-transformation-output processes. However, in some situations, it is inescapable to think of some assessment factors, referred to as dual-role factors, which can play simultaneously input and output roles in DEA. The observed data are often assumed to be precise although it needs to consider uncertainty as an inherent part of most real-world applications. Dealing with imprecise data is a perpetual challenge in DEA that can be treated by presenting the interval data. This paper develops an imprecise DEA approach with dual-role factors based on revised production possibility sets. The resulting models are a pair of mixed binary linear programming problems that yield the possible relative efficiencies in the form of intervals. In addition, a procedure is presented to assign the optimal designation to a dual-role factor and specify whether the dual-role factor is a nondiscretionary input or output. Given the interval efficiencies, the production units are categorized into the efficient and inefficient sets. Beyond the dichotomized classification, a practical ranking approach is also adopted to achieve incremental discrimination through evaluation analysis. Finally, an application to third-party reverse logistics providers is studied to illustrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Dual-role factors; Imprecise data; Production possibility sets; Third-party reverse logistics providers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092460481

Sustainable enhancement of resilience and mitigation capacity of small farm households is a major political economy goal. This paper has the objective to assess the on-farm economic and mitigation benefits of climate-smart agriculture production and their cost-effectiveness to be used as a prioritization criterion for policy incentives. An interdisciplinary model which integrates elements of economics and ecological science at farm-scale is developed and applied using a unique dataset for Malawi and Zambia built through household surveys. Results show that switching from conventional to climate-smart farming enhances economic returns more significantly in semi-dry areas than in sub-humid ones. However, high up-front costs hinder technology adoption. Negative abatement costs for most smart farming options indicate synergies between livelihood enhancement and mitigation. Land management based on minimum tillage, crop residues incorporation, use of cover crops, and inclusion of legumes has relatively higher economic returns. Agroforestry provides lower economic returns but the highest emission abatement potential. Payments for mitigation benefits could be a management strategy to incentivize cleaner agriculture production if tailored appropriately. These results strengthen the case for public support to climate-smart agriculture scaling-up within policy and planning strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-effective mitigation; Ecological-economic model; Marginal abatement cost; Smallholder farming; Sustainable agriculture","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Surveys; Agriculture productions; Ecological science; Emission abatement; Interdisciplinary modeling; Management strategies; Planning strategies; Sub-saharan africa; Technology adoption; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097912895

It is based on empirical study of eight U.S.-based sustainable entrepreneurs, focused on reducing material consumption. While business has a key role to play, many large companies are unwilling to promote SLs as this is contrary to their current business models which are focused on growing consumption and sales. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models who are passionate about sustainability and social impact, and better positioned to take risks and innovate. The research examined emerging business models for advancing SLs, key success factors and challenges reported by the entrepreneurs, the social and environmental impacts of their actions, and the future opportunities for scaling up such practices. The study found that entrepreneurs are well positioned to address simultaneously environmental and social issues, however, they lack resources to effectively measure these impacts to demonstrate an overall positive benefit and strengthen their value proposition. Promoting green attributes alone is not enough to change the behavior of most consumers. It is critically important to emphasize other benefits such as a product/service quality, time or cost savings, or social impact. Social media, formal and informal sustainability networks, IT, sustainability policies, and consumer awareness are key to developing viable business models and competitive strategies that are difficult to replicate. The study found that sustainable entrepreneurs often face “costly” sustainability actions and lack the power to change „the rules of the game“; for this they need to collaborate with other key stakeholders, including NGOs, policy makers, and progressive companies. Based on the research findings the author proposes a new framework for the role of sustainable entrepreneurs as civic and political actors who not only offer innovative products and services, but help educate and influence key stakeholders, develop informal sustainability ecosystem, and thus create momentum for policy changes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Social inequity; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable entrepreneurs; Sustainable lifestyles","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Competitive strategy; Consumer awareness; Innovative product; Key success factors; Material consumption; Social and environmental impact; Sustainability policy; Sustainable entrepreneurs; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094578091

Different social media activities can influence the users' trust and e-satisfaction at different levels, which in turn influence the purchase intentions. This is evident for the food and beverage industry as S-Commerce mediated by social media can help realise a shorter time to market and meet buyer demands. In addition, credibility factors may influence trust and purchase intentions. Understanding the various factors of influence such as social constructs, namely ratings, reviews and referrals; design constructs such as credibility and features and behavioural constructs such as trust, satisfaction and motivation; and analysing the relationship between these factors and how they influence purchase intentions can provide deeper insights into S-Commerce research, decision-making process and purchase intentions particularly from a food and beverage context. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on trust through social media activities and surface credibility as well as e-commerce satisfaction, the authors have proposed a research model to investigate the purchase intention of consumers in S-Commerce platforms. Survey data were collected from six countries in Asia and analysed using SEM-PLS. Findings: Results indicated that both trust and surface credibility significantly influence e-commerce satisfaction leading to purchase intention. Furthermore, surface credibility, which is a novel predictor for purchase intention in S-Commerce context, is highly significant on e-commerce satisfaction. Besides, encouraged by surface credibility, it was identified that trust significantly affects e-commerce satisfaction and results in purchase intention. This research adds contribution to theory and practice in S-Commerce stream as discussed at the end of the paper. Originality/value: The results of this research contribute to the S-Commerce literature and have practical implications for practitioners in the food and beverage industry. As such, focussing on these constructs, this paper analyses the relationship between the social media activities, trust, e-commerce satisfaction, surface credibility and intention to buy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","e-commerce satisfaction; Purchase intention; Social commerce; Social media; Surface credibility; Trust","article; Asia; beverage; consumer; decision making; drawing; human; human experiment; motivation; physician; social media; trust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096074389

Some pursue internal initiatives that reduce their negative social or environmental impacts through responsible operations practices (such as paying a living wage to workers or engaging in environmentally sustainable manufacturing). Others pursue external responsibility initiatives (such as philanthropy or cause-related marketing). Through two experiments conducted in the field and complementary online experiments, we compare how transparency into these internal and external initiatives affects customer perceptions and sales. We find that transparency into both internal and external responsibility initiatives tends to dominate generic brand marketing in motivating consumer purchases, supporting the view that consumers take companies’ responsibility efforts into account in their decision making. Furthermore, the results provide converging evidence that transparency into a company’s internal responsibility practices can be at least as motivating of consumer sales as transparency into its external responsibility initiatives, incrementally increasing a consumer’s probability of purchase by 6.40% and 45.85% across our two field experiments, conducted in social and environmental domains, respectively. Our results suggest that it may be in the interest of both business and society for managers to prioritize internal responsible operations initiatives to achieve both top- and bottom-line benefits while mitigating social and environmental harms. © 2020 INFORMS.","Consumer behavior; Corporate social responsibility; Field experiments; Operational transparency; Sustainable operations","Commerce; Decision making; Environmental impact; Motivation; Purchasing; Sales; Transparency; Bottom-line benefits; Business and societies; Consumer perception; Consumer purchase; Customer perceptions; Environmentally sustainable manufacturing; On-line experiments; Social and environmental; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101021790

The purpose of this study is to examine factors that influence Chinese taxi drivers’ adoption of electric vehicles for living. This study takes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) as the theoretical framework and extends it to examine the influence of taxi drivers’ satisfaction over government's invectives on their adoption of electric vehicles for living (i.e., adoption intention and use behavior). A questionnaire-based survey was conducted in Shenzhen and Guangzhou from November 2018 to April 2019, and 725 valid samples were collected. The model has good explanatory power, and its predictive validity accounts for about 89% of the variance in adoption intention and 50% in use behavior. The statistical results supported that such constructs as Satisfaction with Incentive Policies, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, and Habit, are influencing factors on taxi drivers’ intention of using electric vehicles (i.e., behavior intention). These constructs, together with Social Influence but excluding Habit, are also influential to the actual use of electric vehicles by taxi drivers for living (i.e., use behavior). This study expands the existing theoretical modeling for characterizing the adoption of electrical vehicles. The study suggests policy makers further investigate taxi driver's satisfaction with different incentive policies, and electric vehicle manufacturers focus on improving hedonic motivation for taxi drivers, e.g., providing test-drive experiences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Electric vehicles; Government incentive; Technology acceptance; UTAUT2","Automobile manufacture; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Motivation; Surveys; Taxicabs; Chinese Government; Electrical vehicles; Facilitating conditions; Hedonic motivations; Theoretical framework; Theoretical modeling; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Vehicle manufacturers; Behavioral research; electric vehicle; governance approach; incentive; technological development; technology adoption; transportation technology; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099261531

Based on the inputs from Irish SMEs' experts, a validated conceptual hierarchy model of the identified enablers is developed to analyse and prioritise the most dominant ones. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a questionnaire survey responded by various professionals in Irish manufacturing SMEs. Experts' opinions were analysed using interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) to distinguish the mutual influences amongst the nine identified enablers. Findings: The findings revealed that from the Irish SMEs' perspective, strong green supply chain relations are the outcome of successfully implementing GM and not a driver of the other enablers. Furthermore, lower manufacturing costs are found to arise as a result of GM practices in SMEs. Practical implications: It is discussed that emulating the actions of larger companies will not necessarily yield the same results for SMEs. Innovation will become a cornerstone of remaining competitive in a sustainable environment, which is facilitated by closer green supply chain relations.

Increasing demand for CO2 consumption has urged construction companies and decision-makers to consider ecological efficiency affected by CO2 consumption. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a method capable of analyzing and assessing the eco-efficiency determining factor in Iran’s 22 local cement companies over 2015–2019. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses two well-known artificial intelligence approaches, namely, optimization data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning algorithms at the first and second steps, respectively, to fulfill the research aim. Meanwhile, to find the superior model, the CCR model, BBC model and additive DEA models to measure the efficiency of decision processes are used. A proportional decreasing or increasing of inputs/outputs is the main concern in measuring efficiency which neglect slacks, and hence, is a critical limitation of radial models. Thus, the additive model by considering desirable and undesirable outputs, as a well-known DEA non-proportional and non-radial model, is used to solve the problem. Additive models measure efficiency via slack variables. Considering both input-oriented and output-oriented is one of the main advantages of the additive model. Findings: After applying the proposed model, the Malmquist productivity index is computed to evaluate the productivity of companies over 2015–2019. Although DEA is an appreciated method for evaluating, it fails to extract unknown information. Thus, machine learning algorithms play an important role in this step. Association rules are used to extract hidden rules and to introduce the three strongest rules. Finally, three data mining classification algorithms in three different tools have been applied to introduce the superior algorithm and tool. A new converting two-stage to single-stage model is proposed to obtain the eco-efficiency of the whole system. This model is proposed to fix the efficiency of a two-stage process and prevent the dependency on various weights. Converting undesirable outputs and desirable inputs to final desirable inputs in a single-stage model to minimize inputs, as well as turning desirable outputs to final desirable outputs in the single-stage model to maximize outputs to have a positive effect on the efficiency of the whole process. Originality/value: The performance of the proposed approach provides us with a chance to recognize pattern recognition of the whole, combining DEA and data mining techniques during the selected period (five years from 2015 to 2019). Meanwhile, the cement industry is one of the foremost manufacturers of naturally harmful material using an undesirable by-product; specific stress is given to that pollution control investment or undesirable output while evaluating energy use efficiency.

To gain insight into this complex subject, the team used qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The qualitative effort involved In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with a highly selective group of leading shippers, carriers, and receivers. The IDIs provided insight into the key factors that influence mode choice, and the barriers that limit mode shifts. The quantitative effort estimated econometric models that express freight mode choice as a function of key independent variables. A unique aspect of this research is that the models were estimated using high-quality confidential data under the custody of the United States’ Census Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Surface Transportation Board, including: the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), the largest shipper survey in the world; the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), a comprehensive registry of commercial establishments in the US; and the Waybill Sample, a 5% sample; together with custom-made datasets of modal characteristics prepared by the authors. Using these data, the team estimated discrete-continuous freight mode choice models representing the choice of rail or truck for 42 different commodity types, and different combinations of independent variables and weighting schemes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the research conducted. © 2020","Freight behavior research; Freight mode choice; Freight policy","Public policy; Ships; Surveys; Taxation; Commercial establishments; Freight mode choices; In-depth interviews; Independent variables; Internal revenue services; Modal characteristics; Quantitative research; Surface transportation boards; Freight transportation; econometrics; freight transport; market conditions; public sector; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; research work; transportation policy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097579376

Despite the increasing attention on the role of the construction industry in disaster resilience, CSR reporting on resilience issues among construction practitioners has yet to be explored. The present study adopted the concept of disaster risk management and stakeholder theory and first established a CSR-resilience evaluation framework with 20 resilience issues and 46 indicators through a modified Delphi technique. Thereafter, a sample of 295 international contractors was selected from the Engineering News-Record (ENR) list from 2014 to 2018, and a systematic content analysis approach was conducted to analyze their CSR-related reports and compare the corresponding results among regions. Results indicated that Asian and Middle Eastern contractors have the highest and lowest levels, respectively, of CSR reporting on resilience issues. Clients' and governments' concerns were given the top priority by all regions, except Chinese contractors emphasized the client's and community's concerns. Asian and Chinese contractors showed a higher emphasis on the community's and employees' concerns than those of partners and suppliers, whereas the European, US/Canadian, and Middle Eastern contractors showed otherwise. The present study contributed to filling in the gap to establish a CSR-resilience indicator system for the construction industry and provided a useful reference to comprehensively understand and measure the CSR reporting on resilience issues by the construction industry. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Content analysis; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Disaster risk management (DRM); International contractors; Resilience; Stakeholder theory","Construction industry; Disasters; Economic and social effects; Risk management; Social aspects; Content analysis; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Delphi technique; Disaster resiliences; Engineering news records; Evaluation framework; Indicator system; Stakeholder theory; Contractors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092244470

The ability to measure mental changes with high temporal resolution makes the EEG-based event-related potentials (ERP) method very useful in studying the distinction between consciousness and unconsciousness. Although experiences with brands significantly affect the awareness or unconsciousness of decisions to purchase, ERP studies have ignored experiences of consumers in relation to brand purchases. For this purpose, EEG recordings of participants were taken in the order they saw brand names: experienced brands, review-based brands, and unknown brands. Participants chose one of the three options for the brands they saw on the screen: buying, not buying, and no idea. 35 people participated in the study. The results indicate that early ERPs, which are unconscious mental reactions, related to purchase decisions for previously unknown brands. Late ERPs associated with conscious mental reactions are related to purchasing review-based brands or experienced brands. We conclude that purchasing decisions about unknown brands occur as a result of automatic, unconscious mental processes, whereas purchasing decisions about previously experienced brands and based on consumer reviews result from conscious mental processes. Our study is the first that demonstrates the relationship between ERP's and purchasing decisions, with an experimental design focused on consumer experience and consciousness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conscious and unconscious; Consumer purchase behavior; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Mental processes","brain; decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089739756

A survey assessed the importance of training data towards reflection and decision-making, potential barriers and player preferences. Methods: A total of 176 participants comprising coaches, players and performance staff completed the survey. Results: The training data coaches most commonly identified as wanting to see to support reflection was ‘high-intensity’ actions and variables recognised by the coach as ‘work rate/intensity’. All stake- holders reported training data as at least somewhat important in guiding their coaches’ practices, with lack of a common goal and high volumes of information being the main barriers to effective feedback of training data. Players deemed feedback as positive to change their behaviour, with total distance, high-speed running and sprint distances as the information they would most like to see. It would be likely to be looked at via message or pinned up in the changing room. Conclusion: Training data are seen as an impactful and effective tool for use by all key stakeholders. Despite this, its use can be optimised by increasing opportunities for informal reflection, using less information, and improving communication of data. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coaches; Decision-making; evaluation; performance staff; players; reflection","decision making; feedback system; human; motivation; running; soccer; Decision Making; Feedback; Humans; Motivation; Running; Soccer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087113807

Particularly, following the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21)-Paris agreement and global financial crisis, it is important to assess the causal relationship between energy market, stock market, and green stock returns. Accordingly, this study employed different quantile-causality approaches to conduct a detailed analysis of the asymmetric causal relationship associated with different market regimes (normal, bad, and good). Overall, our parametric Granger-causality findings show that clean energy markets react to crude oil and stock markets depending on the market regime. Additionally, the cross-correlogram test revealed that there are negative and significant cross relations when the stock market is in bullish condition and clean energy indices in bearish conditions. These findings have important implications for portfolio diversification and hedging decisions of environmentally concerned investors.

Extensive studies explored how online reviews might influence sales, however, the results have been inconsistent. This study explores whether and how consumers might incorporate online reviews into decision making based on signaling theory and examines when online review valence influences sales and when it might not. In a signaling perspective, online reviews might serve as a product quality signal, and subsequently, consumers might incorporate less the online review information into decision making if other product information cues such as expert ratings or brands help to verify the product quality. The findings from 633,029 consumer decisions on a hotel-booking website indicate that product quality information cues moderate the effect of online reviews on purchase likelihood. Also, product quality information cues were highly endogenous in estimating the effect of online reviews on sales.

Although the appeal of personalized pricing is clear, it may also incur large costs in the forms of market research, investment in information technology and analytics expertise, and branding risks. In light of these trade-offs, our work studies the value of personalized pricing strategies over a simple single-price strategy. We first provide closed-form lower and upper bounds on the ratio between the profits of an idealized personalized pricing strategy (first-degree price discrimination) and a single-price strategy. Our bounds depend on simple statistics of the valuation distribution and shed light on the types of markets for which personalized pricing has little or significant potential value. Second, we consider a feature-based pricing model where customer valuations can be estimated from observed features. We show how to transform our aforementioned bounds into lower and upper bounds on the value of feature-based pricing over single pricing depending on the degree to which the features are informative for the valuation. Finally, we demonstrate how to obtain sharper bounds by incorporating additional information about the valuation distribution (moments or shape constraints) by solving tractable linear optimization problems.

The results show a positive association among customer experience, perceived value, and customer loyalty. Notably, the physical environment and human interaction are equally important in influencing customers' value judgments about their consumption experience. Moreover, perceived value has a stronger positive effect on attitudinal loyalty than on behavioral loyalty. This study adds new insights into the customer experience-perceived value-customer loyalty path by showing that the physical environment and human interaction have the same importance in affecting perceived value and identifying the subtle difference between attitudinal and behavioral loyalty influenced by perceived value in the accommodation-sharing economy.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 15 barriers to BDA adoption were identified through literature review and expert opinions. Data were collected from three types of industries: automotive, machine tools and electronics manufacturers in India. The grey-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was employed to explore the cause–effect relationship amongst barriers. Further, the barrier's influences were outranked and cross-validated through analytic network process (ANP). Findings: The results showed that “lack of data storage facility”, “lack of IT infrastructure”, “lack of organisational strategy” and “uncertain about benefits and long terms usage” were most common barriers to adopt BDA practices in all three industries. Practical implications: The findings of the study can assist service providers, industrial managers and government organisations in understanding the barriers and subsequently evaluating interrelationships and ranks of barriers in the successful adoption of BDA in a manufacturing organisation context. Originality/value: The paper is one of the initial efforts in evaluating the barriers to BDA in improving the performance of manufacturing firms in India. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytic network process; Barriers; Big data analytics; Grey-DEMATEL; Manufacturing industry; Sustainable performance","Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Digital storage; Electronics industry; Machine tools; Manufacture; Analytic network process; Design/methodology/approach; Electronics manufacturers; Grey decision making; Industrial managers; Literature reviews; Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing organisations; Advanced Analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102578794

In this study, we propose a two-step solution to the problem of emerging topic prediction. The first step forecasts the future popularity score, a novel indicator reflecting the impact and growth, of candidate topics in a time-series manner. The second step selects novel topics from the candidates predicted to be popular in the first step. Terms with domain characteristics are used as candidate topics. Deep neural networks, specifically LSTM and NNAR, are applied with nine features of topics to predict popularity score. We evaluated the models and five baselines on two datasets from two perspectives, i.e., the ability to (1) predict the correct indicator value and (2) reconstruct the optimal ranking order. Two types of training strategies were compared, including a global strategy that trains a model with all topics and two local strategies that train separate models with different groups of topics. Our results show that LSTM and NNAR outperform other models in predicting the value of popularity score measured by MAE and RMSE, while LightGBM is a competitive baseline in ranking the topics in terms of NDCG@20. The performance difference of global and local strategies is not significant. Emerging topics predicted by our approach are compared with those by other methods. A qualitative assessment on nominated emerging topics suggests topics nominated by machine learning methods are more alike than those by the rule-based model. Some important topics are nominated according to a preliminary literature analysis. This study exploited the strengths of both machine learning and bibliometric indicator approaches for emerging topic prediction. Deep neural networks are applied where objective optimization target can be defined and measured. Bibliometric indicator offers an efficient way to select novel topics from candidates. The hybrid approach shows promise in considering various characteristics of emerging topics when making predictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometric indicator; Emerging topic prediction; Neural network; Time series forecasting","Deep neural networks; Long short-term memory; Time series; Bibliometric indicators; Emerging topic prediction; Emerging topics; Global strategies; Local strategies; Neural-networks; Policy makers; Research topics; Time series forecasting; Times series; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105692486

The purpose of the research is to compare the relative sustainability of alternative ways to deal with this waste, these being: landfill, incineration with heat recovery, co-processing in cement kilns, making furniture and bridge fabrication. The method is to use the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to select 11 metrics for sustainability. The use of the SDGs adds to the objectivity of this process overcoming one of the principal weaknesses of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Quantitative information methods from Life Cycle Assessment, Geographic Information Science, census data and real options analysis of R&D, alongside qualitative information from Delphi studies and Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats analysis are combined in the assessment. Three MCDA methods are used, each calculates economic, social and environmental sustainability indices for the end-of-life alternatives which are then combined into integrated sustainability indices. A novel Delphi stopping condition based on consensus, consistency and convergence is used. The primary result is that bridge fabrication is the most sustainable alternative with furniture making in second place. Co-processing, incineration with heat recovery and landfill are progressively less sustainable alternatives. This result is robust to substantial changes in the selection of experts’ opinions, the weights for MCDA and the values of the metrics. These findings offer researchers and policymakers a robust decision making process, applicable to situations where choices are made on sustainability criteria. © 2021","Composite Recycling; Delphi Study; Geographic Information Science (GIS); Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)","Decision making; Geographic information systems; Glass fibers; Land fill; Life cycle; Planning; Population statistics; Site selection; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Waste incineration; Wind turbines; Composite recycling; DELPHI study; End of lives; Geographic information science; Glass fiber reinforced polymer; Life cycle assessment; Multiple criteria decision analyse; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Sustainability index; Wind turbine blades; Sustainable development; Delphi analysis; GIS; life cycle analysis; multicriteria analysis; polymer; recycling; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; wind turbine; analysis; Article; bridge fabrication; cement kiln co processing; census data and real options analysis of R and D; Delphi stopping condition; economic aspect; environmental aspects and related phenomena; furniture making; geographic information science; incineration; incineration with heat recovery; information processing; information science; landfill; life cycle assessment; multicriteria decision analysis; social aspect; Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats analysis; Sustainability Index; sustainable development; UN Sustainable Development Goal; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105565682

The forecasting process is becoming more complicated by virtue of evolving retail technology trends. Demand volatility and speed are highly affected by e-commerce strategies as well as social media usage regards to varying customer preferences, short product lifecycles, obsolescence of the retail calendar, and lack of information for newly launched seasonal items. Consumers have become more demanding and less predictable in their purchasing behavior that expects high quality, guaranteed availability and fast delivery. Meeting high expectations of customers’ initiates with proper demand management. This study focuses on demand prediction with a data-driven perspective by both leveraging machine learning techniques and identifying significant predictor variables to help fashion retailers achieve better forecast accuracy.

Up to date, research examining the impact of energy accessibility on income inequality remain scarce. To contribute to knowledge and policy, this study utilizes a comprehensive dataset for 166 countries to investigate the impact of energy accessibility on income inequality for the period 1990–2017. Utilizing a two-stage generalized-method of moment (IV-GMM) approach, the empirical results indicated that access to electricity reduces global income inequality, while access to modern and clean energy increase global income inequality. On spatial accessibility to energy, rural and urban electrification were found to reduce global income inequality; however, the estimated elasticity of urban electrification exceeds rural electrification. The results further revealed that access to electricity, modern and clean energy, as well as rural and urban electrification moderate the impact of economic growth and education to improve global income inequality. The findings also indicated that employment, economic growth, education, gender empowerment, industrialization, and health are some of the potential channels through which access to energy influences global income inequality. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the direct and indirect effect of energy accessibility on income inequality varies between Latin America-Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, and Europe & Central Asia countries. The findings are robust to alternative econometric estimators and different measures of income inequality. We, therefore, argue that access to energy is a pre-condition for improving global income inequality. © 2021","Clean energy; Economic growth; Education; Electricity; Income inequality","Economic analysis; Method of moments; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Urban growth; Clean energy; Economic growths; Energy; Energy increase; Generalized method of moments; Income inequality; Indirect effects; Industrialisation; Rural and urban; Rural electrification; Electric utilities; econometrics; economic growth; education; electricity; income distribution; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105074675

In light of this, we estimate energy efficiency trends using index decomposition analysis, data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis as robust methods. The driving factors (including asymmetric price responses) are examined using a dynamic panel model estimated by Arellano and Bond (1991) GMM estimator. The application for 32 OECD countries found that none of the three methods leads to a consistent ranking between energy efficiency estimates and energy intensity – corroborating the criticism that energy intensity is not a good proxy for energy efficiency. The panel-data regressions using the energy efficiency estimates from the three methods show similarities in the impacts of the drivers (including energy price, foreign direct inflows, trade openness, population growth, temperature etc.) on energy efficiency. Although the results of asymmetric price responses of energy efficiency estimates vary slightly, we found insignificant evidence of asymmetric effects of total energy price but there are asymmetric responses with energy-specific prices. Thus, using energy-specific prices as well as allowing for asymmetric price effects in analysing drivers of energy efficiency is apt and informative in formulating energy policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric price effects; Data envelopment analysis; Dynamic panel data regression for OECD; Energy efficiency; Index decomposition analysis; Stochastic frontier analysis","Cost estimating; Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Asymmetric energy; Asymmetric price effect; Data envelopment; Dynamic panel data regression for OECD; Energy; Energy intensity; Energy prices; Index decomposition analyses (IDA); Price response; Stochastic frontier analysis; Stochastic systems; data envelopment analysis; dynamic analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; OECD; regression analysis; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103090877

Thus, researchers rely on the collection and analysis of expert opinions as an alternative method. Delphi, the nominal group technique, and focus groups often are used to solicit opinions through different processes and controls. Controls implemented during data collection and analysis techniques such as anonymity, multiple rounds, and controlled feedback are used to decrease cognitive and social biases that threaten the validity and reliability of the results. Although there are standard processes for these methods, researchers commonly make modifications to balance research constraints with the study objectives, and it often is unclear how specific modifications promote or degrade the validity and reliability of the results. This paper comprehensively reviewed the existing literature on expert opinion-based studies and argues that seemingly innocuous changes to the traditional methodological frameworks can introduce cognitive biases. A novel conceptual decision-making framework is presented to assist the research community with the development of rigorous experimental designs and transparent interpretation of results when various permutations of key controls are included or omitted in the execution of expert-opinion studies. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cognitive biases; Expert opinions; Qualitative research controls","Decision making; Reliability analysis; Analysis techniques; Construction engineering; Data collection; Decision-making frameworks; Methodological frameworks; Nominal group techniques; Research communities; Resource Constraint; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101986466

To assess the social welfare effects, we focus on the energy mix as a policy tool and incorporate two factors into the model: cost-efficiency and climate damage. For model calibration, we use U.S. data of levelized cost of energy, carbon dioxide emission intensity, and carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere; thus, the analysis is within the scope of the U.S. energy policy. The results show that a 10% increase in the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix decreases social welfare by 0.753% in the long run. This negative welfare effect of the increase in renewable energy use occurs because the negative effect of reduced cost-efficiency outweighs the positive effect of less climate damage on social welfare.

Building information modeling (BIM) has been classified as a systemic innovation that is adopted by building projects, firms, and users. However, the slow diffusion of BIM in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector has maintained the gap between BIM visions and actual BIM practice. Some governments are planning to enact policies to promote BIM adoption in construction. However, in some countries, BIM adoption has already started with large construction organizations (i.e., the middle-out diffusion approach). To learn from previous experience and before enacting top-down interventions, policymakers require a model to stimulate systemic BIM adoption for entire supply chains with fragmented project and organizational structures. The current paper investigates the systemic adoption of digital innovations in construction and is aimed at formulating a model of systemic BIM adoption (MSBA). Three primary datasets consisting of 133 BIM users, 30 chief executive officers, and 20 project managers were collected in Peru and collectively analyzed using cross-classified multilevel modeling (CCMM). It was found that MSBA has five user-, three firm-, and two project-level factors, explaining 28%, 75%, and 50% of the variance in users' BIM adoption, respectively. The proposed model would provide useful guidance for corporate decision makers and government policymakers to develop BIM-diffusion policies to accelerate adoption. It would also provide a useful practical implementation framework as the industry progresses toward a digital mode of working and could underpin further digitalization of the sector worldwide. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Building information modeling (BIM) adoption; Firm; Middle-out diffusion; Project coalition; Systemic innovation; User","Decision making; Diffusion; Supply chains; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Building Information Model - BIM; Chief executive officer; Construction organizations; Diffusion policies; Digital innovations; Organizational structures; Systemic innovation; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100633956

However, existing studies on the impact of R&D subsidies have found mixed or conflicting results. Insights from resource dependence theory (RDT) and the Attention-Based View (ABV) help account for these discrepancies. This study of Chinese high technology firms using the Innovation-Oriented Firms Database from the Ministry of Science and Technology, finds an inverted U-shaped relationship between R&D subsidies and innovation performance. The article shows that high government resource dependency, expressed through high percentage of R&D spending coming from government subsidies, diverts attention resources in recipient firms and results in declining innovation performance. The article then tests the impacts of different managerial responses on the dependency-innovation relationship and find that technology alliances and employee feedback systems mitigate these negative effects. These findings have implications for government innovation policies and firm-level responses to those policies: government subsidy policies have limits to their effectiveness and firms have strategic options for capitalizing on government resources without sacrificing innovativeness. © 2021 Product Development & Management Association","government subsidies; innovation; organizational structure","Economics; Public policy; Technology transfer; Attention-based views; Government subsidies; High technology firms; High technology industries; Innovation performance; Ministry of science and technologies; Resource dependences; Resource dependencies; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104632875

We test these predictions using historical indicators of inequality, dating back to the 1700s, and data on the informal economy across 138 countries over the 1991–2015 period. We find that past levels of inequality are the most salient factors explaining the size of the informal economy, while improving credit access, reducing tax burden and business costs play a minor role. These results are robust to using alternative inequality measures from various years during the 1700–1992 period, using instrumental variables, and four alternative measurements of the informal economy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the informal economy is converging to the same steady state. Instead, there is convincing evidence of club convergence. Countries with the highest levels of initial inequality are diverging from those that started with lower levels of inequality and those who have made significant redistribution. Results suggest the importance of early conditions in determining the persistence of the dual economy with important policy implications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Club convergence; Inequality; Informal economy; Institutions","convergence; dual economy; economic growth; informal sector; organization; persistence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094918198

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed SSTRA utilises the analytic hierarchy process to prioritise smart SME requirements, a graphical interface which tracks technologies' benchmarks under Industry 4.0 Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs); a mathematical model used to determine the technology readiness and visual representation to understand the relative readiness of each smart main area. The validity of the SSTRA is confirmed by testing it in a real industrial environment. In addition, the conceptual model for Smart product design development is proposed and validated. Findings: The proposed SSTRA offers decision-makers the facility to identify requirements and rank them to reflect the current priorities of the enterprise. It allows SMEs to assess their current capabilities in a range of technologies of high relevance to the Industry 4.0 area. The SSTRA assembles a readiness profile allowing decision-makers to not only perceive the overall score of technology readiness but also the distribution of technology readiness across the main smart areas. It helps to visualise strengths and weaknesses; whilst emphasising the fundamental gaps that require serious action to assist the program with a well-balanced effort towards a successful transition to Industry 4.0.

In order to characterize this ability, however, one must be able to quantitatively measure the relative level of resilience that a given system displays in response to a disruptive event. Such a measurement should be easily understandable and straightforward to implement, but it should also utilize a consistent frame of reference so that one can properly compare the relative performance of different systems and assess the relative effectiveness of different resilience investments. With this in mind, this paper presents an improved approach for measuring system resilience that supports better decision making by providing both consistency and flexibility across different contexts. The theoretical basis for the approach is developed first, and then its advantages and limitations are illustrated in the context of several different practical examples. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support; Disaster operations management; Predicted resilience; Quantitative modeling","Decision making; Uncertainty analysis; Disaster resiliences; Disruptive event; Frame of reference; Global society; Measuring systems; Relative performance; Socio-economic systems; System displays; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092657429

We identify that these commodities contain high proportions of market-specific price discontinuities, which do not translate into systematic jumps. Co-jumps in the same direction lead to higher correlations and imply reduction in diversification benefits, while co-jumps in the opposite direction reduce correlations and positively affect diversification, similar to the idiosyncratic jumps. The results also demonstrate that the risk-averse investor's gold portfolio allocations are not affected by co-jumps and are free from the non-diversifiable risks in oil and copper markets. However, idiosyncratic jumps in oil and copper markets increase allocations to gold. In contrast, allocations to copper and oil are significantly affected by the systematic risks outlined in copper–gold and oil–gold pairs, pushing risk-averse investors to oil from copper–gold and copper from oil–gold systematic risks. Finally, diversification benefits from price discontinuities are overall positive and driven by the idiosyncratic jumps in oil and copper markets when the minimum variance portfolio allocations are used. © 2021","Copper market; COVID-19 pandemic; Gold market; Jumps and Co-jumps; Oil market; Portfolio allocations","Commerce; Financial markets; Gold; Investments; Risk analysis; % reductions; Allocation decision; Copper markets; COVID-19 pandemic; Gold market; Jump and co-jump; Oil market; Portfolio allocation; Risk averse; Systematic risk; Copper; copper; correlation; COVID-19; economic diversification; gold; oil production; resource allocation; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119451288

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is considered one of the most effective strategies to counter these trends by reducing the carbon footprint of existing and upcoming infrastructure. Utilization of captured CO2 (CCU) to produce valuable green chemicals is an economically viable proposition. On the other hand, storage of CO2 (CCS) reduces the carbon footprint by sequestering the captured CO2 in geological formations, which in some cases, facilitates hydrocarbon recovery. This paper showcases how a multifaceted approach of combining CCU and CCS in an economically viable manner is a key factor in the maintaining of sustainable development. We discuss at a systems level, the benefits of the implementation of CCUS for India's energy security, positive path dependency, and resiliency. This is followed by a bottom-up review of the symbiotic relationship between the capture and utilization/storage. We provide an assessment of sustainable CCUS implementation by pairing state-of-the-art technologies in the field of carbon storage/utilization with possible future directions in India. We also suggest pathways for the potential and the impact of India's carbon-intensive sources in different CCUS chains such as markets for large-scale utilization of CO2 in emerging methanol economy. Finally, we provide research and policy recommendations that would facilitate a sustainable collaborative effort across sectors in mitigating the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CCUS; Energy security; Geologic sequestration; Grid diversity; India; Stranded assets","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Economics; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Growth rate; Carbon storage; Carbon utilization; CO$-2$/ emission; Compounded annual growth rates; Economically viable; Energy; Geologic sequestrations; Grid diversity; India; Stranded asset; Energy security; bottom-up approach; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; policy approach; research; sustainable development; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113223725

Prominent studies have highlighted various critical success factors of project success; however, the effects of authoritarian leadership and project team member's silence have been completely overlooked, especially in mega construction projects. The present study makes a pioneering effort to address this critical research gap and investigate the effects of authoritarian leadership and project team member's silence on the multi-dimensional success (including project management success, project ownership success and project investment success) in a mega construction project. Drawing on data from 357 project professionals directly associated with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and covariance based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) with Mplus, the findings provide new empirical evidence that authoritarian leadership has a significant negative influence on the multi-dimensional success in the CPEC mega construction project. The findings also establish that project team member's silence negatively mediates the relationship between authoritarian leadership and the multi-dimensional mega construction project success.

While this potential has been frequently highlighted and evidenced from single case applications, we still lack a deeper theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms how digital technologies can support process improvement in general, and lean practices more specifically. In this paper, we use a qualitative study based on focus group design to understand how manufacturing and supply chain management professionals perceive the potential of digital technologies in support of lean practices. We identify eight digital waste reduction mechanisms that illustrate how digital technologies can support lean practices. These include a cluster of mechanisms that augment operational execution in terms of speed and precision of execution, as well as flexibility in space and time. Furthermore, we identify a second cluster of mechanisms that augment decision-making through visibility, feedback, engagement, and prevention. In terms of managerial implications, our findings provide firms with a structured approach how to identify those digital technologies that can most effectively support their respective process improvement activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Digital transformation; Industry 4.0; Lean manufacturing; Process improvement","Agile manufacturing systems; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Process engineering; Supply chain management; Waste management; Autonomous Vehicles; Chain management; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Focus groups; Group Design; Lean practices; Process Improvement; Qualitative study; Technology support; Lean production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113275659

One area that has great potential to leverage the value of big data and analytics is the critical analysis of traffic accidents. Investigation results help in providing an in-depth understanding of the risks and provide measures to potentially prevent these risk factors hence enhancing the well-being of individuals who may experience such accidents. This study explains existing models and proposes a data science methodology in a field where probabilistic modeling makes much sense for faster, better decision-making. The main objective of this data analytics study is to identify the high-risk factors with their apparent significance to influence the probability of injury severity on automobile crashes using a geographically representative car crash dataset. To obtain reliable, accurate, and intuitive results, a multi-step probabilistic inference model based on Bayesian Belief Network— highly-acclaimed machine learning methodology—is proposed. The underlying inference model provides researchers with a causally accurate way to explore the domain (with the subject matter expert inputs) while disengaging issues related to statistical correlations and causal effects. In this study, we also used the data to create a web-based probabilistic inference simulator, a Bayesian inference decision support tool, which will be a publicly available/accessible tool, to help decision-makers better understand and to conduct what-if analysis on variable interdependencies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian inference; Cross-entropy loss function, Bayesian missing data handling; Data science; Decision making; Injury severity","Advanced Analytics; Bayesian networks; Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision support systems; Health risks; Inference engines; Risk assessment; Bayesian inference model; Decision support tools; In-depth understanding; Probabilistic inference; Probabilistic inference models; Probabilistic modeling; Statistical correlation; Subject matter experts; Accidents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103562060

The empirical approach in this study exploits a plausibly exogenous variation in historical migration shocks to instrument for ethnic fractionalization. Regression results show that ethnic fractionalization leads to an increase in energy poverty among Nepalese households. In particular, energy poverty induced by ethnic fractionalization is severe among low-caste individuals, suggesting prospects of energy injustice in a caste-based hierarchical society. Among different channels, income appears to mediate the effect of ethnic fractionalization on energy poverty in the context of Nepal. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a significant drop in energy poverty from a change in income induced by ethnic fractionalization results in a national economic gain of approximately $3.2 million. Results indicate that policies aimed at enhancing local income can be effective in eradicating energy poverty in a developing country setting. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Caste; Energy expenditure; Ethnic diversity; Fuel poverty; Income; Nepal","Economics; Caste; Empirical approach; Energy; Energy expenditure; Energy poverties; Ethnic diversity; Fuel poverty; Income; Nepal; Peoples energies; Developing countries; caste system; developing world; energy resource; ethnicity; household income; low income population; poverty; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113949139

Using the theoretical lens of resource orchestration theory (ROT) and contingency theory (CT), this study explores the relationships between EO, external environmental information exchange (EEIE) (with suppliers and customers), and EP. In particular, this study investigates the mediating role of EEIE between EO and EP, and the moderating effect of EO on the relationship between EEIE and EP. The proposed relationships were analysed through structural equation modelling and hierarchical linear regression analysis using survey data collected in Australia. The results reveal the partial mediating effect of EEIE on the EO-EP link, and the contingency effect of EO on the relationship between EEIE (with customers) and EP. Our study extends the boundaries of the current understanding by empirically testing both mediation and moderation within the same study, thereby presenting insights into how EO can positively influence EP, and under what circumstances. These findings provide managers with useful guidance on how EO can be complemented by external information sharing for environmental solutions. © 2021","Environmental information exchange with suppliers and customers; Environmental orientation; Environmental performance","Environmental management; Regression analysis; Sales; Contingency theory; Environmental information; Environmental information exchange with supplier and customer; Environmental orientation; Environmental performance; Information exchanges; Mediating roles; Moderating effect; Structural equation models; Theory theories; Information dissemination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109626529

However, such responses may be ineffective because they are unspecific and add little information to reviewers' comments. To address this dilemma, we examine the degree of managers' rote responses to identify the similarity of managers' response texts. Basing on panel data of 334,671 reviews and 169,794 manager responses from 868 hotels in TripAdvisor, we find that customers leave fewer reviews and lower review valence during the subsequent month, when the level of roteness of managers’ responses is higher. However, rote responses only decrease the volume of subsequent positive reviews but have no influence on the volume of negative reviews. Moreover, such effects are weaker for chain hotels than for independent ones. Therefore, managers should differentiate their responses to online reviews, particularly for independent hotels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hotel management; Information quality; Levenshtein distance; Online review; Response customization; Rote response","economic impact; hospitality industry; information technology; management; tourism market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105734320

The proposed spillover effects are moderated by (a) whether the related (covisited) products are complementary or substitutive, (b) the choice of media channel (mobile or personal computer (PC)) used, (c) whether the related products are from the same or a different brand, (d) consumer experience, and (e) the variance of the review ratings. To identify complementary and substitutive products, we develop supervised machine-learning models based on product characteristics, such as product category and brand, and novel text-based similarity measures. We train and validate the machine-learning models using product pair labels from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that the mean rating of substitutive (complementary) products has a negative (positive) effect on purchasing of the focal product. Interestingly, the magnitude of the spillover effects of the mean ratings of covisited (substitutive and complementary) products is significantly larger than the effects on the focal product, especially for complementary products. The spillover effect of ratings is stronger for consumers who use mobile devices versus PCs. We find the negative effect of the mean ratings of substitutive products across different brands on purchasing of a focal product to be significantly higher than within the same brand. Lastly, the effect of the mean ratings is stronger for less experienced consumers and for ratings with lower variance.

In this paper, we focus on how social media sentiment affects mass media sentiment. Using data from Sina Weibo and Sina Finance (around 60 million weibos and 6.2 million news articles), we show that social media does influence mass media sentiment emergence for financial news. The sentiment consistency between social media reaction and prior news articles amplifies the persistence of mass media sentiment over time. By contrast, we found limited evidence of social media reducing the persistence of mass media sentiment over time.

However, the low end-user penetration of the smart-home market as of 2021 points out towards the fact that the users are resistant to use home IoT and smart-home solutions. Privacy concerns is an important factor that hinders the smart-home adoption as per existing literatures. Unfortunately, current smart-home literatures have not focused enough on the theoretical aspect of the privacy concern construct per se, what are its various antecedents, and what constitutes the users’ privacy concerns. Consequently, in this work a resistive modelling approach is used focusing on the privacy aspect that hinders the diffusion of IoT-based smart-homes in the society. Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) and Multidimensional Development Theory (MDT) are used as the theoretical background. Multiple antecedents of privacy concern are considered ranging from individual (user skill), technological to environmental factors (legal & policy aspect). Moreover, privacy concern is treated from three aspects of informational privacy, physical privacy, and psychological privacy. The proposed model is validated and tested using data collected from 463 users residing in Thailand. The differences in privacy perception and its effect on user resistance depending on gender and residence type is also discussed. Results show that the user characteristics of user skill has the highest impact on privacy concern, followed by legal & policy aspect, and technological aspect respectively.

Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges. For example, ADMS may produce discriminatory outcomes, violate individual privacy, and undermine human self-determination. New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define EBA as a structured process whereby an entity’s present or past behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant principles or norms. We then offer three contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting procedural regularity and transparency. Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully. Third, we identify and discuss the conceptual, technical, social, economic, organisational, and institutional constraints associated with EBA. We conclude that EBA should be considered an integral component of multifaced approaches to managing the ethical risks posed by ADMS. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Auditing; Automated decision-making; Ethics; Governance","article; artificial intelligence; automation; decision making; drug efficacy; ethics; feasibility study; human; organization; privacy; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109662816

We show that the impulse responses of gold returns and volatility to EPU shocks are time-varying and exhibit asymmetric patterns alternately over the sample period. While the effect of EPU on gold volatility is generally stronger in the intermediate to long horizons, the opposite is observed in the case of gold returns, underscoring the additive effects of uncertainty shocks on gold market volatility. The effect of EPU on gold volatility is found to be asymmetric with respect to the nature of shocks and stronger in times of crisis or major events, with such events implied by high EPU values associated with positive volatility jumps in the gold market. Our findings have significant implications for the valuation of gold derivatives and the effectiveness of gold as a potential hedge for financial investors and suggest that investors may risk mis-valuations and consequently, ineffective and costly hedges in response to uncertainty shocks if the time-variation in the response of gold return dynamics to uncertainty shocks is ignored. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic policy uncertainty; Gold returns; Intraday volatility; TVP-VAR model With stochastic volatility","Commerce; Gold; Gold compounds; Investments; Planning; Public policy; Stochastic models; Value engineering; Wooden fences; Dynamic effects; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Gold market; Gold return; High frequency data; Intraday volatility; Time varying parameter; Time varying parameter VAR model with stochastic volatility; Uncertainty; Stochastic systems; economic policy; frequency analysis; gold; mineral resource; resource economy; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104146249

However, the United States’ coronavirus response faced data gaps, inadequate and inconsistent definitions of data across different governmental jurisdictions, ambiguous timing in reporting, problems in accessing data, and changing interpretations from scientific institutions. These present numerous problems for the decision makers relying on this information. This paper documents some of the data pitfalls in coronavirus public health data reporting, as identified by the authors in the course of supporting data management for New England's coronavirus response. We provide recommendations for individuals to collect data more effectively during emergency situations such as a COVID-19 surge, as well as recommendations for institutions to provide more meaningful data for various users to access. Through this, we hope to motivate action to avoid data pitfalls during public health responses in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; Decision making; Public health data","Information management; Public health; Accessing data; Coronaviruses; Data gap; Data usage; Decision makers; Decisions makings; Health data; Policy makers; Public health data; Scientific institutions; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103688560

The antecedents of preparation are poorly understood, in part, because experience by itself only partly explains the story. To address these concerns, we developed two unique surveys: one from an international survey in 18 disaster-prone countries and another from a U.S. survey in New York City and Miami. We find that organizational experience with natural disasters increases preparedness for future hazards. Also, organizational learning from other businesses and organiztions positively mediates this relationship. Managers are more willing to learn from others in locations characterized by high-impact, low-frequency disasters. In areas with low impact, high frequency disasters, managers more likely misjudge the severity of natural disasters. Managerial Summary: Despite the increasing frequency and severity of floods, storms, wildfires and other natural hazards, why do some firms in disaster-prone areas prepare while others do not? To investigate, we conducted two studies: an international survey in 18 disaster-prone countries and a U.S. survey in New York City and Miami. In both surveys, managers are more likely to prepare when their companies experienced prior disasters. Managers operating in locations characterized by high-impact, low-frequency disasters are more willing to learn from others. In contrast, managers in areas characterized by low impact, high frequency disasters, are more likely to prepare alone. Since effective disaster preparation typically entails working with, and learning from others, those companies that choose a go-it-alone strategy may misjudge disaster risk. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","disaster preparation; global survey; natural disaster; organizational learning; risk perception","Hazards; Location; Managers; Storms; Surveys; High frequency HF; High impact; International survey; Low-frequency; Natural disasters; Natural hazard; New York city; Organizational learning; Disasters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102416451

Considering the Choquet integral based on a 2-additive capacity (non additive weights for considered criteria), we present a procedure to find all minimal sets of pairs of interacting criteria representing the preference information provided by the Decision Maker (DM). Robustness concerns are also addressed applying the Robust Ordinal Regression and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis. Even if in different ways, both of them provide recommendations on the hierarchical sorting problem at hand by exploring the whole set of capacities compatible with the preferences provided by the DM.

The Indonesian food industry has contributed to an increasing trend of waste generation in the landfill due to irresponsible consumer behaviors resulting a failure in a consumption transition from being traditional to sustainable. Prior studies have indicated that there is a gap between consumers’ intentions and their behaviors. In response, this study attempts to identify the attributes causing such a gap by focusing on consumer behaviors. The model validity is measured by the economic value using consumer WTP. In order to answer the objectives, this study uses a combination of fuzzy Delphi method and choice experiment method with an advantage of being able to assess the attributes based on the expert judgments and consumer preferences, while other studies have not used the combination of these two methods. The results show that social concerns and waste minimization perspectives contribute the most to the sustainable consumption model in which the criteria such as consumers’ sustainable issue interest, responsible waste disposal and health-based products play a major role in influencing consumer WTP. Therefore, based on the perspectives and criteria assessment results, this study contributes to the literature and industry with theoretical and managerial implications. © 2021","Choice experiment; Consumer behaviors; Fuzzy Delphi method; Sustainable consumption transition; Willingness-to-pay","Conservation; Decision making; Waste disposal; Choice experiments; Food industries; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Social concerns; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable consumption transition; Transition modelling; Waste generation; Waste minimization; Willingness to pay; Consumer behavior; consumption behavior; Delphi analysis; environmental economics; food industry; waste disposal; willingness to pay; article; consumer attitude; decision making; Delphi study; food industry; human; landfill; theoretical study; validity; waste disposal; waste minimization; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103638334

Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is an important tool for decision problem solving due to simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria and objectives. Various MCDM methods are continually emerging and tend to be increasingly adopted to address the real-world construction problems. Therefore, it is urged to systematically review the existing body of literature to demonstrate the evolution of the mainstream MCDM methods in general and their application status in construction. A total of 530 construction articles published from 2000 to 2019 are selected in this study and then categorized into seven major application areas using a novel systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The bibliometric analysis is then used to describe the research trend. Subsequently, the qualitative discussion by themes is conducted to analyze the application of MCDM methods in construction. A further discussion makes it possible to identify the potential challenges (e.g. applicability, robustness, postpone effect, dynamic and prospective challenges and scale problem) to existing research. It also contributes to the recommendation of future directions for the development of MCDM methods that would benefit construction research and practice. © VGTU.

To this end, we analyze the deployment of electric commercial vehicles in retail mid-haul logistics fleets for current and future technology scenarios. We develop a novel assessment methodology that combines total cost of ownership calculations with a rich location-routing model. We consider integrated strategic network design and operational routing decisions over a multi-period time horizon, accounting for mixed fleets of electric and conventional vehicles and battery degradation. To solve this problem, we develop a novel matheuristic that embeds a state-of-the-art metaheuristic to take operational routing decisions. With this framework, we analyze a possible transition towards electrified logistics fleets. Starting with a real-world case, we perform sensitivity analyses based on a technology roadmap and further network structures. We discuss cost structures, the time-dependent nature of investment decisions, operational characteristics, and potential emissions savings. We show that in certain cases an electrification of mid-haul logistics fleets is operationally feasible, economically viable, and provides environmental advantages. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Case study; Electric commercial vehicles; Routing; Sustainable logistics","Automobiles; Costs; Economics; Investments; Sensitivity analysis; Assessment methodologies; Integrated planning; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Investment decisions; Operational characteristics; Sustainable transportation; Technology roadmaps; Total cost of ownership; Commercial vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095846910

Model averaging aims at providing an insurance against selecting a poor forecast model. All existing model averaging approaches in the literature are designed with constant (non-time-varying) combination weights. Little attention has been paid to time-varying model averaging, which is more realistic in economics under structural changes. This paper proposes a novel model averaging estimator which selects optimal time-varying combination weights by minimizing a local jackknife criterion. It is shown that the proposed time-varying jackknife model averaging (TVJMA) estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible local squared error loss in a class of time-varying model averaging estimators. Under a set of regularity assumptions, the TVJMA estimator is Th-consistent. A simulation study and an empirical application highlight the merits of the proposed TVJMA estimator relative to a variety of popular estimators with constant model averaging weights and model selection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asymptotic optimality; Forecast combination; Local stationarity; Model averaging; Structural change; Time-varying model averaging","Economics; Asymptotically optimal; Combination weights; Economic time series; Institutional arrangement; Regularity assumption; Simulation studies; Squared error loss; Time-varying models; Mathematical techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087420380

As such, an integrated framework of matching and routing models have been developed. A routing strategy is established to estimate for distances that couriers need to travel for picking up and delivering packages. A matching model is developed to assign crowd-shipping customers (i.e. senders) to couriers and to maximize the CS platform providers’ benefits. Four different schemes of pricing and compensation are developed and evaluated. CS firms are noticed to have the highest profits when apply the ‘individual’ pricing and compensation schemes. The platform provider's profits are found more sensitive with the increase of willingness to pay (WTP) than the rise of expected to-be-paid (ETP). The insights are helpful for CS firms to attract and retain customers and couriers in the system, by setting up optimal prices and optimal compensations based on demand and supply levels as well as the firms’ expected profits and platform-users’ presuming surplus. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compensation scheme; Crowd-shipping; Demand and supply.; Matching; Pricing scheme; Routing","demand analysis; policy implementation; pricing policy; profitability; shipping; strategic approach; transportation policy; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103736854

Blight affects people's lives in many ways, including economically, socially, psychologically, and physically. The phenomenon comprises many factors, including making appropriate identification and eradication decisions that are challenging to analyze and structure. This study took a constructivist stance and sought to develop a new approach to urban blight to complement the existing literature. The methodology combined cognitive mapping techniques applied in decision conferences, and the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory technique based on the multiple-criteria decision analysis approach. This integrated approach facilitated the development of a multi-criteria model that identifies proactive anti-blight measures in a more complete, transparent way. This dual methodology enables incorporating objective and subjective elements, and field specialists’ knowledge and experiences, thereby reducing important decision criteria omissions. Additionally, this approach generates a transparent visualization of relationships among criteria. Identified blight determinants can be used to prevent blight, and improve the quality of life in the affected areas. These strategies were carefully analyzed by two independent experts from the Direção Geral do Território (General Directorate of the Territory of Portugal).

Because retailers are unaware of the third party, the production process becomes obscure and cannot be tracked. In this paper, we present an empirical study of the factors that can lead suppliers to engage in unauthorized subcontracting. We use data provided by a global supply chain manager with more than 30,000 orders, of which 36% were subcontracted without authorization. We find that the frequency of unauthorized subcontracting across factories has a pronounced bimodal distribution. Moreover, the degree of unauthorized subcontracting in the past is highly related to the probability of engaging in unauthorized subcontracting in the future, which suggests that factories behave as if they choose a strategic level of unauthorized subcontracting. At the order level, we find that state dependence (i.e., the status of an order carrying over to the next one) and price pressure are the key drivers of unauthorized subcontracting. Buyer reputation and lead time also play a role. Finally, we show that unauthorized subcontracting can be predicted correctly for more than 80% of the orders in out-of-sample tests and for about 70% of suppliers. This indicates that retailers can use business analytics to predict unauthorized subcontracting and help prevent it. © 2020 INFORMS","Compliance; Empirical operations management; Social responsibility; Supply chain management; Sustainability; Unauthorized subcontracting","Clothes; Supply chains; Apparel industry; Apparel supply chains; Bimodal distribution; Business analytics; Empirical studies; Global supply chain; Production process; State dependence; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101257309

Recent work on sectoral systems of innovation and in the evolutionary economics literature suggests that successful latecomers can move into new technological or industrial domains. They specialise in domains that present more frequent windows of opportunity, shorter technological cycles, flatter learning curves and easier access to relevant knowledge than others. This study investigates the role and significance of two hitherto neglected dimensions of technological regimes that might influence technological catch-up, namely, the degree of complexity and variety of an industry's knowledge base. The impact of technological variety and complexity on catch-up dynamics is tested in three industries – upstream oil/gas, wind power and solar energy – over the period from 1980 to 2016. First, we find that increased knowledge base complexity and related (as opposed to unrelated) variety play a substantial role by hindering the latecomers’ attempts to catch up with technological leaders within each industry. Second, we confirm that other dimensions of technological regime are relevant. Specifically, we find that the length of the technological cycle is important, although a nuanced picture emerges regarding the direction of its impact on catch-up when results are compared across the three industries. These results offer new insights into the technologies and industries in which latecomer countries can specialise in order to develop their innovation capacity. © 2020","Catch-Up; Complexity; Sectoral Systems; Technological Regimes; Variety","Economics; Knowledge based systems; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Degree of complexity; Evolutionary Economics; Innovation capacity; Learning curves; Technological catch-up; Technological regime; Technology cycle; Three industries; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098956192

We first develop a formal model to generate predictions about how a platform will respond. We then empirically test it, leveraging a historical setting: TV station entry into local U.S. newspaper markets from 1945 to 1963. A notable feature of this setting is a quasi-natural experiment: the staggered geographic and temporal rollout of TV stations that was temporarily halted during the Korean War. We find that platform firms indeed take their customers' homing tendencies into account in their responses to competition: after a TV station enters the newspaper market, newspaper firms with more single-homing consumers had lower subscription prices, circulations, and advertising rates. Managerial summary: The theoretical and empirical results in our paper suggest that platform firms operating in multi-sided market settings need to consider their customers' single-homing and multi-homing tendencies.

Here we provide a comprehensive literature review to examine how GBI affects FWEN in urban centers, an area which is currently understudied. In order to do this, we undertake a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analytic approach and topic modelling. Based on our synthesis, we develop a conceptual framework of the key links between urban GBI and FWEN and the direction and magnitude of the relationship. We found that GBIs can benefit food supply, energy saving, and climate change mitigation but at a price of food safety and water contamination. Well-designed urban construction can help curb the negative effects. Therefore, we need to make deliberate and integrative policy to link GBI with each element in urban FWEN. Moreover, the focus of studies on GBIFWEN links is also heterogeneous across cities: urban agriculture and food security are priorities in cities located in Africa and Asia as well as in lower income and larger cities (but not metropolitan areas), while the cooling effect of green space has been a focus for cities of middle or high income. Finally, current research focuses on isolated analysis, lacking integrated studies needed for decision making supporting tools. While isolated analyses lead to connectivity failures and can result in adverse impacts, integrated analyses can identify interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales, which can increase resource efficiency and minimize environmental degradation. Therefore, our key findings point out the importance of linking the effects of GBI on each component of FWEN in both research and policy making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","FWE nexus framework; Green infrastructure; Nature-based solutions; Urban agriculture; Urban nexus; Urban sustainability","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Decision making; Energy conservation; Enterprise resource management; Food supply; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Climate change mitigation; Conceptual frameworks; Environmental resources; Integrated analysis; Resource efficiencies; Urban agricultures; Urban construction; Water contamination; Thermal processing (foods)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099223515

Today, Chinese firms are facing the challenge of upgrading the modes of production of industries with high energy consumption and high pollution to align with green initiatives. Financial systems can be designed to intervene in modes of production to control firms’ pollution emissions, but the degree of impact and design mechanism are not clearly understood up to now. Thus, evaluating the policy impact of such transactions related to firm production is indeed an important contribution to existing knowledge about these topics. Using novel firm-level data with pollution and financial variables, we exploit the causal effect of bank loans on firms’ abatement performance by using a natural experimental of a green loan policy shock in China. The results show that green loan policy has the positive effect of pollution abatement by state-owned and private-owned firms. This paper also investigates how green loan policy may promote green production through strengthening financial constraint and decreasing fixed and intangible investments.

This study addresses this urgent need by advancing the understanding of the dynamic linkages between environmental safety and health practices of SMMEs and their impacts on economic performance. It aims to make a business case for enhanced sustainability practices by establishing a systems framework to map and analyze the interconnections between technical, environmental, social, and economic performance metrics at the operation, shopfloor, and enterprise levels. The framework systemically integrates system dynamics and sustainability assessment methods including life cycle costing, life cycle assessment, and safety and health assessment. Realization of this framework through analytical tools enables manufacturing researchers and engineering managers to gain further understanding of the linkages among economic, environmental, and social activities in manufacturing systems. It also can guide sustainability practitioners in building business cases for making strategic and tactical decisions. A case study for a metal processing manufacturer was conducted to demonstrate the application of the framework and to test several hypotheses that emerged during the research. The case study corroborated the hypothesis that manufacturing sustainability decision making is enhanced if there is a greater understanding of the dynamic interconnections among the various aspects of sustainability. Based on the results of this research, manufacturers are provided with an integrated approach to transit from implementing reactive sustainability policies to developing systemic practices that will improve worker well-being, while achieving cleaner production at lower cost. © 2020","Decision making; Small and medium sized manufacturers; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable manufacturing; System dynamics; Systems thinking","Costs; Decision making; Life cycle; Pollution control; Safety engineering; Sustainable development; Environmental safety and healths; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Metal-processing manufacturer; Small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprise; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability policy; Sustainability practices; Sustainable manufacturing; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096403688

Policy changes, trade liberalization, and privatization have come about at a rapid pace, allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade to become key components of Albania's economy. Against this backdrop, this study investigates the relationships among FDI, trade, and economic growth in Albania. Annual time-series data were obtained from the World Bank. Then, the following econometric tests were performed on the variables representing FDI inflows, exports, and GDP as proxies for FDI, trade, and economic growth: the unit root test; the unit root test with a structural break; Johansen cointegration analysis; the error correction model; and the Granger causality test. The results revealed a long-term relationship between FDI, trade, and economic growth. The Granger causality tests found unidirectional causality. Economic growth brought about exports and FDI in the short term but not vice versa. In conclusion, policymakers need to design policies that promote technology-based, export-promoting FDI to meet the needs of the economy and develop specialized sectors that are competitive in the global market. Furthermore, the salient takeaway is that the penetration of export markets should be promoted as much as the furtherance of FDI. © 2021 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

This research proposes a novel method to develop a knowledge-based recommender system from unstructured (text) data. The method is based on applying an opinion mining algorithm, extracting aspect-based sentiment score per text item, and transforming text into a structured form. An action rule mining algorithm is applied to the data table constructed from sentiment mining. The proposed application of the method is the problem of improving customer satisfaction ratings. The results obtained from the dataset of customer comments related to the repair services were evaluated with accuracy and coverage. Further, the results were incorporated into the framework of a web-based user-friendly recommender system to advise the business on how to maximally increase their profits by introducing minimal sets of changes in their service.

The vulnerability of Chinese aid to political capture has prompted speculation that it may be economically ineffective, or even harmful. We test these claims by estimating the effect of Chinese aid on subnational economic development—as measured by per-capita nighttime light emissions—and whether this effect is different at times a jurisdiction is favored politically. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we do not find that the local receipt of Chinese aid undermines economic development outcomes at either the district level or provincial level. Nor does political favoritism in the allocation of Chinese aid towards the home regions of recipient country leaders reduce its effectiveness. Our results—from 709 provinces and 5,835 districts within 47 African countries between 2001 and 2012—demonstrate that Chinese aid improves local development outcomes, regardless of whether such aid is given to jurisdictions at times they are the birth region of the country's leader. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aid effectiveness; Development finance; Economic growth; Favoritism; Foreign aid","development aid; development project; economic development; economic growth; financial system; national politics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099002540

Rail-car fleet is one of the main capital resources in the railroad industry. Hence, rail operators focus to minimize the size of rail-car fleet. We propose a novel approximation queuing model for the non-myopic dynamic rail-car fleet sizing problem with the objective of maximizing social welfare that improves the utilization of rail freight cars. A Markov decision process (MDP) is proposed to determine an optimal trade-off between the number of rail freight cars and the costs of empty rail-car allocation. A connection between an equilibrium-joining threshold and dynamic pricing policy is also studied where effective customers will join the queue based on their willingness to pay.

When parties bargain pairwisely, how do their bargaining powers influence the equilibrium procurement outsourcing structure? Academic/practical relevance: Both outsourcing structures, DS and AS are commonly observed in practice, whereas the literature has rarely answered the questions that we ask. Methodology: We adopt the generalized Nash bargaining framework to model the negotiations among the parties and derive the corresponding equilibrium outcomes under both outsourcing structures by taking into consideration the existence of a component spot market. Results: When two parties negotiate directly, we define their direct negotiation coefficient as the ratio of their exogenous bilateral relative bargaining powers. If they negotiate indirectly through a third party, we define their indirect negotiation coefficient as the quotient of their respective direct negotiation coefficients with respect to the third party. We show that when parties negotiate over both wholesale prices and quantities, the buyer s preference for DS and AS solely depends on the comparison result of the buyer s direct negotiation coefficient versus the indirect one with respect to the supplier. When the quantity is determined by the buyer and parties negotiate over wholesale prices, the equilibrium outsourcing structure hinges critically upon the magnitude of the purchasing agent s relative bargaining power over the supplier. Interestingly, the preferences of the three parties for DS and AS may be aligned with each other. We also show that it is in the best interest of the buyer to negotiate prices only. Managerial implications: Our research identifies the endogenous bargaining powers among parties that dictate the equilibrium outsourcing structure. It indicates that the buyer needs to adjust procurement outsourcing decisions accordinglywhen the bargaining powers of the buyer s upstreampartners are altered, especially when the buyer s bargaining power is sufficiently large: we analytically show that the buyer s preference is very sensitive to the relative bargaining powers of the purchasing agent and the supplier.

The main idea is to project out the common factors from the exogenous covariates of the model, and to construct instruments based on defactored covariates. For models with homogeneous slope coefficients, we propose a two-step IV estimator. In the first step, the model is estimated consistently by employing defactored covariates as instruments. In the second step, the entire model is defactored based on estimated factors extracted from the residuals of the first-step estimation, after which an IV regression is implemented using the same instruments as in step one. For models with heterogeneous slope coefficients, we propose a mean-group-type estimator, which involves the averaging of first-step IV estimates of cross-section-specific slopes. The proposed estimators do not need to seek for instrumental variables outside the model. Furthermore, these estimators are linear, and therefore computationally robust and inexpensive. Notably, they require no bias correction. We investigate the finite sample performances of the proposed estimators and associated statistical tests, and the results show that the estimators and the tests perform well even for small N and T. © 2020","Cross-sectional dependence; Dynamic panel data; Factor model; Method of moments","Economics; Mathematical techniques; Bias correction; Dynamic panel data; Error structures; Finite sample performance; Heterogeneous slopes; Homogeneous slope; Instrumental variables; Panel data models; Sampling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086591875

The study sets in the UK context and the unit of analysis is the generator connected with energy storage. An analytical method is derived to assess the impact of policy schemes for low-carbon infrastructure on energy storage. The case study of energy storage systems coupled with a Small Modular nuclear Reactor (SMR) is quantitatively investigated in three scenarios: 1. SMR-only (the baseline); 2. SMR with thermal energy storage; and 3. SMR with Lithium-ion battery. For the strike price at 100 £/MWh, the net present value for scenarios 2 and 3 reduces from 562 M£ to 379 M£ and from 376 M£ to -1144 M£, respectively, when the energy storage capacity increases from 100 MWh to 1 GWh. As the net present value reduces with increased energy storage capacity (when coupled with generation), this work shows that low-carbon incentives are, unintentionally, barriers to the development of energy storage due to: (A) current generator incentives give a favourable return on investment and energy storage would diminish it; (B) energy storage cannot participate in generator only incentives. © 2020 The Authors","Contract for difference; Energy storage; Generation integrated energy storage; Low-carbon power incentives","Carbon; Energy policy; Heat storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Small nuclear reactors; Analytical method; Current generator; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage systems; Financial performance; Net present value; Small modular nuclear reactors; Unit of analysis; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094847004

In this paper, we discuss the strategic and economic value of this technology by applying it to the value-added tax (VAT) reporting system, focusing on blockchain’s characteristic traceability. By effectively increasing financial transparency, the application of blockchain to the VAT system can prevent VAT-related fraud (e.g., underreported VAT) that can arise due to the information asymmetry that exists at different stages of the supply chain. We develop a game theoretical model that involves a retailer and two vendors in order to study the players’ strategic decisions regarding blockchain adoption and to examine the effects on social welfare. We also show how the decision to adopt blockchain depends on considerations such as adoption costs, the vendors’ VAT reporting behavior, the retailer’s profit margins, and inter-vendor competition. Furthermore, we find that under certain conditions, policymakers can increase social welfare by providing subsidies to encourage blockchain adoption.88. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Blockchain; blockchain impacts; game theoretical model; social welfare; strategic financial transparency; value-added tax; VAT","Blockchain; Game theory; Supply chains; Transparency; Different stages; Economic impacts; Game theoretical models; Information asymmetry; Inter-organizational; Reporting systems; Strategic decisions; Transaction cost; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112664745

Design/methodology/approach: A survey research design is adopted to collect primary and secondary data from 182 international firms. The complementarity (or substitutability) of three As (agile, adaptable and aligned) were analyzed in three-way and pairwise interactions; both, correlation and performance differences methods of testing the type of interactions among the system’s elements were used. Supply chain-centric and firm-centric performance metrics were used to examine the interaction types. Findings: The study did not find empirical evidence of three-way complementarity between the three As. However, this paper did find evidence of complementarity in bivariate interactions for alignment and adaptability. Moreover, in the performance difference method, the study found a substitute relationship between all pairs of As. Practical implications: The findings related to the substitutability between the three As offer managers guidance on how to allocate their limited resources to avoid unnecessary over-or under-investing in either one of the three As. Originality/value: This study helps refine prior findings related to the three As by offering evidence that firms can still achieve their performance-related goals with reduced investment commitments by taking advantage of the substitutability relationship existent between these capabilities. That is, instead of concomitantly developing all three As as past studies have suggested, managers can use the findings to determine how to prioritize their resource allocation better. Furthermore, understanding the actual interaction among the supply chain variables generally provide insights for designing the supply chain, change management in the supply chain, developing supply chain strategy and adopting best practices in the supply chain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptability; Agility; Alignment; Complementarity; Complexity; Firm performance; Supply chain; Supply-chain management; Surveys",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102170215

Although the construction industry periodically provides large amount of data, existing studies have not fully exploited such data sets, especially relating to the overall productivity of the construction industry rather than labor productivity. This paper addresses this critical knowledge gap by statistically examining and modeling the causalities between different dynamic workforce and workplace variables and the productivity of the entire construction industry. Multivariate time-series data between 2006 and 2019 were collected for the productivity of the construction industry and 11 dynamic workforce and workplace variables: job openings, job hires, turnover or job separations, total compensation, gross job gains, gross job losses, average hourly earnings, fatalities, occupational injuries and illnesses, gross domestic product, and unemployment rate. Statistically significant relationships and causalities were examined between the response variable - productivity of the construction industry - and these 11 variables. A vector autoregression (VAR) framework was developed to model the temporal variations in the productivity of the construction industry. The developed VAR model was validated by predicting the construction productivity for the 2016-2019 period an acceptable mean average percentage error of 5.13%. Based on the findings, the paper concludes that (1) all considered dynamic workforce and workplace variables, except job openings, statistically cause fluctuations in the construction productivity; (2) the new concept of gross construction productivity is justified statistically and should be implemented in the construction industry; (3) the gross construction productivity is an additional valuable information that construction companies should consider to make different insightful and well-educated industry-related decisions; (4) the health of the construction industry needs to be studied based on the productivity of the industry as a whole rather than based on labor productivity alone; and (5) the construction industry should move toward the development of a notion of gross construction productivity indicator used to measure, evaluate, and predict the performance of the entire industry. Ultimately, this paper proposes a new indicator or index for gross construction productivity. The outcomes of this paper add to the body of knowledge by providing a better understanding of the impact of different dynamic workforce and workplace variables on the construction productivity and by offering a new concept called gross construction productivity. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Accident prevention; Construction industry; Employment; Occupational risks; Personnel; Regression analysis; Value engineering; Construction companies; Construction productivity; Gross domestic products; Labor productivity; Multivariate time series; Occupational injury; Temporal variation; Vector autoregressions; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092218201

High FIO can subject a firm to heightened regulatory scrutiny and compliance, increasing its political dependence. Drawing on resource dependence theory, we argue that firms can manage the political dependence that arises from FIO by engaging in corporate political spending (CPS). We derive two moderating conditions from our theoretical argument, positing that the strength of the positive relationship between FIO and CPS hinges on the intensity of a firm's government contracting and on the political sensitivity of the industry. Our study advances strategic ownership research by highlighting that U.S. firms may need to manage the potential liabilities associated with FIO through nonmarket strategy. Managerial Summary: Research suggests that firms can reap many benefits from equity investments made by foreign institutional investors. However, such investments may also have potential downsides. We posit that high levels of FIO may subject a firm to increased political and regulatory scrutiny, and that firms can manage this increased exposure to government by engaging in corporate political activities that allow them to monitor and influence the political landscape. To explore this question, we analyzed a large sample of publicly traded U.S. firms and find empirical support for our arguments. Our study highlights an unintended “liability” of FIO that firm executives should be aware of and has practical implications for how firms manage their investors and allocate resources between market and nonmarket strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","corporate political spending; foreign institutional ownership; nonmarket strategy; political dependence; resource dependence theory","Commerce; Investments; Regulatory compliance; Institutional investors; Institutional ownerships; Non-market strategy; Political activity; Political sensitivities; Potential liability; Resource dependences; Theoretical arguments; Product liability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088859400

Several factors can be considered in the estimation, for example, surgeon, surgeon experience, case type, case start time, etc. Some of these factors are correlated, and this correlation needs to be considered in the prediction model in order to have an accurate estimation. Extensive research exists that identifies the preferred estimation methods for cases that occur frequently. However, in practice, there are many procedure types with limited historical data, which makes it hard to use common statistical methods (such as regression) that rely on a large number of data points. Moreover, only point estimates are typically provided. In this research, kernel density estimation (KDE) is implemented as an estimator for the probability distribution of surgery duration, and a comparison against lognormal and Gaussian mixture models is reported, showing the efficiency of the KDE. In addition, an improvement procedure for the KDE that further enables the algorithm to outperform other methods is proposed. Based on the analysis, KDE can be recommended as an alternative estimator of surgical duration for cases with low volume (or limited historical data). © 2018 The Authors.

One important factor that has been neglected so far is the adoption timing. The question of whether early OHSAS 18001 adopters achieve better financial performance and operational performance than do late adopters (or vice versa) remains unanswered. We develop hypotheses and then analyze the secondary longitudinal data of listed Chinese manufacturing firms by employing a rigorous event study approach and performing regressions. The results indicate that early adopters enjoy significantly greater performance gains than do late adopters and this can be explained by institutional theory. We find that early adopters of OHSAS 18001 certification motivated by normative pressure realize additional financial performance from the second year to the fourth year after adoption, and the early adopter advantages of improved labor productivity can at least last in the medium term, but late adopters motivated by coercive and mimetic pressure only benefit in the preparation year. Moreover, early adoption is more favorable to firms with high labor intensity and low internationalization level. Thus, this study extends research in understanding the effects of OHSAS 18001 on firm performance and suggest new insights to the implementation of occupational health and safety practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adoption timing; Event study; Institutional theory; OHSAS 18001","Industrial hygiene; Productivity; Timing circuits; Financial performance; Institutional theory; Labor productivity; Longitudinal data; Manufacturing firms; Normative pressures; Occupational health and safety; Operational performance; Occupational risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088626723

The consumer-centric design (putting the consumers at the centre of the content development and production) focuses on ways in which businesses can design customized services and products which accurately reflect consumer preferences. We propose a new framework which allows to use data science to optimize content-generation in entertainment and test this framework for the motion picture industry. We use the natural language processing methodology combined with econometric analysis to explore whether and to what extent emotions shape consumer preferences for media and entertainment content, which, in turn, affect revenue streams. By analyzing 6,174 movie scripts, we generate the emotional trajectory of each motion picture. We then combine the obtained mappings into clusters which represent groupings of consumer emotional journeys. These clusters are then plugged into an econometric model to predict overall success parameters of the movies including box office revenues, viewer satisfaction levels (captured by IMDb ratings), awards, as well as the number of viewers’ and critics’ reviews. We find that emotional arcs in movies can be partitioned into 6 basic shapes. The highest box offices are associated with the Man in a Hole shape which is characterized by an emotional fall followed by an emotional rise. This U-shaped emotional arc results in financially successful movies irrespective of genre and production budget. Implications of this analysis for generating on-demand content and improving productivity in entertainment industries are discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).

The significant role of manufacturing strategy deployment is selecting the production system best suited for a manufacturing firm. The appropriately chosen production system (strategic process choice) facilitates a firm to produce “order winning” outputs and provides a production competence to achieve business success. This research presents a novel framework to determine the compatible production system for a manufacturing firm. An integrated three-stage Delphi-MCDM-Bayesian Network (BN) framework has been proposed. The process choice criteria (PCC) considered for deciding production systems are identified through an in-depth literature review and then validated by experts through a Delphi method in the first stage. It resulted in the determination of twenty-six PCC. In the second stage, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) method is adopted to determine each criterion's relative importance for a firm. The relative weights obtained are then used as input for the machine learning (ML) technique- Bayesian network (BN) in the third stage. The BN model quantifies the selection probability of production systems. The proposed Delphi-MCDM-BN framework is demonstrated using a real-life case of a “hydraulic and pneumatic valve” manufacturing firm to select a suitable production system. The three-stage framework is a novel contribution to the literature, which can be used by researchers, practitioners, and manufacturing strategists to choose an appropriate production system for any manufacturing firm. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian network; Delphi; Manufacturing strategy; Production competence; Production systems; Voting AHP","Barium compounds; Decision making; Industrial research; Knowledge based systems; Manufacture; Bayesia n networks; Delphi; Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing strategy; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Production competence; Production system; Voting AHP; Bayesian networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114948077

The pharmacy department in healthcare facilities is responsible for acquisition, distribution and dispensing of medication to patients that involves a series of network process. This process can be categorized into two main subprocesses: i) pharmacy store and ii) patient services (i.e., ambulatory and inpatient pharmacy). The objective of this study was to investigate the relative efficiency level of the two subprocesses of pharmacy services in Malaysia's public hospitals. We used a nonconvex metafrontier technology to estimate technical efficiency of hospital pharmacies between specialist and nonspecialist hospital categories under the dynamic network data envelopment analysis (DNDEA) framework. For overall efficiency, both specialist and nonspecialist categories had similar mean efficiency scores. However, when measuring the efficiency level according to pharmacy store and patient services separately, the nonspecialist category had a higher mean efficiency score in pharmacy store, whereas for patient service efficiency, both categories had similar results. The patient service efficiency level was lower consistently over time, suggesting that the overall inefficiency of hospital pharmacy is greatly influenced by the inefficiency of the patient service. This suggests that systematic improvements in patient service efficiency should be a higher priority than pharmacy store efficiency to further increase the overall efficiency level. We believe that our findings will provide valuable information to policymakers towards achieving an efficient public healthcare service. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic network data envelopment analysis; Hospital pharmacy services; Nonconvex metafrontier analysis","data envelopment analysis; health services; hospital sector; model; public health; technical efficiency; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108971461

The main aim of this study was to analyse the impact of lockdown (imposed in March and continued in April 2020) on the existing air quality in three megacities of India (Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata) by assessing the trends of PM10 and NO2 concentrations. A comparison of the percentage reduction in concentrations of lockdown period with respect to same period in year 2019 and pre-lockdown period (February 14–March 24) was made. It was observed from the study that an overall decrease of pollutant concentrations was in the ranges of 30–60% and 52–80% of PM10 and NO2, respectively, in the three cities during lockdown in comparison with previous year and pre-lockdown period. The overall decrease in concentrations of pollutants at urban sites was greater than the background sites. Highest decline in concentrations of PM10 were observed in Kolkata city, followed by Mumbai and Delhi, while decline in NO2 was highest in Mumbai.

Existing methodologies are often costly and unscalable. Furthermore, understanding how elements of service quality contribute to the performance of service providers continues to be a concern in the service industry. In this paper, we address these challenges in the restaurant sector, a vital component of the service industry. Academic/ practical relevance: Our work provides a scalable methodology for measuring the quality of service providers using the vast amount of text in social media. The quality metrics proposed are associated with economic outcomes for restaurants and can help predict future restaurant performance. Methodology: We use text present in online reviews on Yelp.com to identify and extract service dimensions using nonnegative matrix factorization for a large set of restaurants located in a major city in the United States. We subsequently validate these service dimensions as proxies for service quality using external data sources and a series of laboratory experiments. Finally, we use econometrics to test the relationship between these dimensions and restaurant survival as additional validation. Results: We find that our proposed service quality dimensions are scalable, match industry standards, and are correctly identified by subjects in a controlled setting. Furthermore, we show that specific service dimensions are significantly correlated with the survival of merchants, even after controlling for competition and other factors. Managerial implications: This work has implications for the strategic use of text analytics in the context of service operations, where an increasingly large text corpus is available. We discuss the benefits of this work for service providers and platforms, such as Yelp and OpenTable. © 2020 INFORMS","Business survival; Econometrics; Machine learning; Service quality; Text analysis; Word of mouth","Economics; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Quality control; Scalability; Statistics; Business survival; Performance; Problem description; Quality metrices; Quality-of-service; Service industries; Service provider; Service Quality; Social media; Text-mining; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111339091

The study used an online survey of 163 Chinese customers and a pride-inducing methodology to investigate how pride in purchasing pro-environmental technology could lead to positive spillovers. A Partial Least Squares approach to Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the results. Feelings of pride elicited by the intentions to purchase the novel technology positively affect subsequent behaviours of reducing energy consumption by other means (same domain), as well as recycling and reusing materials (different domain). Pride appeals can be leveraged by social businesses as by definition they focus on the social good and, according to our findings, pride-inducing messages enhance the impacts of the pro-environmental technology adoption. Such spillovers can be beneficial to society, thus allowing social businesses to satisfy social and financial goals at the same time. © 2021","Conservation behaviours; Pride; Pro-environmental technology adoption; Social business spillovers","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hazardous materials spills; Least squares approximations; Sales; Solar power generation; Business applications; CO$-2$/ emission; Conservation behavior; Pride; Pro-environmental technology adoption; Social business; Social business spillover; Solar photovoltaics; Spill over; Technology adoption; Environmental technology; business development; business service; energy efficiency; photovoltaic system; solar power; spillover effect; technology adoption; thermal power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111299337

The objective of this research was to explore the diffusion of CED schemes for devices in Europe, and the factors that favour or hamper their utilization. Methods: We conducted structured interviews with 25 decision-makers from 22 European countries to explore the characteristics of existing CED programmes for devices, and how decision makers perceived 13 pre-identified challenges associated with initiating and operating CED schemes for devices. We also collected data on individual schemes that were either initiated or still ongoing in the last 5 years. Results: We identified seven countries with CED programmes for devices and 78 ongoing schemes. The characteristics of CED programmes varied across countries, including eligibility criteria, roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, funding arrangements, and type of decisions being contemplated at the outset of each scheme. We observed a high variability in how decision makers perceived CED-related challenges possibly reflecting country-specific arrangements and different experiences with CED. One general finding across all countries was that relatively little attention was paid to the evaluation of schemes, both during and at their completion. Conclusions: CED programmes for devices with different characteristics exist in Europe. Decision-makers’ perceptions differ on the challenges associated with these schemes. More exchange of knowledge and experience will help decision makers anticipate the likely challenges in CED schemes for devices, and to learn from good practices existing elsewhere. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adoption and reimbursement of medical devices; Coverage with evidence development; European HTA policies; Medical devices; Value of information","Article; clinical practice; clinical protocol; content analysis; controlled study; coverage with evidence development; decision making; eligibility criteria; Europe; funding; health insurance; human; Likert scale; narrative; national health insurance; reimbursement; structured interview; biomedical technology assessment; cost benefit analysis; Europe; longitudinal study; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Europe; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Technology Assessment, Biomedical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107816083

This paper develops a new nonparametric methodology for performance evaluation of organizations (or decision-making units, DMUs) considering carbon emission permit trading. Explicit production axioms are discussed, and a new production technology considering carbon emission permit trading is proposed. Models based on the new production technology are established for evaluating the carbon emission reduction potential and performance of the DMUs. Comparing the proposed models with previous ones, the adoption of carbon emission permit trading increases the potentials of DMUs to reduce carbon dioxide emission and improve inputs and outputs. In addition, a proper increase of the carbon emission permit trading price can increase the potential of DMUs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed approach contributes to the literature by explicitly explaining how adopting carbon emission permit trading affects production technology. A numeral example illustrates the proposed approach while the usefulness and practicality of the models are explained by applying them to China's thermal power industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Abatement potential; Carbon emission permit trading; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency evaluation; Production technology","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Decision making; Emission control; Global warming; Abatement potentials; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission permit trading; Carbon emission permits; Data envelopment; Decision making unit; Efficiency evaluation; New production technologies; Performances evaluation; Production technology; Data envelopment analysis; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental technology; incentive; performance assessment; price dynamics; China; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111012699

By integrating multiple theories of travel decision-making and UGC distribution, this study develops and validates an agent-based model to inform DMOs of potential causal mechanisms of how individual tourists’ UGC behavioral features shape international arrival distribution via the social media channels of review sites (RSs) and social networking sites (SNSs). Simulated experiments with the model decompose and assess the complex UGC behavioral effects, which further suggest context-based favorable UGC distribution statuses for DMOs’ strategic UGC marketing. The model developed following a rigid procedure offers a promising UGC research approach toward the combination of restrictive causal conceptualization and real-life replicability.

It also analyzes the changing trend and room for growth of the green growth level of oil and gas resource-based cities. The results show that: (1) Using the combined SBM and ML methods can scientifically evaluate the green growth efficiency of China's oil and gas resource-based cities; (2) The green growth level of China's oil and gas resource-based cities generally rose first in 2010–2017 and then showed the declining wave momentum. The green growth efficiency has a lot of room for improvement; (3) The green technology progress index (TC) shows a U-shaped changing trend, and however, the TC is greater than 0.7 and approaching to 1 between 2011 and 2017, indicating that green technology progress has a promoting effect on green growth efficiency; (4) Indicating green technological progress is the main factor for improving the green growth efficiency of oil and gas resource-based cities.

Using data fromTaskRabbit, an expanding marketplace for domestic tasks at the time of our study, we show that growth varies considerably across cities. To disentangle the potential drivers of growth, we look separately at demand and supply imbalances, network effects, and geographic heterogeneity. First, we find that supply is highly elastic: in periods when demand doubles, sellers perform almost twice as many tasks, prices hardly increase, and the probability of requested tasks being matched falls only slightly. The first result implies that in markets where supply can accommodate demand fluctuations, growth relies on attracting buyers at a faster rate than sellers. Second and perhaps most surprisingly, we find no evidence of network effects in matching: doubling the number of buyers and sellers only doubles the number of matches. Third, we show that the cities where market fundamentals promote efficient matching of buyers and sellers are also those that are the fastest growing. This heterogeneity in matching efficiency is related to two measures of market thickness: geographic density (buyers and sellers living close together) and level of task standardization (buyers requesting homogeneous tasks). Our results have two main implications for peer-to-peer markets in which network effects are limited by the local and time-sensitive nature of the services exchanged. First, marketplace growth largely depends on strategic geographic expansion. Second, a competitive rather than winner-take-all equilibrium may arise in the long run. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Recent studies emphasise the multiplicity of project value in various project settings as perceived by different project actors. Drawing on previous work on project value and project front-end, this study expands on the idea of multiplicity of project value in the early project definition phase. To this end, the study draws from empirical data on infrastructure projects provision, including semi-structured interviews with a set of highly experienced and senior level informants with extensive knowledge and familiarity of infrastructure project planning and front-end decision making. The study is bounded with a focus on London, UK as an example of a complex, highly established global city with a great reliance on its infrastructure and a well-established projects ecology. Through inductive qualitative data analysis the study explores the role of infrastructure projects as solutions to policy problems, the multiple and complex nature of value in project definition and identifies three value levels, which are instrumental for project definition: local value, sector value and user value.

Social comparison features, such as leaderboards, individual scores, achievement badges and level maps, are commonly used in online games to enforce the social interaction of players. However, one of the biggest challenges that the social game industry is currently facing is the ability to increase user enjoyment, and keep its players engaged in the games. To probe more deeply into whether and how players’ continuance intention is influenced by social comparison processes, we combine two theoretical lenses: social comparison theory and self-efficacy theory.

Carbon pricing is an effective measure for reducing carbon emissions, but its distributional effects may exacerbate inequity among different rural and urban households. As a leading carbon pricing pilot area in China, Guangdong Province is the subject area of this paper. By using the environmentally extended input-output model and calculating the Suits index, this study aims to compare the carbon price payments of ten income-level households in Guangdong Province in 2012 and 2017. The results indicate that higher-income households need to pay more for carbon emissions. Total carbon pricing in Guangdong is slightly progressive, and the progressivity increased from 2012 to 2017. Thus, the implementation of carbon pricing may not intensify the inequality between urban and rural areas and between different income groups. Only carbon pricing on residential energy consumption is regressive, which could be compensated by revenue recycling policies. The findings of this study contribute by offering a positive theoretical basis for China's future policies on carbon pricing such as carbon taxes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pricing; Guangdong province; Input-output analysis","Climate change; Costs; Economics; Energy utilization; Rural areas; Carbon emissions; Carbon pricing; Case-studies; Chinese Government; Climate change mitigation; Government IS; Guangdong Province; Income inequality; Input/Output analysis; Mitigation policies; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102408263

Because third-party firms can also strategically contribute to OSS and compete in the services market, the nature of competition between OSS constituents and proprietary software firms can be complex. Moreover, their incentives are likely influenced by the licensing schemes that govern OSS. We study a three-player game and examine how open-source licensing affects competition among an open-source originator, an open-source contributor, and a proprietor competing in an enterprise software market. In this regard, we examine (1) how quality investments and prices are endogenously determined in equilibrium, (2) how license restrictiveness impacts equilibrium investments and the quality of offerings, and (3) how license restrictiveness affects consumer surplus and social welfare. Although some in the open-source community often advocate restrictive licenses such as theGNUGeneral Public License because it is not always in the best interest of the originator for the contributor to invest greater development effort, such licensing can actually be detrimental to both consumer surplus and social welfare when it exacerbates this incentive conflict. We find such an outcome in markets characterized by software providers with similar development capabilities yet cast in favor of the proprietor. In contrast, when these capabilities either become more dispersed or remain similar but tilt in favor of open source, a more restrictive license instead encourages greater effort from the OSS contributor, leads to higher OSS quality, and provides a larger societal benefit. © 2020 INFORMS.","Co-creation; Collaborative development; Licensing; Open-source software; Product quality; Software competition; Software services market; Strategic contributions to open-source software","Commerce; Competition; Enterprise software; Game theory; Investments; Open systems; Service industry; Business models; Consumer surplus; Open source communities; Proprietary software; Quality investments; Social welfare; Societal benefits; Third parties; Open source software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106551183

The integrated and structured data set is used to conduct innovative analysis that identifies the sources of adulteration risks in China's food SCs and contrasts them with the current test resource allocations of the CFDA. The analysis highlights multiple strategic insights. Particularly, it suggests potential gaps in the current CFDA testing allocation by SC location, which is heavily focused on retail and supermarkets. Instead, the analysis indicates that high-risk parts of the SC, such as wholesale and wet markets, are undersampled. Additionally, the paper highlights the impact that SC analytics could have on policy-level operational decision making to regulate food SCs and manage food safety.

We present an integrated approach to assess the environmental benefits and economic implications of plastic waste management by interfacing collection and sorting with process-based treatment models for energy recovery, fuel recovery and mechanical recycling. Three composite treatment scenarios are analyzed under various techno-economic contexts to understand the key drivers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions/savings and economic viability. At current collection volumes, both net GHG savings and net annual revenue are unfavorable. Scaling collection rates from the current level to a hypothetical 100% exposes inefficiencies beyond the collection bottleneck and results in net GHG emissions. We find that a business-as-usual increase in collection volume alone would be insufficient to offset GHG emissions and is uneconomical. We quantify the potential found in improving waste-to-energy efficiencies, developing high-yield plastics-to-fuel pathways and incorporating design for recycling considerations. From an economic standpoint, external market factors such as sale price of electricity, fuels and virgin resins are critical to financial viability of treatment processes. This analysis also allows us to appropriately assess the magnitude of investment and type of policy efforts needed to address the problem. To effectively collect and treat 100% of all U.S. postconsumer plastic waste, an upfront investment of 17–21 Billion USD is estimated. This approach underscores the importance of a systems perspective that acknowledges the complexity of the postconsumer plastic waste stream to sustainably achieve plastic waste management objectives. © 2020",,"Economics; Elastomers; Environmental management; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Waste treatment; Design for recycling; Economic implications; Economic standpoints; Environmental benefits; Financial viability; Integrated approach; Management objectives; Mechanical recycling; Plastic recycling; carbon emission; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; investment; plastic waste; waste management; waste treatment; Article; consumer; controlled study; electricity; environmental policy; feasibility study; government; greenhouse gas; intervention study; life cycle stage; limit of quantitation; plastic waste; postconsumer plastic waste; pyrolysis; scoring system; United States; waste management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099683327

This article analyzes the local community perception in the Mar Menor area about the causes, consequences and possible solutions to current problems, especially the eutrophic crisis in the Mar Menor lagoon. For this research, a survey based on a questionnaire was conducted in 2017 and answered by 498 people. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis. Results showed significant differences among the groups of respondents, according to their profession and main economic activity, but the results also point to an important consensus in the group of respondents. It is worth noting that the broad consensus was that agricultural activities are the main causes of the entry of nutrients into the lagoon, and the respondents indicated that the priority should be given to measures to reduce nutrient inputs. This consensus, which is very different from the results obtained in previous studies, represents a very recent change of perception in relation to the role of agriculture in the Mar Menor. However, the broad consensus in the diagnosis of the current problem is not reflected in the varying opinions regarding the possible solutions or management options. Survey responses regarding solutions varied greatly across groups: There were important differences between (a) the respondents’ perceptions of the best solutions, and (b) the main management practices undertaken by the public administration at this point. This finding highlights a potential conflict that should be considered in any decision-making processes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agrarian pollution; Coastal lagoon; Social perceptions; Social–ecological system; Sustainability","administrative framework; decision making; economic activity; environmental degradation; management practice; perception; principal component analysis; questionnaire survey; socioeconomic impact; Mar Menor; Murcia [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082946180

In this paper, a sustainable retrofit decision-making model is developed to uncover the optimal set of retrofit solutions according to local climatic conditions, building features, and retrofit costs. Net present value (NPV), a common method for analyzing the feasibility of a building retrofit solution, is used to determine the optimal retrofit solution of existing high-rise residential buildings in a temperate zone and hot summer-cold winter zone, involving prototypical 1990s apartments of 116 and 53 m2 floor areas respectively. This reveals that the lighting system, wall insulation, and upgraded window glazing are essential optimal retrofit measures for the temperate zone, whereas the heating system and shading devices are also essential for the hot summer-cold winter zone. The results indicate that the optimal NPV can be obtained by pursuing a 40% energy saving, as it can result in energy saving of up to 50 kWh/m2/year and 95 kWh/m2/year at an average retrofit cost of approximately USD 1.30 and 3.20 m2/year in the temperate and hot summer-cold winter zones respectively. The sensitivities associated with the most influential optimal NPV and energy savings input parameters are critically analyzed; these can be used by decision-makers to determine the risks and uncertainties related to various cost-effective retrofit measures. The model can help in devising the most suitable sustainable retrofit measures for existing buildings commensurate with the energy reduction targets of policy and decision-makers in the two climate zones. It is also amenable to being adapted for other climatic zones to identify the most appropriate sustainable building retrofit for particular local climatic conditions and building characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy-cost model; High-rise residential building; Hot summer-cold winter zone; Optimization; Sustainable building retrofitting; Temperate zone","Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Retrofitting; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Uncertainty analysis; Building characteristics; Climatic conditions; Decision making models; High rise residential building; Reduce energy consumption; Retrofit solutions; Risks and uncertainties; Sustainable building; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092518576

The fog computing paradigm extends cloud computing at the edge and middle-tier locations of the network, providing response times an order of magnitude smaller than those that can be achieved by the current 'client-to-cloud' network model. Here, we address the challenges of provisioning heavily stateful LLA in the setting where fog infrastructure consists of third-party computing resources, i.e., cloudlets, that come in the form of 'data centres in the box'. We introduce FogSpot, a charging mechanism for on-path, on-demand, application provisioning. In FogSpot, cloudlets offer their resources in the form of Virtual Machines (VMs) via markets, collocated with the cloudlets, that interact with forwarded users' application requests for VMs in real time. FogSpot associates each cloudlet with a price based on applications' demand. The proposed mechanism's design takes into account the characteristics of cloudlets' resources, such as their limited elasticity, and LLAs' attributes, like their expected QoS gain and engagement duration. Lastly, FogSpot guarantees the end users' requests truthfulness while focusing in maximising either each cloudlet's revenue or resource utilisation. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","application provisioning; decentralised cloud applications; Edge/Fog computing; network economics; pricing; quality of service","Costs; Economics; Fog; Fog computing; Application provisioning; Cloud applications; Datacenter; Decentralised; Decentralized cloud application; Edge/fog computing; Low latency; Network economics; Quality-of-service; Spot pricing; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121757728

Drawing on social practice theory, this paper examines changes in staff air travel behaviour observed in a New Zealand government agency, following the nationwide lockdown in 2020. Integrating air travel data, a staff wellbeing survey and 18 interviews, the research reveals fundamental differences in the meaning of face-to-face versus online meetings, the inseparable nature of productivity and personal wellbeing, and the change processes that staff noted when faced with a (temporary) new reality of restricted mobility.

To do so, this paper presents a framework for modeling hotel demand that incorporates machine learning techniques. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical forecasting is conducted by introducing a segmented machine learning approach of leveraging hierarchical clustering tied to machine learning and deep learning techniques. These features allow the model to yield more precise estimates. This study evaluates an extensive range of social media–derived words with the most significant probability of gradually establishing an understanding of an optimal outcome. Analyzes were performed on a major hotel chain in an urban market setting within the USA. Findings: The findings indicate that while traditional methods, being the naïve approach and ARIMA models, struggled with forecasting accuracy, segmented boosting methods (XGBoost) leveraging social media predict hotel occupancy with greater precision for all examined time horizons. Additionally, the segmented learning approach improved the forecasts’ stability and robustness while mitigating common overfitting issues within a highly dimensional data set. Research limitations/implications: Incorporating social media into a segmented learning framework can augment the current generation of forecasting methods’ accuracy. Moreover, the segmented learning approach mitigates the negative effects of market shifts (e.g. COVID-19) that can reduce in-production forecasts’ life-cycles. The ability to be more robust to market deviations will allow hospitality firms to minimize development time.

Academic/practical relevance: Many retailers have recently sought to tighten their return policy by decreasing the return period window. We investigate the impact of such a policy change on sales, returns, and profitability for a multichannel retailer. Methodology: We conduct a multimethodology research in which we (1) develop theoretical predictions using an analytical model, (2) empirically test analytical predictions using data from a jewelry retailer that changed its return policy from 100 days to 60 days, and (3) extend the empirical analysis to estimate the impact of the policy change on profitability. Results: We find that the return period policy change does not have any statistically significant effect on sales and return rates for online stores, whereas it decreases sales by 8%, return rate by 2.7 percentage points, and profit by 7.3% per brick-and-mortar store, corresponding to a 2.7% decrease in annual sales for the retailer. The two likely explanations for the insignificant effect for online stores are (1) the low proportion of online customers affected by the policy change and (2) the return displacement effect—in response to the policy change, some affected customers likely accelerate their product evaluation to return within the restrictive policy period. Our analysis also demonstrates that a return period policy change may increase retail profitability if a majority of retail stores operates under high sales volume and high return rates. Managerial implications: Our study suggests that managers of multichannel retailers that consider a change in their return period policies should carefully assess their operational structures and evaluate consumer return behavior at each channel, particularly over the time window between the proposed policy period and the existing policy period.

Gender issues arise in daily interactions where employees may not seek knowledge from others when they need it, even if they know who possesses the knowledge, because they may find the knowledge holder difficult to access. In this research, drawing upon social role theory, it is proposed that knowledge accessibility varies across four different types of gender groups (women seeking knowledge from women, women seeking knowledge from men, men seeking knowledge from men, and men seeking knowledge from women). The hypotheses were tested with data collected from an engineering organization. Based on 530 knowledge-seeking interactions provided from 312 engineers, it is found that, in general, women perceived higher levels of knowledge accessibility than men. Knowledge accessibility represents the time and effort that individuals spend in the process of knowledge seeking. Moreover, the highest perceived accessibility was when women sought knowledge from other women; in contrast, the lowest perceived accessibility was when men sought knowledge from women. The theoretical and managerial implications, especially career-related implications for female professionals in a male-dominated industry, are discussed. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Gender; Gender group; Knowledge accessibility; Knowledge seeking; Social role theory","Engineering; Management; Engineering companies; Engineering organizations; Gender issues; Knowledge accessibilities; Managerial implications; Social roles; Professional aspects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092301167

Previous research shows contradictory results-while some studies find a positive effect of R&D on firm performance, some find that firms investing in R&D do not perform significantly better, in some cases, even perform worse than their noninvesting counterparts. We claim that the effects of R&D on performance are often misspecified. Indeed, innovation capabilities will probably simultaneously influence the decision to invest in R&D and also R&D's expected benefits. We apply endogenous switching regression to tackle the issue of selection and censored data, and the results we observe are sharp: Firms investing in R&D would have had less growth and less relative profitability if they had not done so. Interestingly, firms that did not invest in R&D would not have benefited had they done so. We interpret this as evidence that firms need to have sufficiently developed management capabilities to be able to convert R&D investments into tangible results, and that not all firms are well positioned to benefit from R&D investment. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Although previous literature and actual practices confirmed the successful implementation of sustainability practices through supply chain collaborations, it is not clear how collaborating partners can support financial and environmental performance, and hence strengthen the partnership performance in the global supply chains. To address this practice-based research question, we test the theoretical underpinning of suppliers and logistics partners in relation to required skills selection. We capture the depth of interdependencies in collaborations for routine operations and sustainability, through empirical evidence. We used case study observations from three global companies to develop a conceptual model and also conducted a questionnaire survey to test the conceptual model. The results of case analysis confirmed two dimensions of collaborations that could strengthen relationship; namely, partners’ selection and sustainability team formation. Data analysis strongly support business collaborations having careful choice of supply chain partners and logistics operators who are ready to maintain green operations with transparent information sharing. Results of this study also inform managers about the importance of commitment from collaborating partners to achieve sustainability in their global supply chains.

In so doing, we employed a time-varying structural vector autoregression framework which accounts for time variations (in coefficients as well as in the variance–covariance matrix of innovations) on the data from July 2000 to December 2016. Our key findings suggested that the easing of monetary and credit conditions, stable and stronger currency and economic growth have played a significant and positive role in the development of the stock market in Vietnam. Inflation shocks did have a negative impact which implied that in policy setting the price stability is very important for the financial stability in Vietnam. The Vietnamese stock market is also heavily influenced by the regional markets, as there is strong evidence of co-movement. However, it was also witnessed that despite having a similar direction of impact and co-movement, different markets have an influence of different degrees and intensity on the Vietnamese stock market. Lastly, we also witnessed that as compared to the Global Financial Crisis, the recent periods showed comparatively lesser responsiveness. This could be associated with the intensive reaction during the period of financial turmoil as well as with an increase in the stability of the Vietnamese stock market as it matures. © 2020 The Authors.

The geo-climatic conditions are a major cause for higher flood damages in Indian states. This study employs the pooled mean group (PMG) approach to examine economic growth in the aftermath of floods in 14 non-special category states in India using flood disaster data over the period 1981–2011. The PMG estimates show that flood impacts in terms of area affected, the population affected, and economic losses due to floods decline real per capita GSDP growth in the long run after taking into account growth-enhancing factors. Moreover, instrumental variables (IV)-two-stage least-squares (2SLS) estimates also confirm that states experience lower real per capita GSDP growth due to higher flood impacts. The results, further, show that higher urbanization and enrollment of higher education increases real per capita GSDP growth in the long run. For robustness check, the study investigates the impact of floods on real per capita GSDP growth after taking into account government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption. The PMG and IV-2SLS estimates produce same results and confirm that flood impacts reduce real per capita GSDP growth, while government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption enhances real per capita GSDP growth. Overall, results confirm that flood management policies are essential to minimize the adverse impacts of floods on the growth of real per capita GSDP. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Damage due to flood; India; IV-2SLS; Per capita GSDP growth; PMG estimation; Urbanization","economic growth; energy use; flooding; Gross Domestic Product; higher education; public spending; state role; urbanization; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078055000

Among the complicating factors are technology innovation, escalating scales, and diversity of software and hardware applications, increasing availability and scrutiny of big data, and evolving business, environmental, and legal contexts. These factors are engaging system owner/operators to continually reprioritize these investments, even as transparent principles for investment are needed for appropriate oversight and auditing. In this paper, a branch of resilience analysis offers to address multiple layers of uncertainty that arise from technology plans around future disruptions to large-scale systems-of-systems. The paper presents a methodology to quantify and manage the disruptive influence of individual systems perspectives to the prioritization of technology investments across the system-of-systems. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study on an information technology investment portfolio of the US Department of Commerce, USA. The experience suggests how fiscal limitations, combining with several other factors, has the largest disruption to the prioritization of investments. The results furthermore describe how investments perform relative to one another and characterize where the system-of-systems might be resilient to the perspectives of constituent systems.

Along with increasing the volume of customers' reviews on sites, the need for a method that can be used to rank alternative products considering a set of product features and the customer comments related to these features on websites is essential. Many attempts have been made aimed at product ranking through online customer reviews (OCRs), which have their own shortcomings. These limitations occur during different stages, including focusing only on specified features on online shopping sites or extracting features based on term frequency. Other limitations are not paying attention to low repetition, but to only important features (in identifying features), not paying attention to neutral expressions including hesitations or uncertainty in consumers’ purchase decisions (in identifying the sentiment orientations of each review), using expert-based approaches to determine the weight of features (in determining the weight of features), and ranking merely based on the star rating and ignoring the valuable information in OCRs or not considering the robustness of decision-making and most effective features (in ranking alternatives). Accordingly, this study aims to narrow these gaps by proposing an integrated framework that combines sentiment analysis (SA) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). In the following, the developed hybrid model has been used in a real-world case to rank five mobile phone products using the OCRs on the Amazon site to illustrate the availability and utility of the proposed methodology. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the most robust method and most effective features. © 2021","IF-IDOCRIW; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Multi-criteria decision-making; Online reviews; Product ranking; Sentiment analysis","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Fuzzy sets; Sensitivity analysis; Sentiment analysis; Websites; Consumer purchase; IF-IDOCRIW; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-criterion decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Online customer reviews; Online reviews; Product ranking; Sentiment analysis; Sales; artificial neural network; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; Internet; multicriteria analysis; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113925775

The BIN model reveals that noise reduction plays a surprisingly consistent role across all three methods of enhancing performance.

The topic has both practical and scholarly implications. We start with an observation: the variability of orders placed to suppliers is larger than the variability of sales to customers for most firms, yet the aggregate demand variability felt by suppliers upstream does not amplify commensurably. We hypothesize that changes to the supplier’s customer base can smooth out its aggregate demand. We test the hypothesis with a data set that tracks the evolution of supply relationships over time. We show that the effect of customer base management extends beyond the statistical benefits of aggregation. In particular, both the formation and the dissolution of customer-supplier relationships are associated with the smoothing of the aggregate demand experienced by suppliers. This provides fresh insight into how firms may leverage their customer-supplier relationships to mitigate the impact of the BWE.

Employing a conditional latent class model, we then examine the relationship between this measure and economic growth for 93 countries during the period 1988–2005. We find that the impact of early stage activity differs across three clusters of countries. And we find that GDP levels can predict the cluster and the sign of the coefficient in a non-linear manner. In the richest countries, exporting products that are in an early stage of their product life cycle is associated with higher growth rates. In contrast, we find a cluster of middle income countries with high growth rates that grow faster by exporting more mature products that are in the later stages of their life cycle. Finally, early stage activity has no significant impact on growth in the cluster of the poorest, developing countries. Countries in early stages of development should focus on acquiring market share in mature markets with routine technologies whereas emerging economies face the challenge of at some point switching from copying mature to inventing new products as they approach the global technology frontier. At that frontier they must join the advanced economies who specialise in early stage innovative products to stay ahead of increasing competition from abroad. © 2017, The Author(s).","Conditional latent class model; Economic growth; Maturity; Product life cycles; Trade","Commerce; Competition; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Advanced economies; Economic growths; Emerging economies; Innovative product; Latent class model; Maturity; Middle-income countries; Product life cycles; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019662386

Academic/practical relevance: Staffing decisions account for a large portion of a retailer's operational costs. Researchers have studied the extent to which an increase in staffing levels translates into greater revenues, without emphasizing the underlying mechanisms that generate this potential improvement, such as assisting customers. Methodology: We use econometric methods, including survival-analysis techniques, to analyze data gathered from in-store video recordings of customer visits to stores of a women's apparel chain. Results: We find that, under average store conditions, a 25% increase in labor yields a 16% increase in store revenues. An increase in the assistance of customers while searching, browsing, or trying products mediates approximately 50% of this increase, while the remainder originates from other activities, such as helping customers at the checkout counter. Moreover, we find that this form of assistance has a significant and positive impact on both conversion and ticket size. Managerial implications: Our approach can be used to explain heterogeneity in employee productivity across stores, to monitor and detect unexpected deviations in customer-assistance levels, and to measure the productivity of multitasking agents for the different functions that they perform.

Relationships between employee satisfaction, values, positivity and negativity, employee retention, and industry allow human resource managers to make decisions on employee recruitment techniques and budgets, employee retention efforts, and even company image initiatives. Traditional methods for identifying employee values, job satisfaction, and linkages to important company outcomes are through employee entrance/exit surveys, annual evaluations, and informal interactions. In recent years, companies and researchers have begun to take advantage of the increasing ubiquity of online reviews, including unstructured text responses. In this paper we explore 682,176 employee reviews of Fortune 50 companies from Indeed.com using Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify salient aspects in employee reviews and automatically infer latent topics that are salient factors related to employee satisfaction. We compare these topics with the five facets of the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) that are traditionally used to measure job satisfaction among human resource experts. We conduct further analysis comparing comments of current vs. former employees. Results suggests that management may be an important salient factor in employee satisfaction and turnover, as it is consistently mentioned by current and former employees in both positive and the negative comments. Similarly, monetary benefits are mentioned as a negative by former employees, but as a positive for current employees. Furthermore, we examine topic differences by industry sector and find that retail employees frequently mention Pay and Benefits and Length of Breaks, whereas technology sector employees were more concerned with Work-Life Balance. Our results can be used to support company behavioral management decision makers to conceive and evaluate initiatives intended to enhance employee satisfaction. Furthermore, our techniques, including the visualization of topic composition and quality, are generalizable to any setting that uses topic discovery from unstructured text, such as customer reviews, social media posts, and critic reviews, especially when comparing topics across entities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Employee satisfaction; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Topic modeling","Budget control; Decision making; Job satisfaction; Behavioral management; Employee retention; Employee satisfaction; Employee turnover; Informal interactions; Resource managers; Technology sectors; Unstructured texts; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106297687

Our models are based on a dyadic supply chain consisting of a loss-averse supplier and a capital-constrained retailer who can get finance via bank credit or trade credit. We derive the optimal trade credit contract under the retailer-dominant noncooperative (RDN) and the supplier-dominant noncooperative (SDN) games. Our results show that the impact of the supplier's loss aversion depends on whether the supplier dominates the supply chain. Specifically, under RDN scenario, a single bank credit should be adopted by the retailer, irrespective of the supplier's loss aversion. Under SDN scenario, however, a hybrid of bank credit and trade credit should be provided to the retailer when the supplier's loss aversion level exceeds a critical threshold value, and a single trade credit should be granted otherwise. Moreover, we find that the capital-constrained retailer may benefit from the supplier's loss aversion behavior. Finally, we conduct a serial of numerical examples to develop more managerial insights. © 2020 The Authors.

Hence, the article aims to fill this gap by providing a systemic representation of how OI enhances project-based organisations' productivity. The article focuses on the construction ecosystem since construction is an exemplary project-based industry and is known for its widespread and longstanding poor productivity. In particular, we investigated how OI is adopted and how OI can enhance productivity in the construction ecosystem. We conducted twenty semi-structured interviews with experts involved in OI construction projects in the UK. This paper makes three academic contributions. First, it provides an account of the most relevant causes for poor productivity in construction. Second, it consolidates primary and secondary data in a novel cognitive map providing a systemic representation of how OI enhances productivity in construction. The validity of the map goes beyond the boundaries of the construction ecosystem, being supported by several cross-sectorial references. Third, the paper offers six strategies that leverage OI to address the specific causes of low productivity in construction. © 2021","Construction; Innovation ecosystem; Inter-organisational collaboration; Open innovation; Productivity; Project-based firms","Ecosystems; Construction projects; Innovation ecosystem; Interorganizational collaboration; Open innovation; Primary data; Project-based; Project-based firms; Project-based organizations; Secondary datum; Semi structured interviews; Productivity; construction industry; innovation; organization; productivity; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102877342

Different from the researches focusing on specific applications of blockchain technology in a certain field, this study devotes to capturing the attitudes of investors regarding different risk criteria in blockchain technology investment decision making. We use personalized quantifiers to extract investors’ preferences on each risk evaluation criterion. At present, the personalized quantifier that can reflect individual attitudes and behavior intentions have been fitted by various functions, but there are still limitations. In this regard, this paper introduces a cubic spline interpolation function to fit the personalized quantifier, and addresses the consistency of the personalized quantifier in the ordered weighted averaging aggregation. Moreover, we employ a qualitative information representation model called probabilistic linguistic term sets to express decision-makers' evaluations on each criterion. We give a case study to illustrate the usability of the proposed personalized quantifier in blockchain risk evaluation. The comparative analysis with other four types of personalized quantifiers shows that our proposed personalized quantifier with cubic spline interpolation has ideal geometric characteristics in terms of smooth curve and high fitting accuracy, thus having strong applicability. Further, we show that this method is relatively easy to operate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain technology investment; Cubic spline interpolation; Information representation of blockchain; Personalized quantifier; Probabilistic linguistic information; Risk evaluation","Blockchain; Curve fitting; Decision making; Economics; Function evaluation; Interpolation; Linguistics; Block-chain; Blockchain technology investment; Cubic-spline interpolation; Information representation; Information representation of blockchain; Personalized quantifier; Probabilistic linguistic information; Risk criteria; Risk evaluation; Technology risks; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102476389

Lindner College of Business, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH  45221, United States","Problem definition: We have witnessed a rapid rise of on-demand platforms, such as Uber, in the past few years. Although these platforms allow workers to choose their own working hours, they have limited leverage in maintaining availability of workers within a region. As such, platforms often implement various policies, including offering financial incentives and/or communicating customer demand to workers in order to direct more workers to regions with shortage in supply. This research examines how behavioral biases such as regret aversion may influence workers' relocation decisions and ultimately the system performance. Academic/practical relevance: Studies on on-demand platforms often assume that workers are rational agents who make optimal decisions. Our research investigates workers' relocation decisions from a behavioral perspective. A deeper understanding of workers' behavioral biases and their causes will help on-demand platforms design appropriate policies to increase their own profit, worker surplus, and the overall efficiency of matching supply with demand. Methodology: We use a combination of behavioral modeling and controlled laboratory experiments. We develop analytical models that incorporate regret aversion to produce theoretical predictions, which are then tested and verified via a series of controlled laboratory experiments. Results: We find that regret aversion plays an important role in workers' relocation decisions. Regret-Averse workers are more willing to relocate to the supply-shortage zone than rational workers. This increased relocation behavior, however, is not sufficient to translate to a better system performance. Platform interventions, such as demand information sharing and dynamic wage bonus, can help further improve the system. We find that workers' regret-Aversion behavior may lead to an increased profit for the platform, a higher surplus for the workers, and an improved demand-supplymatching efficiency, thus benefiting the entire on-demand system. Managerial implications: Our research emphasizes the importance and necessity of incorporating workers' behavioral biases such as regret aversion into the policy design of on-demand platforms. Policies without considering the behavioral aspect of workers' decision may lead to lost profit for the platform and reduced welfare for workers and customers, which may ultimately hurt the on-demand business. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This study provides a unique contribution to social sustainability governance by utilizing a causal-effect analysis to classify noncompliance antecedents into causal and effect groups and analyze the interactions. Combining a structured Delphi technique, involving thirty senior manufacturing professionals in the Indian apparel sector, with a fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method (DEMATEL) revealed specific antecedents related to the adherence to social sustainability standards. The most influential antecedents identified were manufacturing cluster behavior, stringent regulations, multiple standards, business continuity, and buyer preference. Notably, the study theorizes that a supplier's compliance deliberations intertwine with operational considerations around business volumes, costs, inappropriate governance, and regional cultural norms. Stakeholder theory and the theory of reasoned action help explain the institutional logics underlying the interactions between antecedents and highlight the crucial need for local production hubs to adopt universal social compliance codes. To our knowledge, this research is the first to identify manufacturing cluster behavior as a leading cause of noncompliance, highlighting the need to recognize clusters as essential stakeholders. The study has notable implications for brands, suppliers, governments, manufacturing councils, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that call for coordinated action and new forms of governance to minimize the incidences of noncompliance by apparel suppliers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Apparel industry; Compliance; Global value chain; Social sustainability; Supplier code of conduct","Clothes; Decision making; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Business continuity; Coordinated actions; Fuzzy Decision making; Institutional logic; Nongovernmental organizations; Social sustainability; Stringent regulations; Theory of reasoned action; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100439920

However effective environmental investment prediction usually has to fact three challenges about diversiform indicators, insufficient data, and the reliability of prediction models. In the present study, a new prediction model is proposed using the extended belief rule-based system (EBRBS) and evidential reasoning (ER) rule, called ensemble EBRBS model, with the aim to overcome the above challenges for better environmental investment prediction. The proposed ensemble EBRBS model consists of two components: 1) multiple EBRBSs, which are constructed on the basis of not only using various feature selection methods to select representative indicators but also data increment transformation to enrich the training data; 2) an ER rule-based combination method, which utilizes the ER rule to accommodate the weights and reliabilities of different EBRBSs with the predicted outputs of these EBRBSs to have an integrated environmental investment prediction. A detailed case study is then provided for validating the proposed model via extensive experimental and comparison analysis based on the real-world environmental data about 25 environmental indicators for 31 provinces in China ranged from 2005 to 2018. The results demonstrate that the ensemble EBRBS model can be used as an effective model to accurately predict environmental investments. More importantly, the ensemble EBRBS model not only obtains a high accuracy better than some existing prediction models, but also has an excellent robustness compared with others under the situations of excessive indicators and insufficient data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ensemble model; Evidential reasoning rule; Extended belief rule-based system; Investment prediction","Environmental management; Forecasting; Investments; Metadata; Pollution control; Belief rule-based systems; Combination method; Comparison analysis; Environmental indicators; Environmental investments; Environmental pollutions; Evidential reasoning; Feature selection methods; Predictive analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098844541

Although it may be obvious that replacing humans with machines would increase efficiency, it is not clear whether and how machines can improve human decisions. We answer this question in the context of crowd lending, in which decisions are traditionally made by a crowd of investors. Using data from Prosper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts listing default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The improvement of the machine over the crowd predictions is more pronounced for highly risky listings. We then use the machine to make investment decisions and find that the machine improves upon investors' decisions and leads to greater welfare for both investors and borrowers simultaneously. When machine prediction is used to select loans, it leads to a higher rate of return for investors and more funding opportunities for borrowers with few alternative funding options. We also find suggestive evidence that the machine is biased in gender and race even when it does not use gender and race information as input. We propose a general and effective ""debiasing"" method that can be applied to any prediction-focused ML applications and demonstrate its use in our context. We show that the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still improves the crowd's investment decisions in our context. These results indicate that ML can help crowd-lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources. © 2021 INFORMS","Algorithmic bias; Crowdfunding; Fintech; Machine learning; Peer-to-peer lending","Earnings; Forecasting; Investments; Default probabilities; Financial resources; Funding opportunities; Human decisions; Investment decisions; Ml algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Rate of return; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104297551

To operationalize relative power of a CEO over a CFO, we define CFO co-option as the appointment of a CFO after a CEO assumes office. We find that CFO co-option is associated with a CEO pay premium of about 10%, which is concentrated more in the early years of the co-opted CFO’s tenure and in components of compensation that vary with the achievement of analyst-based earnings targets. Our evidence also indicates that a primary channel through which CEO power over a co-opted CFO yields the achievement of earnings targets is the use of earnings management to inflate earnings. Co-opted CFOs rely primarily on using discretionary accruals to manage earnings prior to the Sarbanes–Oxley regulatory intervention and switch to real-activities manipulation afterward. The evidence thus suggests that the form of earnings management depends on costs imposed on the CFO to inflate earnings. © 2020 INFORMS","CEO; CFO; Discretionary accruals; Earnings management; Executive compensation; Financial reporting; Managerial power; Monitoring; Real earnings management","Operations research; CEO compensations; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officer compensations; Chief financial officers; Earnings management; Regulatory interventions; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102136822

A feature launch on a major doctor appointment booking platform allows us to examine the effects of online WOM on three dimensions of a consumer’s choice process: the consideration set size, the time taken to consider alternatives (web session duration), and the geographic dispersion of the choices considered. Results indicate that the effects of WOM on decision-making processes are not monotonic but rather are contingent on the abundance of WOM (number of rated doctors) in a market. When the abundance of WOM is high, the introduction of WOM makes patients consider fewer doctors, browse for a shorter duration, and focus on doctors that are geographically more proximate. In contrast, when the abundance of WOM is low, the introduction of WOM makes patients consider more doctors, browse for longer duration, and consider doctors that are geographically more dispersed. We also find that WOM can lead to a cannibalization effect: when ratings are published, the highly rated doctors reap the benefits (in the form of increased demand) at the expense of unrated doctors. Our study contributes to the extant literature on online WOM by providing new insights into how WOM influences consumer decision making and by examining this question at a more granular level than prior work.

In this paper, an analytic hierarchy process method was applied to systematically highlight how experts prioritize various factors and contexts in their decisions to implement energy efficiency retrofit. This study surveyed 236 facility management experts in the United States to obtain a consensus about how they prioritized five decision criteria, including 15 factors to retrofit. Additionally, a cross-context comparison was conducted to examine differing perceptions of retrofit as a function of physical, functional, and social contexts. The three most important factors across all US respondents were payback period, life-cycle cost, and funding mechanism. The least considered factors were CO2 emissions, educational programs, and demand pressure. This study revealed no significant disagreement between public and private institutions or between executives and nonexecutives. Larger magnitudes of weight differences were observed mainly among diverse climate zones and industry sectors.

In parts-to-picker systems, automated vehicles or cranes bring the parts to a human picker. The storage assignment policy, the assignment of products to the storage locations, influences order picking efficiency. Commonly used storage assignment policies, such as full turnover-based and class-based storage, only consider the frequency at which each product has been requested but ignore information on the frequency at which products are ordered jointly, known as product affinity. Warehouses can use product affinity to make informed decisions and assign multiple correlated products to the same inventory “pod” to reduce retrieval time. Existing affinity-based assignments sequentially cluster products with high affinity and assign the clusters to storage locations. We propose an integrated cluster allocation (ICA) policy to minimize the retrieval time of parts-to-picker systems based on both product turnover and affinity obtained from historical customer orders. We formulate a mathematical model that can solve small instances and develop a greedy construction heuristic for solving large instances. The ICA storage policy can reduce total retrieval time by up to 40% compared to full turnover-based storage and class-based policies. The model is validated using a real warehouse dataset and tested against uncertainties in customer demand and for different travel time models. © 2021 The Authors","Analytical and simulation modeling; Automated warehousing; Cluster-based storage; Correlated storage; Performance analysis; Product affinity; Storage policy","automation; data mining; logistics; numerical model; performance assessment; storage; travel time; Gruidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099213844

The effects of the app in allowing greater demand-side flexibility from household consumers is estimated based on data from an 18-month field trial involving 1557 Austrian households. These estimates are given as hourly price elasticities of electricity demand and hourly energy efficiency treatment effects from consumer engagement with the app. In a novel methodological coupling, the econometric estimates are input into the Balmorel energy system model, which is used to analyze future scenarios of full renewable energy deployment in the Austrian energy system. The results demonstrate that the impact of the flexible residential demand for electricity is small but significant to future system costs. The total discounted system cost increases by 20–24% in the renewable energy scenarios, compared to a business as usual scenario, due to heavy investments in renewable generation. However, system cost is reduced by 4–7% in renewable energy scenarios where the observed demand-side flexibilities are considered.

Research Design & Methods: Most of the previous studies emphasise the role of institutions in entrepreneurial activity, while ignoring the role of entrepreneurship in the building of institutions. We estimate how institutions and entrepreneurship relate to each other and contribute to economic growth. For the estimation, we apply the structural equation modelling (SEM) with panel data. Findings: Estimated results show that the regulatory dimension of institutions and entrepreneurship have a strong bidirectional relationship – as we expected – while the normative dimension of institutions and entre-preneurship have a unidirectional association. These two interrelated factors stimulate economic growth. Implications & Recommendations: Policymakers should create a more friendly regulatory environment for entrepreneurship to flourish. In this process, institutional entrepreneurs also play an important role. Contribution & Value Added: There is a need for research on the bilateral relationship between institutions and entrepreneurship. Most previous articles consider the effect that is transmitted from institutions to entrepre-neurship. However, there exists a two-way causal relationship between institutions and entrepreneurship that is worth exploring. In this regard, the greatest contribution of this article is that it is one of the first empirical works devoted to testing the two-way causal relationship between institutions and entrepreneurship. © 2021, Cracow University of Economics.

As the response to COVID-19 has reduced face-to-face contact, communication via social media has increased. Evidence shows that social media affects disease (non-)prevention through the (im)proper distribution of information, and distorts the predictive accuracy of infection models, including legacy Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) models. Our adjusted SEIR model reflects the effectiveness of information disseminated through social media by accounting for dimensions of social/informational motivation based on social learning/use and gratification theories, and uses Monte Carlo methodology and computational algorithms to predict effects of social media on the spread of COVID-19 (N = 2,095 cases). The results suggest that social media utilisation measures should be incorporated into SEIR models to improve forecasts of COVID-19 infections. Utilising IS to analyse the spread of digital information via social media platforms can inform efforts to combat the pandemic and infodemic. Agencies responsible for infection and disease control, policy makers, businesses, institutions and educators must accurately monitor infection rates to appropriately allocate funding and human resources and develop effective disease prevention marketing campaigns. © Operational Research Society 2021.","big data analysis; COVID-19 infection; monte carlo method; Pär Ågerfalk, Kieran Conboy and Michael Myers; SEIR model; social media","Computation theory; Disease control; Marketing; Monte Carlo methods; Social networking (online); Computational algorithm; Digital information; Disease prevention; Infection models; Marketing campaign; Predictive accuracy; Social learning; Social media platforms; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101650125

Climate-smart agriculture could be an opportunity in this respect. The paper presents a cost-benefit analysis of the public investment program to promote climate-smart agriculture in Lesotho. Economic profitability of investing in such program in nationwide crop, livestock and aquaculture smallholders’ production is assessed, considering costs and benefits at private level and those that accrue to society. Given uncertainty about the future, a development pathway commercially oriented is compared with a pathway aimed at increasing households’ capacity to adapt their farming systems to the changing climate. Investment returns are above the opportunity cost of capital, under both pathways, indicating the convenience for farmers and the whole society in investing in climate-smart agriculture. The program also leads to a decrease in the greenhouse gas emissions’ intensity, positively contributing to climate change mitigation.

We utilize a mixed-method approach to empirically test the impact of different response strategies on customers (Study 1: experiment) and investors (Study 2: event study). We not only find empirical support that a conforming strategy outperforms both nonconforming strategies concerning stakeholders' affective evaluations of reputation, but extend this proposition to stakeholders' cognitive evaluations of reputation and the financial implications for the firm. The most counterintuitive finding is that overconforming strategies result in lower firm reputation and stock returns relative to conforming strategies. Thus, exceeding stakeholder expectations during a crisis can have unintended negative consequences. Managerial Summary: How should firms react to product recalls? Previous research suggests that exceeding expectations of external stakeholders should have a neutral or even positive impact on firm reputation and financial performance, while falling short of expectations should have a negative impact. In this article, we test the impact of different product recall strategies.

However, it is impossible for personal computer or devices to tackle with such heavy workloads. Then, companies that provides cloud computational services come into business. From the perspective of companies, the cost for providing fog computing services is much higher than the traditional computing services. Consequently, the price for real-Time requests is more expensive than the reserved services. Aiming at minimizing the expenditures, the most important part is how many cloud services the customers should reserve in advance because different amounts they consume will yield different expenses and both of insufficient and excess consumption result in wastes. The emerging machine learning method provides a powerful tool to address such a prediction problem. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Pythagorean fuzzy deep neural network (HPFDNN) to forecast the quantity of requisite cloud services. On account of obtaining the better interpretations of original data, beyond the employment of fuzzy logic, the neural representation is also utilized as a complementary method. The information or the knowledge acquired from fuzzy and neural perspectives are coalesced as the final transformed data to be put into the learning systems, so that the useful information concealed in the enormous contents can be effectively described. On the basis of the anticipation of the deep neural network, the consumers are able to decide the amount of cloud services to purchase. Numerical results based on the real data set from Carnegie Mellon University demonstrate that the proposed model yields the economical predictions and outperforms the prediction by the traditional deep neural network. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Cloud services; fog computing; hierarchical deep neural network; neural representation; pythagorean fuzzy number","Cloud computing; Costs; Data structures; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Edge computing; Fog computing; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy sets; Industry; Learning systems; Neural networks; Personal computers; Web services; Carnegie Mellon University; Cloud services; Complementary methods; Computational model; Fuzzy numbers; Information explosion; Machine learning methods; Neural representations; Fuzzy logic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070698945

Currently, the uncertain global economic environment makes the risk spillovers in the “Oil-Clean energy stocks” system a vital topic to explore. Using a systematic framework involving both Spillover index and Multivariate quantile models, this paper aims at revealing the heterogeneous risk transmission mechanisms between WTI oil futures and 12 clean energy stock indexes over the period of October 2010 to August 2020 from a systematic perspective by considering both regular and extreme conditions. We find asymmetric and time-varying features in the connections between oil and clean energy. The main findings include: (1) responses of extreme downside risks are substantially intensified compared to normal and upside risks; (2) the (downside) VaR response of oil to shocks of clean energy stocks is greater when the oil price is low; (3) the (downside) VaR response of clean energy to oil shocks is heterogeneous especially when the oil price is low. We also find that oil market is a net volatility receiver from clean energy sector overall and especially from the Advanced material and Energy efficiency groups. However, oil is a risk trigger for the Renewable energy group. These findings have significant and abundant implications for investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers to inform their decision-making and promote clean energy investment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Clean energy stock; Crude oil price; Risk spillover; Spillover index; VAR for VaR","Climate change; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Financial markets; Value engineering; Clean energy; Clean energy stock; Crude oil prices; Energy sector; Oil Prices; Rapid growth; Risk spillover; Spillover index; Systematic framework; VAR for VaR; Investments; alternative energy; crude oil; energy market; investment; oil production; price dynamics; spillover effect; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117366598

Such practices are difficult to identify given they exist in the informal economy, and involve vulnerable individuals. Addressing modern slavery by organizations requires awareness of its context and complexities. While corporations have increasingly sought to manage modern slavery risk in their supply chains, their understanding of what modern slavery is and what should be managed remains limited. We argue a key problem with firms’ efforts to manage modern slavery risk is that it is a psychologically distant concept for them. We apply construal level theory to explore how organizations’ psychological distance from modern slavery risk affects their management of risk. We interviewed purchasing executives at 41 global organizations in Australia, Finland, and the U.S and identified four approaches to managing modern slavery risk at different levels of psychological distance. We also identified that conflicts between organizations' approaches to risk and what they identify in their operating environment, precedes important construal shifts that help to improve organizational understanding of labor-related risk. We highlight ways that organizations' understanding of modern slavery risk plays a role in their governance of such risk in supply chains. © 2021 The Authors.

Design strategies for such recovery methods have yet to be fully established in the façade industry. Meanwhile, stringent regulations, aimed at reducing operational carbon emissions of buildings and improving other performance criteria such as occupant safety, have stimulated the use of more complex façade systems that incorporate multiple functions. Other areas of the façade life cycle, such as embodied carbon and high-value material recovery, are rarely considered at the early design stage. This study adopts a mixed-method approach of data collection, to investigate the key challenges and opportunities associated with promoting high-value recovery options for façade products, as perceived by stakeholders in the façade supply-chain. Data was initially collected through an online survey completed by 69 stakeholders from across the façade knowledge/supply-chain. This was followed by 29 semi-structured interviews with selected survey respondents. It emerged that the advancement of circular design strategies is dependent on: increased awareness and quantification of the environmental value of circular design; cross-supply-chain buy-in on developments in take-back infrastructure including greater support for demolition contractors; and advancements in technological separation methods specific to façade components. Enhanced communication between stakeholders - notably between clients, facade contractors and material processors - acceptability criteria and product availability; and more holistic legislation based on whole life cycle emissions, to avoid the over-emphasis on operational efficiency, appear as vital requisites to increasing material efficiency. Finally, we illustrate where stakeholder priorities related to reuse converge and diverge, and thus we identify strategies for levering these factors to minimise environmental impact and optimise economic value in the façade sector. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Design-for-disassembly; Embodied carbon; End-of-life; Façades; Recycling; Reuse","Contractors; Ecodesign; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Laws and legislation; Supply chains; Surveys; Carbon emissions; Circular designs; Circular economy; Design strategies; Embodied carbons; End of lives; Façade; Real-world; Reducing waste; Reuse; Recycling; carbon emission; data set; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste management; Article; awareness; carbon footprint; construction work and architectural phenomena; data collection method; economic aspect; environmental impact; facade industry; human; legal aspect; life cycle; online system; semi structured interview; stakeholder engagement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114676300

Specifically, we examine the impact of national-level SDG performance (NLSP) of 2015 to 2010, as a proxy for the non-enabling institutional environment, on SDGR observed in 2015/2016. This study also explores whether the NLSP-SDGR nexus is contingent on the environmental sensitivity of oil industries in Libya. We employ a quantitative content analysis based on word counts to determine the level of SDGR among a cross-sectional sample of 524 observations of the major Libyan oil companies in the 2015/2016 fiscal year. Using measures derived from the World Development Indicators (WDI), a cross-sectional regression analysis has been employed to investigate how NLSP explains variations in SDGR noted in 2015/2016. Descriptive evidence indicates that Libyan oil companies tend to report SDG information on their websites about Good Health and Well-being (SDG3), Quality Education (SDG4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12). Our regression results suggest that the NLSP positively and significantly influences corporate commitment to the SDGR agenda among a sample of the major oil companies in Libya. Additionally, the environmental sensitivity of oil industries appeared to be moderating the NLSP-SDGR nexus. As SDGR tends to be a self-regulation mechanism, our empirical evidence emphasises the importance of establishing effective regulatory agencies to ensure companies' achievements of their social, environmental, and economic responsibilities efficiently and effectively. © 2021","Environmental sensitivity; Institutional voids; Libya; National-level SDG Performance; Non-enabling institutional environment; Oil sector; Political change; SDG Reporting","Economics; Environmental regulations; Quality control; Sustainable development; Environmental sensitivities; Institutional void; Libya; National level; National-level SDG performance; Non-enabling institutional environment; Oil sectors; Performance; Political changes; SDG reporting; Regression analysis; corporate social responsibility; oil industry; oil production; political change; political economy; resource management; Sustainable Development Goal; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110714899

The source of uncertainty allows us to define two different scenarios; (i) in situations of endogenous uncertainty in input and output data where the uncertainty is affected by the decision maker's decisions, and (ii) in situations of uncertain prices for inputs where the uncertainty is exogenously given. In the first scenario, the theory of robust optimisation is adopted to develop the robust data envelopment analysis (DEA) models with the aim of grappling uncertainties in input and output data when measuring technical and cost efficiencies. The second scenario aims to accommodate uncertainties on price information by developing a pair of robust DEA models based upon robust optimisation estimating the upper and lower bounds for CE measures. This unprecedented study helps us to provide a generalised framework for economic efficiency with uncertainties in which conventional properties of Farrell measures are fulfilled. In addition to comparing the developed approach in this paper with other existing approaches through a simple numerical example, the usefulness and applicability of the suggested framework are minutely studied in an empirical application in the context of allocation problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cost efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Robust optimisation; Uncertainty","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economic efficiency; Optimization; Production efficiency; Uncertainty analysis; Cost-efficiency; Data envelopment analysis models; Economic efficiency; Efficiency measure; Input and outputs; Input datas; Output data; Robust datum; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; Data envelopment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103700069

In recent years, it has been widely used to evaluate two-stage systems under different organization mechanisms. This study modifies the conventional leader–follower DEA models for two-stage systems by considering the uncertainty of data. The dual deterministic linear models are first constructed from the stochastic CCR models under the assumption that all components of inputs, outputs, and intermediate products are related only with some basic stochastic factors, which follow continuous and symmetric distributions with nonnegative compact supports. The stochastic leader–follower DEA models are then developed for measuring the efficiencies of the two stages. The stochastic efficiency of the whole system can be uniquely decomposed into the product of the efficiencies of the two stages. Relationships between stochastic efficiencies from stochastic CCR and stochastic leader–follower DEA models are also discussed. An example of the commercial banks in China is considered using the proposed models under different risk levels. © 2021 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.","Data envelopment analysis; Leader–follower; Performance evaluation; Stochastic network DEA; Two-stage systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101023894

The social distancing requirement, with the aim of reducing contact risk in public transit, could exacerbate traffic congestion and emissions. We propose a simulation tool to evaluate the trade-offs between traffic congestion, emissions, and policies impacting travel behavior to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 including social distancing and working from home. Open-source agent-based simulation models are used to evaluate the transportation system usage for the case study of New York City. A Post Processing Software for Air Quality (PPS-AQ) estimation is used to evaluate the air quality impacts. Finally, system-wide contact exposure on the subway is estimated from the traffic simulation output. The social distancing requirement in public transit is found to be effective in reducing contact exposure, but it has negative congestion and emission impacts on Manhattan and neighborhoods at transit and commercial hubs. While telework can reduce congestion and emissions citywide, in Manhattan the negative impacts are higher due to behavioral inertia and social distancing. The findings suggest that contact exposure to COVID-19 on subways is relatively low, especially if social distancing practices are followed. The proposed integrated traffic simulation models and air quality estimation model can help policymakers evaluate the impact of policies on traffic congestion and emissions as well as identifying hot spots, both temporally and spatially. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Emissions; Pandemic; Public transit; Traffic congestion; Travel behavior","Economic and social effects; Open source software; Open systems; Quality control; Subways; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; COVID-19; Emission; Manhattans; Pandemic; Public transit; Quality estimation; Trade off; Traffic emissions; Traffic Policies; Travel behaviour; Air quality; mobility; public transport; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic congestion; transportation development; transportation system; travel behavior; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116619525

The production cost includes pump energy, while the size of the system is considered as an output variable. The performance of ED system depends on three categories of process parameters namely water quality data, stack configuration and flow characteristic inside the stack. The design of ED system is complex due to interrelation among the system variables so the design calculation chronology steps are developed with flow-chart for the fix feed salinity of groundwater and salt removal rate. The effect of recovery ratio on capital and energy cost is studied and found unidirectional. Sparingly soluble salt present in feed decides the upper limit and obtained 70–75% recovery rate based on the feedwater quality. The optimum value of the linear flow velocity and cell-pair thickness can be obtained by the trade-off among capital cost, stack energy cost and pumping energy cost. Simultaneous effect of both the variable on minimizing the total cost gives the narrow working range of flow velocity 15–17 cm/s and 0.4–0.8 mm thickness.

The informal economy is thus important for recruiting workers for labor platforms. Platform use, however, requires formal service provision, which workers in the informal economy often resist. Thus, labor platforms have to promote workers’ transition from informal to formal service provision. While recent studies have hinted at labor platforms’ fostering of formal economic activity, we know little about how such intermediation unfolds. We use a process lens and comprehensive qualitative data on labor platforms in Panama and Mexico to study how labor platforms steer workers to formal service provision. Detailing the interactive process of workers transitioning to formal service provision as triggered by labor platforms, we add to platform research and literature on intermediation between informal and formal economic activity. @ VC The Author(s) 2021.

However, practitioners and scholars also agree that when those actions are deployed in slow growing markets, the resulting proliferation of products, markets, and channels may erode profits. This is a phenomenon sometimes labelled by practitioners as ""the complexity crisis"". The literature does not provide a simple and direct measure for variety-induced supply chain complexity that reflects the potentially negative relation between complexity and profitability. Based on the concept of structural complexity in the supply chain that links it to the proliferation of products, markets, and channels, this work assesses the capability of a proposed measure for structural complexity, referred to as pars-Complexity, to capture this relationship. We computed the pars-Complexity of 27 business units of a multinational company and used the obtained values to assess the theoretical relationship between supply chain structural complexity and the company's financial performance. The results indicate that the pars-Complexity measure captures the theoretical relationship between structural complexity and performance, shedding light on its empirical validity. In particular, we find that business units with low values of pars-complexity notably outperform those with higher figures in terms of pre-tax margin. This measure could be applied to companies of manufacturing industries such as food processing, automotive, cosmetics, and fashion or service sector, for instance, healthcare. In addition, the practical relevance of the measure is highlighted with evidence on its potential use as an aid for fixed-costs allocation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Financial performance; Operating profit; Pars-complexity measure; Structural complexity; Supply chain complexity","Commerce; Food processing; Profitability; Business units; Financial performance; Multichannel; Operating profit; Par-complexity measure; Product channel; Product markets; Product variety; Structural complexity; Supply chain complexity; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111207556

Two game theory models are established to reveal the underline mechanism of how SE platforms design and improve their service operations through matching the information-processing capacities (IPC) with the changing information-processing requirements (IPR). The findings show that under different combinations of IPR and IPC, SE falls into four kinds of match zones. The study further identified that pricing strategy and trust building are two initial strategies to increase SE platforms’ IPR, which starts up service operation. And supply chain structure change and information technology are essential to improve firms’ IPC, which increases service operation efficiency. The findings are further demonstrated and verified through a longitudinal case study. This research provides guidance for practitioners to identify the position of a SE platform through evaluating the company's information processing capabilities and suggests what information processing strategies should be deployed and implemented for specific supply chains. This is one of the first studies theoretically explains and empirically demonstrates how specific information processing mechanisms can be gainfully aligned with different statuses of SE platforms. Doing so, it reinforces the conceptual foundation that SE firms should align and leverage on information capability management to achieve operation effectiveness and efficiency in service management. © 2021","Information processing theory; matching; service management; Sharing Economy","Efficiency; Game theory; Information management; Game theory models; Information processing theories; Matchings; Processing capacities; Service management; Service operations; Service performance; Service provisions; Sharing economy; Specific information; Supply chains; conceptual framework; design; game theory; information processing; information technology; service provision; supply chain management; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108789075

However, in the case of emerging economies, firms are more financially constrained, and they tend to suffer from weaker-management practices, which can be a drag on their performance despite greater innovation. Hence, whether better-managed firms benefit more effectively from innovation with greater access to finance remains unexplored. Using quarterly firm-level data during 1992–2015 from Turkey, this paper aims to uncover whether innovation intensity, in the traditional sense, namely R&D and intangibles, and better managerial practices, in the modern form, contribute to the performance of Turkish firms. By considering the financial constraints before and after the 2008 global financial crisis and by undertaking an impact evaluation of improved accounting regulation relating to disclosure on management practices, we find that all types of innovation activities boost profitability. In addition, R&D activities, with better management quality, help improve firm performance. Furthermore, although higher debt level, in general, is harmful, firms with better management quality make more effective use of innovative activities, along with higher financial leverage, in boosting their performance. Lastly, those better-managed firms in an emerging economy outperformed even during times of financial stress following the global financial crisis. The above findings survive a battery of robustness checks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","financial-leverage; global financial crisis; innovation; management quality; profitability; R&D","Engineering; Financial constraints; Global financial crisis; Innovation activity; Innovation intensity; Innovative activities; Management practices; Managerial practices; Types of innovations; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105784232

To some extent, diversification-consistent DEA is more favored by researchers compared with traditional DEA for it deals fully with portfolio diversification. However, the existing studies assume that decision-makers can accurately estimate the statistical characteristics of portfolio returns and ignore the impact of parameter uncertainty on the portfolio efficiency and its ranking. In this paper, we construct three diversification-consistent DEA models under the mean-variance framework. We treat the expectation and covariance of portfolio return as interval values to characterize the parameter uncertainly in the proposed DEA models. And the bi-level programming models and the corresponding equivalent models are also provided to obtain the lower and upper bounds of portfolio efficiency. We select 30 American industry portfolios and perform some empirical analyses under different datasets to find out which model has better robustness in dealing with the impact of parameter uncertainty on the portfolio efficiency and its ranking. Finally, we provide some robustness tests to further verify the consistency of our findings. © 2020","Data envelopment analysis; Diversification-consistent DEA; Mean-variance criterion; Parameter uncertainty; Portfolio efficiency","article; covariance; expectation; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096529977

We propose that a sizable fraction of this variation results from differences in how visual attention is allocated to different features of the decision, such as earlier versus future rewards, and that fluctuations in attentional patterns alter choices. We first tested this hypothesis in an experiment in which participants chose between receiving smaller-sooner versus larger-later monetary rewards while their attention was recorded with eye tracking. We found that cross-participant variation in the allocation of attention explained between 40% and 53% of the individual differences in discounting and that cross-trial variation explained 16% of the participants' propensity to choose the delayed option. To test causality, multiple additional experiments exogenously manipulated the allocation of visual attention and found that shifting attention to attributes that are relatively more attractive in a larger-later option increased patient decision making and altered purchasing behavior. Together, these results are consistent with the existence of a causal impact of visual attention on intertemporal choice and suggest that manipulating attention can have a sizeable impact for important managerial and public policy choice domains. © 2021 INFORMS.","Attention; Discounting; Intertemporal choice; Self-control","Decision making; Eye tracking; Additional experiments; Allocation of attentions; Discount rates; Individual Differences; Inter-temporal choices; Monetary rewards; Purchasing behaviors; Visual Attention; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107133499

Unlike conventional jet-fuel, SAFs can be produced in several production pathways making their selection a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem with conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose a multicriteria based framework for evaluating SAF production pathways, which is a sequential decision-making process with feedback adjustment mechanisms. Given the early stage of SAF technologies' development and the scarcity of data on such technologies, in this research, we involved a variety of aviation industry stakeholders to assist with data and preference gathering. Our MCDM framework is designed to be generic to provide flexibilities to potential users in choosing the appropriate implementation decisions for the relevant stakeholders. The strength of the proposed framework lays in its flexibility to accommodate various stakeholders' subjective judgements, choice of ranking method, and robustness of results. We used our MCDM framework within a stakeholders’ participatory approach to rank order 11 SAF production pathways against 24 criteria grouped under social, environmental, economic, and technical impact categories. Our analysis revealed that the environmental and the economic impact categories are the most important ones followed by the technical and the social criteria; the gasification/Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) based production processes are preferred over fermentation and oil-based ones; and waste gases are the preferred feedstock along with wood-residue. These findings provide decision-makers with guidelines on the selection of SAF production pathways. © 2021 The Author(s)","Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); PROMETHEE; Sustainability; Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF); TOPSIS; VIKOR","Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; Aviation fuel; Fuel production; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making frameworks; Participatory approach; Production pathways; PROMETHEE; Sustainable aviation fuel; TOPSIS; VIKOR; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106296376

Moreover, there are coordination tools, such as pricing and advertising, which impact its performance. In this paper, we offer a two-stage approach to model and solve a sustainable CLSC, taking into account pricing, green quality, and advertising. In the first stage, optimal decisions on pricing, greening, and advertising are made, while in the second stage, a fuzzy multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used to maximize the total profit, reduce CO2 emissions, and improve social impacts. Suitable solution methods are introduced according to the scale of the problem. For small-scale instances, an augmented ϵ-constraint method is used to solve the problem. For large-scale instances, approximations are required, and a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm solves the problem in polynomial time. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through various numerical examples. The results illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the model, while confirming significant improvements in sustainable objectives under optimal pricing, green quality, and advertising. Besides, the proposed Lagrangian relaxation method significantly reduces the computational time for large-scale instances, with only a 2.308% deviation from the optimal results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Augmented ϵ-constraint; CO2 emissions; Lagrangian relaxation; Multi-objective programming; Supply chain pricing; Sustainable closed-loop supply chain","Approximation algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Polynomial approximation; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Advertizing; Augmented ϵ-constraint; Closed-loop; CO$-2$/ emission; Lagrangian relaxations; Multi-objectives programming; Performance; Social impact; Supply chain pricing; Sustainable closed-loop supply chain; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105930547

This algorithm aims to address the issues of (i) identifying the suitable size of clusters in SOM, (ii) information loss in rough SOM (RSOM), and (iii) uncertainty arising from the overlapping patterns of decision classes in GSOM. In RT-GSOM, the network is allowed to grow based on indiscernible reducts and tolerance thresholds extracted from data in an unsupervised way. The network is initialized with the samples extracted from these reducts, and the weights are initialized with random category index. For each decision class, one set of indiscernible reducts is obtained. The tolerance threshold for each decision class is defined using the average distance among all the samples present in the reduct set corresponding to the same class. The superiority of RT-GSOM is demonstrated over twelve benchmark datasets (both categorical and continuous) obtained from UCI machine learning repository.

Yet, the precise nature of cognition that propels decision-makers to endorse novelty is not well understood. We propose that expertise distance is a fundamental force shaping decision-makers' willingness to invest in novelty. We further suggest that the level of mental construal through which information is processed moderates the effect of expertise distance on investment propensity, principally by changing decision-makers' perceptions of an idea's novelty and usefulness. We test our theory in two studies. Study 1 is a field study of 120 decision-makers considering a novel technological idea—quantum key distribution. Study 2 is an experiment that conceptually replicates our first study. Our findings contribute to the debate on strategic cognition and the microfoundations of strategic adaptation. Managerial summary: While the pursuit of novel technological ideas is the driving force of sustained competitive advantage, managers often reject novel ideas in favor of more familiar ones. How then can managers who are out of their depth with a novel technology make sense of it without rejecting it outright? Some suggest that managers should mentally extrapolate from prior experiences with similar ideas. Yet, such extrapolation is impossible when ideas are truly novel and no previous experience with related ideas can be called upon. We resolve this issue by showing that the level at which managers who are unfamiliar with a novel technological idea mentally process it (abstract versus concrete) influences their perceptions of the idea's novelty and usefulness, which, in turn, influences their propensity to invest. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","construal level; expertise distance; inertia; managerial cognition; novelty; technology","Competition; Decision making; Extrapolation; Managers; Construal levels; Decision makers; Driving forces; Force shaping; Micro-foundations; Prior experience; Strategic adaptations; Sustained competitive advantages; Quantum cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100736534

The core argument is that the temporal sequence of selection matters because projects that appear in a sequence following a funded project are themselves less likely to receive funding. Building on the idea that selecting R&D projects is a demanding process that drains participants' mental and emotional resources, we further theorize the moderating effect of the influence of the timing of the panel meeting on the sequence effect. We test these conjectures using a randomization in sequence order from several rounds of R&D project selection at a leading professional service firm. We find robust support for the existence of a sequence effect in R&D as well as for the moderating effect. We further explore different explanations for the sequence effect and how it passes from the individual to the panel.

In this research, we investigate the foundations of BI&A by using foundational literature on DSS to open the ‘black box’ of BI&A systems. We argue that BI&A is fundamentally a subfield of DSS that is seeking to convert more data into deeper insight, but it has lost its connection to DSS literature and, thereby, missed research opportunities. In this paper, we first define DSS and BI&A and then present a systematic review of foundational DSS literature to assess their leveraging in BI&A research. By classifying cited DSS articles and citing BI&A articles into four areas: conceptual framework, design & implementation, business value & organizational use, and cognition & decision making, potential research for BI&A is uncovered. We reconcile these two research streams by mapping BI&A frameworks to classical DSS components through interviews with practitioners. The result is formulated as a comparative, process-level architecture for converting data into insight.

We contend that patent infringement litigation is characterized by industry and geographic specificity that affect (disproportionately) revenue generation and costs and, therefore, its net effect on firm profitability.

However, forecasting efficiency tends to fail when complex data is used. This paper proposes the use of ordered weighted average (OWA) operators in combination with ordinary least squares (OLS) to create an estimator that can treat high degrees of uncertainty. In the application of the ARCH-GARCH models, we develop approaches with the OWA and the induced OWA operator. Some further generalizations are also developed by using generalized means.

Traditional DEA models measure technical (radial) efficiencies by assuming the input and output status of each performance measure is known, and the data associated with the performance measures are non-negative. These assumptions are restrictive and limit the applications of DEA to real-world problems. We propose a new extended non-radial directional distance model, which is a variant of the weighted additive model, to cope with negative data. We then extend our model and use flexible measures, which play the role of both inputs and outputs, to cope with the unknown status of the performance measures.

One emerging strategy to sell the premium module, known as the virtual selling strategy, is to set the module price based on an amount of virtual currency that players can either spend on playtime to earn or use real currency to buy. In this paper, we examine how the virtual selling strategy leads to different market outcomes than the traditional real selling strategy where players can purchase the premium module using real currency only. We focus on the differences caused by one specific feature—players can pay for the module indirectly using their playtime in the virtual selling strategy. We show that when the provider’s efficiency of monetizing players’ playtime, that is, the time revenue rate, is above a threshold, the virtual selling strategy will benefit the provider and hurt the overall consumer surplus compared with the real selling strategy, even though players in the virtual selling strategy have one additional way, that is, using their playtime, to pay for the module. We identify an undocumented overcompensation effect that causes the profit augmentation and the surplus reduction. The overcompensation effect also results in a U-shaped relationship between the equilibrium module price and the time revenue rate in the virtual selling strategy when the module only provides a small number of new gaming stages. It contradicts the traditional result from the real selling strategy that the provider shall reduce the module price when she becomes more efficient in monetizing players’ playtime.

What is often neglected is other factors that contribute to a customer's overall experience like customisation and flexibility of deliveries, especially in cases when a customer's needs and plans change between order placement and order delivery. This paper explores the value of a flexible type of logistics offering in which the customer is able to change the order requirements (such as delivery date) after the order has been placed. In particular, we focus on the interactions between a retailer and a customer in agreeing and executing such logistics orders. We examine the benefits of this type of flexible logistics offerings because flexibility and customisation are critical factors for the success of omni-channel commerce. Such offerings are clearly connected with recent developments in digital technologies as these technologies are essential for the implementation. Our results indicate that flexible logistics offerings can be beneficial both for retailers and for customers. They also highlight the importance of receiving orders that do not fully meet the requirements of a customer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","e-commerce; Flexibility; Logistics; Omni-channel; Retailing","Sales; Service industry; Critical factors; Customisation; Delivery dates; Delivery service; Digital technologies; Low costs; Retail industry; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091037757

In some companies, up to 75% of all productivity gains are the result of bottom-up employee ideas. In this paper, we examine how employee interplant assignments—short problem-solving jobs at other manufacturing plants within the same firm—influence employee-driven manufacturing innovation. Using unique idea-level data from a large European car parts manufacturer, we show that interplant assignments significantly increase the value of employees’ improvement ideas due to the short-term transfer of production knowledge and long-term employee learning. Both effects are amplified by assignments to plants that have high functional overlap (i.e., plants producing similar products using similar processes and machinery). One implication is that, for the purpose of employee-driven manufacturing innovation, assignments between peripheral plants with high functional overlap can be more effective than assignments to and from central plants. These findings are robust to several econometric tests. Our study provides novel and detailed empirical evidence of manufacturing innovation, and goes beyond previous research on the learning curve (learning by doing) by investigating how interplant assignments affect the value of employees’ improvement ideas (learning by moving). © 2020 The Author(s)","Employee innovation; Employee mobility; Frontline innovation; Interplant assignment; Manufacturing innovation; Operational and conceptual learning","Automobile manufacture; Industrial research; Machinery; Personnel; Productivity; Car parts; Learning by doing; Learning curves; Manufacturing innovation; Manufacturing plant; Productivity gain; Shop floor; Short term; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105336534

The solution approach is initiated with a heuristic that runs in polynomial time. The approach then adds separation cuts to a relaxed version of the MIP formulation and updates the bounds until an optimal solution has been found. A real case and simulated realistic cases are used to compare the proposed model against the first-come first-serve (FCFS) policy that is traditionally used in vessel scheduling.

Purpose Recognizing a continuum of forms of engagement, this study focused on identifying lessons for optimizing patient partnerships, wherein engagement is characterized by shared decision-making and practice improvement codesign. Methodology Twenty-three semistructured interviews with providers and patients involved in improvement efforts in seven U.S. primary care practices in the Academic Innovations Collaborative (AIC). The AIC aimed to implement primary care improvement, emphasizing patient engagement in the process. Data were analyzed thematically. Results Sites varied in their achievement of patient partnerships, encountering material, technical, and sociocultural obstacles. Time was a challenge for all sites, as was engaging a diversity of patients. Technical training on improvement processes and shared learning ""on the job""were important. External, organizational, and individual-level resources helped overcome sociocultural challenges: The AIC drove provider buy-in, a team-based improvement approach helped shift relationships from providers and recipients toward teammates, and individual qualities and behaviors that flattened hierarchies and strengthened interpersonal relationships further enhanced ""teamness.""A key factor influencing progress toward transformative partnerships was a strong shared learning journey, characterized by frequent interactions, proximity to improvement decision-making, and learning together from the ""lived experience""of practice improvement. Teams came to value not only patients' knowledge but also changes wrought by working collaboratively over time. Conclusion Establishing practice improvement partnerships remains challenging, but partnering with patients on improvement journeys offers distinctive gains for high-quality patient-centered care. Practice Implications Engaging diverse patient partners requires significant disruption to organizational norms and routines, and the trend toward team-based primary care offers a fertile context for patient partnerships. Material, technical, and sociocultural resources should be evaluated not only for whether they overcome specific challenges but also for how they enhance the shared learning journey.

However, companies still struggle to sell refurbished products for different reasons ranging from consumer's attitudes towards refurbished products to in-efficient pricing policies adopted by remanufacturing and manufacturing companies due to the lack of understanding of the actual market of refurbished products. This impacts the profitability of the remanufacturing industry on a large scale. This paper aims to discuss the importance of understanding the market of the refurbished product and the role of consumer purchase behavior. With an emphasis on the refurbished cellphone market, this study has run a survey analysis to test several hypotheses about consumer's viewpoint toward refurbished electronics and identify marketing strategies that may benefit promoting the sale of refurbished consumer electronics in the market. The survey analysis results suggest that consumers’ willingness to pay for refurbished cellphones depends on the degree of the technological obsolescence of the product. Consumer's willingness to purchase refurbished cellphones is higher for more technologically obsolete products.

Local multiplier effects of tourist spending, which can potentially promote business growth even where leakage is high, have also received little attention. We demonstrate an approach for estimating these local economic effects from an iterative set of surveys tracing the flow of tourism money near South Luangwa National Park, Zambia, and synthesize results with qualitative and quantitative analyses of national multiplier effects, park finances, local perceptions, and the park's management history. Despite high leakage, tourism accounts for ~40% of local household income and at least half of business growth in the gateway community.

One approach is to posit that nature selects a worst-case distribution for any relevant stochastic primitives from some pre-specified family. Several communities have observed that a subtle phenomena known as time inconsistency can arise in this framework. In particular, it becomes possible that a policy which is optimal at time zero may not be optimal for the associated optimization problem in which the decision-maker recomputes her policy at each point in time, which has implications for implementability. If there exists a policy which is optimal for both formulations, we say that the policy is time consistent, and the problem is weakly time consistent. If every optimal policy is time consistent, we say that the problem is strongly time consistent. We study these phenomena in the context of managing an inventory over time, when only the mean, variance, and support are known for the demand at each stage. We provide several illustrative examples showing that here the question of time consistency can be quite subtle. We complement these observations by providing simple sufficient conditions for weak and strong time consistency. Although a similar phenomena was previously identified by Shapiro for the setting in which only the mean and support of the demand are known, here our model is rich enough to exhibit a variety of additional interesting behaviors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Base-stock policy; Dynamic programming; Inventory; Moment constraints; Multistage distributionally robust optimization; News vendor; Rectangularity; Supply chain management; Time consistency","Decision making; Stochastic systems; Implementability; Inventory control policies; Inventory models; Model misspecification; Moment constraints; Optimal policies; Optimization problems; Time inconsistency; Inventory control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089581146

This study proposes a bibliometric data-driven analysis from the literature to illustrate a clear overall concept of SSCF that reveals hidden indicators for further improvement.

Findings: The results show that blockchain, cash flow shortage, reverse factoring, risk assessment and triple bottom line (TBL) play significant roles in SSCF. A comparison of the challenges and gaps among different geographic regions is provided in both advanced local perspective and a global state-of-the-art assessment. There are 35 countries/territories being categorized into five geographic regions. Of the five regions, two, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa, show the needs for more improvement, exclusively in collaboration strategies and financial crisis. Exogenous impacts of wars, natural disasters and disease epidemics are implied as inevitable attributes for enhancing the sustainability.

One of the major verticals that has recently begun to effectively use IoT technologies is the retail industry. Given the unprecedented opportunities IoT generates for brands and retailers, it is important to glean timely insights regarding the business value of IoT and understand whether the introduction of an IoT technology as an alternative purchase channel for consumers affects the sales of physical products. In this paper, using empirical data from a multinational online retailer that adopted an IoT technology that largely automates consumers' purchases and a quasiexperimental framework, we study the effect of the introduction of IoT on product sales. Our analyses reveal a statistically and economically significant increase in sales as a result of adopting an IoT technology and demonstrate the business value of the IoT channel for retailers and brands. In addition, we conduct analyses of the IoT phenomenon to also delve into the effect heterogeneity and empirically validate the underlying mechanism by examining the impact of IoT for products in different price ranges, levels of substitutability, and product categories (e.g., search versus experience goods and hedonic versus utilitarian), drawing on mental accounting and automaticity theory. For instance, our analyses reveal that less expensive and more differentiated products as well as experience and utilitarian goods can accrue higher benefits leveraging more effectively novel IoT technologies. We validate the robustness of our findings using an extensive set of robustness checks and falsificationtests. This is thefirst paper to study the impact of an IoTtechnology onproduct sales, drawingimportant theoretical andmanagerialimplications andseedingnewfuture research directions for devices and technologies largely automating the purchase process.

Extant research has examined behavior-based price discrimination (BBP) that is, how firms set different prices for repeat and new customers. This research extends the literature by investigating behavior-based quality discrimination to reveal the unique effects of quality discrimination beyond the effects of BBP. Academic/ practical relevance: This research is relevant to the marketing-OM research/practice community because product feature or service provision is critical for firms. As technology advances, firms could offer product features or services with different quality levels and prices based on consumers' purchase histories. Researchers need to understand whether, how, and why behavior-based quality discrimination differs from BBP. Managers need to know whether they should reward repeat or new customers with higher quality (product features or services) or lower prices. Methodology:We use a two-period dynamic game-Theoretic model. In the first period, firms collect consumers' purchase history data. In the second period, they use these data for quality and price discrimination. Results: We find that behavior-based quality discrimination is fundamentally different from BBP. BBP intensifies competition in the second period but softens competition in the first period. By contrast, we find that behavior-based quality discrimination reduces competition in the second period but intensifies competition in the first period. We show two new mechanisms: First, firms use quality discrimination to soften second-period price competition by making competitive poaching more costly. Second, quality discrimination increases repeat purchase and customer retention. Anticipating this effect, firms reduce prices in the first period to attract more customers. Managerial implications: We show that managers should reward new customers on the price dimension by offering them a discount and reward repeat customers on the quality dimension by providing them with higher-quality product features or services. Managers should also understand that customer retention will increase with quality discrimination. Therefore, they need to reduce first-period prices to acquire customers and build up their customer base. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

SPMS are particularly valuable in sectors characterized by high complexity and variability of supplier performance, such construction. In projects with public sector buyers, regulations can constrain the development of comprehensive SPMS and the establishment of long-term perspectives on buyer-supplier relationships, and the impact of performance measurement practices are less well understood. To explore whether and how control and commitment can be achieved through structured use of SPMS in the public sector, this paper investigates the impact of a systematic approach to supplier performance measurement on project performance (i.e. cost, time, and quality), and how these effects are mediated by commitment. These relationships are tested using structural equation modeling on dyadic survey data collected from both suppliers and public buyers in 206 construction infrastructure projects in Italy. Results show that more rigorous qualification and performance evaluation processes have a positive impact on project performance, whereas this is not the case for supplier selection processes. Supplier commitment has a positive mediating role on the relationship between performance evaluation and project performance, while buyer commitment negatively mediates the impact of a more rigorous qualification process. These findings inform our understanding of the trade-off between control and commitment, focusing on public buyer-supplier relationships in construction projects. They demonstrate the differential relevance of SPMS to final performance across phases of the contracting cycle, and the contrasting impact of buyer and supplier commitment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Commitment; Construction; Performance measurement; Supplier relationships","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Sales; Buyer supplier relationship; Infrastructure project; Performance measurements; Relationship commitments; Structural equation modeling; Supplier performance measurement; Supplier relationships; Supplier selection process; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098620755

This pattern is an expression that oil prices deviate from their fundamentals, thereby forming the so-called speculative bubbles. However, this pattern requires a sophisticated econometric tool to capture its episodes. In this paper, we use the novel double recursive algorithm of Phillips and Shi (2018) to detect and analyze possible occurrences of speculative bubbles in oil prices in three key regional markets, including the European Union (Brent), Asia (Dubai), and the United States (WTI). Using the available monthly data ranging from January 1982 to October 2020, the results suggest two episodes of common bubbles to all oil prices, occurring in July 1986 and March–July 2008. The Dubai oil price is the most affected by the bubbles. Further, political events, oil supply shocks, and global economic activity are the main factors contributing to this bubble behavior. We also provide policy implications of the findings, which should help policymakers make suitable decisions related to monitoring oil price shifts and their possible causes. Besides, by explaining the bubbles’ episodes, investors can be cognizant of any factors that lead to such oil market failures, which should help in avoiding them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brent oil price; Dubai oil price; Price bubbles; WTI oil price","Commerce; Costs; Investments; Public policy; Bubble behavior; European union; Global economic activity; Oil supply shocks; Policy implications; Political events; Recursive algorithms; Regional markets; Crude oil price; algorithm; econometrics; economic activity; European Union; global economy; oil supply; policy making; price determination; price dynamics; Brent; Dubai [United Arab Emirates]; England; London [England]; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098456374

Utilizing a sample of early-stage high technology ventures in incubators, we find weak ties help improve performance when utilized as a source of assistance in certain learning domains, but reduce performance when utilized as a source of help in other learning areas. The relationship between customer learning activities and employee growth is strengthened by entrepreneurs' reliance on weak ties for help with customer learning. On the other hand, the relationship between financial learning activities and employee growth is weakened by entrepreneurs’ reliance on weak ties for help with financial learning. By accounting for the complex interplay between both content (domain learning activity) and process attributes (tie reliance for learning), the paper contributes by developing and testing a theoretical framework more capable of explaining the dynamics of entrepreneurial learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Entrepreneur; Entrepreneurial learning; Incubator; Network reliance; Startups; Strong ties; Technology ventures; Weak ties","Personnel; Domain learning; Dynamic learning; High technology; Impact performance; Improve performance; Learning Activity; New venture performance; Theoretical framework; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097480752

In the US, women constitute 13% of the mining workforce and 16% of mining related college programs. Similar trends exist globally. Efforts are being made by educational institutions, mining companies and professional organizations to attract women to the industry to achieve a gender inclusive industry. Such efforts have yielded minimal dividends partly due to insufficient reliable data on challenges confronting female miners. To provide empirical data to guide such efforts, we undertook a survey to understand the reasons for low female participation in the industry with participants from Ghana, USA, Ireland, Canada and other countries. The survey sought to identify challenges faced by female mining stakeholders and availability of support facilities for handling these challenges. Open and closed ended questionnaires were administered through online platforms. The responses were analyzed quantitatively using summary statistics and qualitatively using thematic analysis. About 38% of the respondents expressed satisfaction with their current jobs. The high dissatisfaction rate stems from lower salaries compared to male counterparts (29%), gender-based discrimination (53%), sexual harassment (37%) and sexual demands during hiring (17%). The key hindrances to a gender inclusive mining sector have been grouped into seven themes including discrimination, harassment, gender ideologies, and lack of support.

The possibilities of analyzing this so-called Big Data to inform research and the decision-making process are virtually endless. In general, analyses have to be done across multiple data sets in order to bring out the most value of Big Data. A first important step is to identify temporal correlations between data sets. Given the characteristics of Big Data in terms of volume and velocity, techniques that identify correlations not only need to be fast and scalable, but also need to help users in ordering the correlations across temporal scales so that they can focus on important relationships. In this paper, we present AMIC (Adaptive Mutual Information-based Correlation), a method based on mutual information to identify correlations at multiple temporal scales in large time series. Discovered correlations are suggested to users in an order based on the strength of the relationships. Our method supports an adaptive streaming technique that minimizes duplicated computation and is implemented on top of Apache Spark for scalability. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation on the effectiveness and the scalability of AMIC using both synthetic and real-world data sets. © 2015 IEEE.","adaptive sliding window; Apache Spark; big data; correlation; mutual information; Spatio-temporal data; streaming","Big data; Decision making; Scalability; Time series; Adaptive information; Adaptive streaming; Comprehensive evaluation; Decision making process; Multiple data sets; Mutual informations; Quantitative information; Temporal correlations; Information theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096821094

Prior work suggests that an increase in patient volume in a hospital service is associated with reduced costs per patient in that service. However, it is unclear how volume changes in one service affect the costs of the other services in the same hospital. This paper investigates such volume-cost spillover effects between elective and emergency admissions and across specialties, using condition-level panel data comprising all acute hospital trusts in England over a period of 10 years. We provide evidence that increased elective volume at a hospital is associated with an increase in the cost of emergency care (a negative spillover). Furthermore, for emergency admissions, we find evidence that increased emergency activity in one specialty is associated with lower costs of emergency care in other specialties (a positive spillover). By contrast, we find no evidence of spillover effects across specialties for elective admissions. We discuss the implications of these findings for individual hospital growth strategies and for the regional organization of hospital systems.

We study a critical question faced by such firms in the novel context of multicategory two-sided platforms: how to optimally make investment decisions across two sides, multiple categories, and different time periods to achieve fast and sustainable growth. We first develop a two-category two-period theoretical model and propose optimal resource allocation strategies that account for heterogeneous within-category direct and indirect network effects and cross-category interdependence. We find that the proposed strategy shares the spirit of the allocation rules for multiproduct nonplatform firms and single-product platform firms, yet it does not amount to a simple combination of the existing rules. Interestingly, the business model that platforms adopt crucially determines the optimal strategy. Platforms that charge by user should adopt a “reinforcing” rule for both within- and cross-category allocations by allocating more resources toward the stronger growth driver. Platforms that charge by transaction should also adopt the reinforcing rule for within-category allocation, but follow a “compensatory” rule for cross-category and intertemporal allocations by allocating more resources toward the weaker growth driver. We use data from the daily deals industry to empirically identify the network effects, propose alternative allocation strategies stemming from our theoretical findings, and use simulations to show the benefits of these strategies. For instance, we show that reallocating 10% of the average observed investment from Fitness to Beauty can increase profits by up to 15.5% for some cities.

Forecasting of spare parts demand has been researched through both parametric and non-parametric approaches. However, little has been contributed in this area from a Bayesian perspective, and most of such research is built around the Poisson demand distributional assumption. However, the Poisson distribution is known to have certain limitations and, further, empirical evidence on the inventory performance of Bayesian methods is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian method based on compound Poisson distributions. The proposed method is compared to the Poisson-based Bayesian method with a Gamma prior distribution as well as to a parametric frequentist method and to a non-parametric one. A numerical investigation (on 7400 theoretically generated series) is complemented by an empirical assessment on demand data from about 3000 stock keeping units in the automotive sector to analyse the performance of the four forecasting methods. We find that both Bayesian methods outperform the other methods with a higher inventory efficiency reported for the Poisson Bayesian method with a Gamma prior. This outperformance increases for higher demand variability. From a practical perspective, the outperformance of the proposed method is associated with some added complexity. We also find that the performance of the non-parametric method improves for longer lead-times and higher demand variability when compared to the parametric one. © Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian method; Empirical investigation; Forecasting; Intermittent demand; Inventory","Bayesian networks; Forecasting; Poisson distribution; Compound Poisson distribution; Gamma prior distribution; Inventory efficiency; Inventory performance; Nonparametric methods; Numerical investigations; Parametric and non-parametric approaches; Spare parts inventories; Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093961876

Third, there is a lack of clarity as to how IoT public policy should be developed. In this paper we argue that new IoT policy should be guided by key stakeholder values (i.e. what users think to be important). We utilize the Public Value Forum to elicit public values to inform decision-making surrounding IoT policy by public administrators, conceptually informed by Rational choice theory.

Buyers’ valuations for an item depend on the context that describes the item. However, the seller is not aware of the relationship between the context and buyers’ valuations (i.e., buyers’ preferences). The seller’s goal is to design a learning policy to set reserve prices via observing the past sales data, and her objective is to minimize her regret for revenue, where the regret is computed against a clairvoyant policy that knows buyers’ heterogeneous preferences. Given the seller’s goal, utility-maximizing buyers have the incentive to bid untruthfully in order to manipulate the seller’s learning policy. We propose learning policies that are robust to such strategic behavior. These policies use the outcomes of the auctions, rather than the submitted bids, to estimate the preferences while controlling the long-term effect of the outcome of each auction on the future reserve prices. When the market noise distribution is known to the seller, we propose a policy called contextual robust pricing that achieves a T-period regret of O(d log(T d) log(T)), where d is the dimension of the contextual information. When the market noise distribution is unknown to the seller, we propose two policies whose regrets are sublinear in T. © 2020 INFORMS","Online advertising; Pricing; Repeated second-price auctions; Robust learning; Strategic buyers","Commerce; Sales; Contextual information; Learning policy; Long-term effects; Noise distribution; Robust learning; Second-price auction; Strategic Behavior; Strategic buyers; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101388283

On the other hand, the output of the Geographic Information System (GIS) model includes one or more actual locations, which satisfy all needs. It provides points related to the BIM tool and it creates a 3D model for visualizing the optimum location. Integration of GIS and BIM can bring about several advantages including optimum locating. The aim of the current study is to propose a useful model for locating warehouses in large manufacturing factories using a BIM-GIS integrated model. To this end, BIM was used for simulation and locating of product warehouses in the casting unit of Esfahan’s Mobarakeh Steel Company (EMSC) in Iran. In order to meet these aims, several locations were selected in the EMSC compound, and decision making regarding three superior alternatives which were carried out by creating a 3D model of the warehouse and fitting of the model in three suggested locations. Using the extant literature, interviews with experts and managers, and survey questionnaires, essential criteria affecting the optimum locating of industrial warehouses were extracted based on the Building information modeling data. Then, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used for data analysis. The results indicated that among various criteria, economic–social and crisis management criteria had the highest weights.

Our approach can be applied at no incremental cost by using routine repeated cross-sectional customer survey data collected by firms. The IV approach addresses multiple sources of biases that pose challenges in estimating the causal effect using cross-sectional data: (1) the upward bias from common-methods variance resulting from the joint measurement of service satisfaction and loyalty intent in surveys, (2) the attenuation bias caused by measurement errors in service satisfaction, and (3) the omitted variable bias that may be in either direction. In contrast to the common concern about the upward common-methods bias in estimates using cross-sectional survey data, we find that ordinary-least-squares substantially underestimates the causal effect, suggesting that the downward bias resulting from measurement errors and/or omitted variables is dominant. The underestimation is even more significant with a behavioral measure of loyalty, where there is no common-methods bias. This downward bias leads to significant underestimation of the positive profit impact from improving service satisfaction and can lead to underinvestment by firms in service satisfaction. Finally, we find that the causal effect of service satisfaction on loyalty is greater for more difficult types of services.

However, when private benefits from energy efficiency exceed the social benefits, there is an incentive for the consumers to over-invest in energy efficiency; otherwise, there is an incentive to under-invest. This study adds to this discussion by providing an empirical estimation of the electricity savings and social benefits after energy efficiency retrofits for consumers on time-of-use (TOU) and increasing block pricing, respectively. We aim to examine how social versus private savings from a given energy efficiency measure may be different depending on different pricing plans. This study applies hourly electricity data for about 16,000 residential consumers during 2013–2017 in Arizona. We show that for the TOU consumers, the private savings from energy-efficient AC retrofits are greater than the social savings by 61%, while the increasing block rate consumers’ private savings exceed the social savings by 46%, when other market failures are not considered (e.g., principal-agent problem and imperfect information). Different rate plans impose different marginal electricity prices which influence the incentives to invest in energy efficiency as well as electricity consumption behaviors that can influence both the private and social savings from energy efficiency. The result indicates that there should be potentially different levels of policy interventions towards energy efficiency for consumers on different pricing. Additionally, we also find that energy efficiency makes the electricity demand more elastic to price changes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Energy efficiency; Increasing block rate; Price elasticity; Private benefits; Social benefits; Time-of-use","Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Retrofitting; Electricity demands; Electricity-consumption; Empirical estimations; Imperfect information; Marginal electricities; Policy intervention; Principal-agent problems; Residential consumers; Energy efficiency; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; estimation method; incentive; Arizona; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096058533

This longstanding question has doggedly eluded a conclusive answer due to conflicting empirical findings. We revisit two studies that have been central to rejecting short-termism: Atanassov (2013) and its replication by Karpoff and Wittry (2018). After revising some of the empirical choices by Atanassov (2013), we find the opposite result: antitakeover laws that insulate managers from the market for corporate control enhance innovation, driven by firms with significant ownership by short-term oriented investors. However, antitakeover laws do exacerbate the pursuit of value-destroying acquisitions. Our findings highlight corporate governance as a strategic variable that imposes a tradeoff in disciplining different agency conflicts and weak governance as a necessary evil to stimulate innovation. Managerial Summary: We present evidence that shareholder pressure indeed exacerbates short-termism and stifles innovation, especially in firms with significant ownership by short-term oriented investors. One key implication is that calls to reduce managerial entrenchment and hold managers more accountable to shareholders warrant careful consideration. While curbing other forms of agency conflict, such as managerial shirking and the pursuit of value-destroying acquisitions, such reforms can exacerbate the myopic focus on short-term profits and prevent long-term value creation. Our findings warn that it is misleading to look for universally “good” governance. There are multiple forms of agency conflict that require diametric prescriptions, and designing corporate governance should carefully consider the tradeoffs based on a firm's ownership structure and the need for innovation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons LLC.","corporate governance; innovation; institutional ownership; replication; short-termism","Investments; Shareholders; Corporate control; Corporate governance; Empirical findings; Ownership structure; Short term; Strategic variables; Term value; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089311564

This service provides an advanced, timely, personalized, and flexible responses to the demand of the PTS, especially of commuters. Obviously, it could have an impact on public transport (PT) service. For instance, CB services influence the customers' variety-seeking behavior, which results in changes of customer options in different periods. Therefore, customers could be divided into different groups of preference. In this paper, we construct a two-period Hotelling game model by variety-seeking behavior and service level. The results show that, in the first stage, the departure frequency of CB and PT is influenced by variety-seeking behavior and service level. In the second stage, departure frequency is influenced by service level only. Next, although the departure frequency of bus impacts the changes of passenger ratios in different stages, service level appreciably impacts passenger number. From customer surplus and social welfare, we find that adjustment of service level can increase social welfare, which means that CB and PT will reach an optimum effect. The present work can provide a valuable reference to policymakers, practitioners, and others. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Customized bus; Operational strategy; Public transport; Service level; Two-stage model; Variety-seeking behavior","Buses; Departure frequency; Different stages; Innovative models; Operational strategies; Passenger numbers; Public transport; Public transport systems; Service levels; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088517366

With the advancement of global green development, green finance has paved the way for the government to respond to the challenges of climate change by providing mature financial services, appropriate financing, investment, and project funds related to environmental protection. In this context, green finance was proposed, and the relationship between green finance, renewable energy, and carbon emissions in the BRICS countries from 2000 to 2018 was further studied based on the quantile regression model. The presence of cross-sectional dependence in panel results is tested through CD and LM methods. The findings show the negative effect of green finance and non-fossil energy consumption on CO2 emissions. Furthermore, economic growth, trade openness, energy consumption, and foreign direct investment increase the CO2 emissions.

We use monthly series of 7 advanced countries, namely the US, UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, and Italy and 2 different indices for measuring financial stress (FSI) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU), over the period 2007–2020. Furthermore, the literature on oil price uncertainty and its effect on financial stress and on economic policy uncertainty is scarce. We additionally, examine the impact of oil price volatility on FSI and on EPU, by employing a structural VAR-GARCH-M model specification and IRFs analysis. Our results from the dynamic connectedness analysis indicate that during the COVID-19 pandemic, spillovers have increased substantially but not exceeded the Global Financial Crises 2007 levels. Finally, our estimation results from the IRFs analysis reveal that oil price uncertainty is associated with higher financial stress for some of the G7 countries while it is not related to economic policy uncertainty. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Economic policy uncertainty; EPU; Financial stability; FSI, financial stress; GARCH-M; Impulse responses; Oil price shock; Pandemic; Spillovers","Binary alloys; Commerce; Economic analysis; Financial markets; Investments; Planning; Potassium alloys; Specifications; Uncertainty analysis; Uranium alloys; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Financial stability; Financial stress; FSI, financial stress; GARCH-M; Oil price shocks; Pandemic; Spillover; Uncertainty; Value engineering; economic policy; financial market; oil production; price dynamics; pricing policy; uncertainty analysis; Canada; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118885992

However, an important question arises in this increase in online shopping and resulting deliveries: How long will this last? Very little is known whether this popularity would last a long time. To address this question, the authors conducted a survey of 915 individuals residing in the U.S. and classified them into the four distinctive consumer types (i.e., the prior adopter, temporary adopter and permanent new adopter, and non-adopter) depending on their usage of delivery services before, during, and after (expected) the COVID crisis. This research aims to gain behavioral insight by exploring the differences between the four consumer types and investigating factors affecting the initial adoption and continuance intention of using delivery services. The descriptive analysis revealed that there are clear differences not only between the four types of consumers but also between the four product types (i.e., grocery, food, home goods, and other packages) considered in the survey. The models found that factors affecting the initial adoption and continuance intention are different from the previous studies conducted before the COVID pandemic.

A novel method is developed to identify the factors contributing to uncertainty in shipbuilding first-tier suppliers that inhibit the effective and efficient delivery of ETO products. The empirical data set comes from case-specific workshops involving cross-disciplinary staff from engineering, production, purchasing, planning and sales. The protocol included presentations by the researchers and the company, tours of the shopfloor and interactive sessions. The latter used ‘brown-paper’ exercises to map customer penetration-point locations, identify where uncertainties occurred and evaluate their impact-likelihood. The customer penetration-point mapping identified two ETO types; redesign-to-order (RTO) and innovate-to-order (ITO). The major challenges faced by ITO systems are caused through failures in (a) properly understanding customer requirements and translating those to product specification, (b) providing capacity and capability in engineering design teams at both first- and second-tier suppliers, (c) managing interfaces from customer through to second-tier suppliers. Engineering processes in RTO systems have poor customer configuration protocols leading to complex, overengineered products without pre-existing bill of materials. Engineering and production processes at both first- and second-tier RTO suppliers have extended lead-times with poor capacity availability. A change programme is suggested to reduce uncertainty requiring primary consideration of process and control aspects before addressing demand-side and then supply-side changes. The findings are evaluated by independent interviews indicating that the method and tools adopted have validity, and that the findings are commensurate with wider industry expectations. © 2021 The Authors","Complexity; Innovate; Redesign; Soft systems; Uncertainty","Product design; Shipbuilding; Ships; Shipyards; Supply chains; Complexity; Customer penetration; Engineer to orders; Engineering process; Innovate; Ordering system; Penetration point; Redesign; Soft systems; Uncertainty; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109079106

Several explicit production axioms are introduced to build a production possibility set. New models are developed based on the production possibility set and a frontier projection procedure with the production scale matching process. Unlike the existing approach which assumes the intermediate measures are free-setting decision variables, the new envelopment network DEA models project the intermediate measures of a unit using the radial projection technique. Correspondingly, the resulting multiplier network DEA models allow for weight flexibility on the intermediate measures while holding a total value flow equivalence between a unit's two stages. We show that our approach does not suffer the known network DEA pitfalls. It identifies the overall efficiency, divisional efficiencies, and frontier projection using either an envelopment or a multiplier network DEA model, i.e., the primal-dual correspondence holds in our approach. Our approach also avoids uncertainties in determining divisional efficiencies by generating a unique pair of divisional efficiencies for each unit.

Most of this literature focuses on CE initiatives related to material recovering and recycling. The body of knowledge about reusing components is limited and mostly related to the need for reusing rather than providing solutions on how to reuse components. Modularization can be a step towards a solution, enabling entire modules or their components to retain their functionality in other infrastructures. Leveraging 23 semistructured interviews with nuclear and oil and gas experts, mainly based in the UK and US with international experience, this paper deals with the link between modularization and CE (defined modular CE) to identify enabling factors and barriers for the reuse of modules or their components. Relevant enabling factors are the monitoring of module and component conditions, standardization of module and component designs, and early planning. Relevant barriers are the lack of a second-hand market, economics, and regulatory challenges.

Such a two-person and zero-sum matrix game with probabilistic linguistic information is a useful technique for multiple criteria analysis. In addition, it outputs the same form of information as the inputs to increase the interpretability compared with other uncertain matrix games.

In this study, we examine how product characteristics and the type of information provider jointly impact purchase decisions in a social network setting. We first propose an analytical observational learning framework integrating the impact of product differentiation and social ties. Then, we use two experimental studies to validate our analytical results and provide additional insights. Our key findings are that the effect of learning from strangers is stronger for vertically differentiated products than for horizontally differentiated products. However, the effect of learning from friends does not depend on whether the underlying product is horizontally or vertically differentiated. What is more interesting is the nuanced role of social ties: For horizontally differentiated products, the effect of learning increases with the strength of social ties. In addition, contact-based tie strength is more important than structure-based tie strength in accelerating observational learning. These findings provide motivation for online retailers to generate alternative strategies for increasing product sales through social networks. For example, online retailers offering horizontally differentiated products have strong incentives to cooperate with social media platforms (e.g., Instagram and Pinterest) in encouraging customers to share their purchase information. © 2021 INFORMS","Multidimensional observational learning; Product differentiation; Social ties","Electronic commerce; Social networking (online); Differentiated products; Experimental evidence; Multidimensional observational learning; Observational learning; Online retailing; Product differentiation; Social media platforms; Social network theory; Social ties; Tie strengths; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104653914

One of the main debates is identifying the side or negative effects of the sharing economy as well as its positive effects. Studying the cause-effect relationship of the variables affecting sustainability in the sharing economy context can provide valuable results for firms. For this purpose, fuzzy cognitive maps have been used. Based on the literature review, the sharing economy's essential variables that affect sustainability were identified, and using the Fuzzy Delphi method, these variables were localized. Snapp and Tap30 were selected as two of the largest platforms in the Iranian transportation sector. Fuzzy cognitive maps based on aggregated opinions of experts were inputted to the Mental Modeler online software to drawn the cognitive map of this research. The degree of centrality index, i.e., the summation of input and output degree, was used to identify the most relevant sustainability variables. Consequently, the incentives to make a greater use of the platform, the income of drivers, the monopoly power of platforms, the price of services, the higher service quality of platforms, the use of private vehicles by passengers, and the change of traffic in cities were identified as variables with the greatest effect on stability. Four positive loops and one negative loop were identified among these seven variables in the cause-effect analysis. In the final section, some suggestions are presented based on each loop. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy cognitive mapping; Fuzzy delphi method; Sharing economy; Sustainability; Transportation sector","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Fuzzy rules; Mapping; Sustainable development; Academic community; Cause-effect relationships; Cognitive maps; Fuzzy cognitive mappings; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Literature reviews; Localised; Online software; Sharing economy; Transportation sector; Cognitive systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106574413

In the past, many researchers proposed recommendation models based on collaborative filtering or matrix factorization from the perspectives of time, geography, and social relationship. However, only a few studies have focused on user preference which is the key factor influencing user decision. This work focuses on studying the representation and mining of user preference from check-in data for POI recommendation. Pair-wise ranking is the common solution for implementing preference learning. However, traditional ways of constructing pair-wise data cut off the connections between multiple options in the decision process, affecting the effectiveness of preference learning. In this work, we change the ratio of negative to positive instance in pair-wise data from 1:1 to k:1 to ensure the data construction in line with the real decision making process. We propose a new negative sampling method taking the geographical distance and POI categorical distance into consideration jointly for enhancing the quality of training data. For our specialized pair-wise data, we propose a new optimization criterion for implementing effective preference learning. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experiment results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 19.7% on F1-Score and 24.4% on nDCG.

This meritorder effect of renewables displacing incumbent conventional (e.g., gas) generation forms the theoretical underpinning for investment decisions and policy in the power industry. This paper uses a game-theoretic market model to investigate how intermittently available wind generation affects electricity prices in the presence of forward markets, which are widely used by power companies to hedge against revenue variability ahead of near-realtime spot trading. We find that in addition to the established merit-order effect, renewable generation affects power prices through forward-market hedging. This forward effect reinforces the merit-order effect in reducing prices for moderate amounts of wind generation capacity but mitigates or even reverses it for higher capacities. For moderate wind capacity, uncertainty over its output increases hedging, and these higher forward sales lead to lower prices. For higher capacities, however, wind variability conversely causes power producers to behave less aggressively in forward trading for fear of unfavorable spotmarket positions. The lower sales counteract the merit-order effect, and prices may then paradoxically increase with wind capacity despite its lower production cost. We confirm the potential for such reversals in a numerical study, suggesting new empirical questions while providing potential explanations for previously contradictory observed effects of market fundamentals. We conclude that considering the conventional merit-order effect alone is insufficient for evaluating the price impacts of variable renewable generation in the presence of forward markets. © 2021 INFORMS.","Cournot competition; Electricity markets; Forward trading; Renewable energy","Commerce; Electric utilities; Game theory; Investments; Electricity prices; Investment decisions; Ordering effects; Renewable generation; Renewable Power; Renewable power generation; Wholesale electricity; Wind variabilities; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112127923

Relevant corporate decisions concern a broad range of factors and require novel analytical models for critical control. This study conducts mathematical analyses to identify the factors that are vital yet receiving insufficient attention from researchers and practitioners. Valid survey observations were collected from 113 enterprises in China, the biggest emerging economy that faces the dilemma between development and sustainability. Grey relational analysis (GRA) and interpretative structural modeling (ISM) assess the importance levels of contextual and organizational factors and explore their joint effects. Validated with conventional expert interviews, the results prioritize the factors that play crucial roles in sustainable supply chains. In particular, enterprises should pay close attention to three factors: corporate collaboration, clean production and supplier selection, which provide useful clues on the best practices of formulating low-carbon decisions. With a better understanding of critical factors, enterprises may make supply chains more sustainable with limited resources. To enhance the generalizability of findings, future studies may collect more observations from multiple countries and validate the results in the settings of global supply chains. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Grey relational analysis (GRA); Interpretative structural model (ISM); Low-carbon decisions; Sustainable supply chain","data interpretation; decision making; model validation; numerical model; questionnaire survey; supply chain management; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098643557

It proposes a two-sector dynamic spatial growth model that incorporates the relation between economic activity, carbon emissions and temperature. The model is taken to the data at the 1° by 1° resolution for the entire world. Over a 200-year horizon, rising temperatures consistent with emissions under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 push people and economic activity northwards to Siberia, Canada and Scandinavia. Compared with a world without climate change, clusters of agricultural specialization shift from Central Africa, Brazil and India's Ganges Valley, to Central Asia, parts of China and northern Canada. Equatorial latitudes that lose agriculture specialize more in non-agriculture but, due to their persistently low productivity, lose population. By the year 2200, predicted losses in real GDP and utility are 6% and 15%, respectively. Higher trade costs make adaptation through changes in sectoral specialization more costly, leading to less geographic concentration in agriculture and larger climate-induced migration. © The Author(s) (2021).","Geography; Global warming; Growth; Migration; Sectoral specialization; Trade","air temperature; carbon emission; economic activity; economic geography; economic growth; global trade; global warming; migration; numerical model; quantitative analysis; specialization; Canada; Scandinavia; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118955968

While some industries have successfully utilized WSDs, such as smart personal protective equipment (PPE), to track data related to health, fitness, or even location, the construction industry has been relatively slow in implementing WSDs. Although some progress is expected, construction management research is yet to provide clear evidence of the impact of WSDs on vital project and organizational performance metrics such as safety and productivity. To fill this gap, the present study established the first WSD success model using multiple complementary frameworks and theories. The success model comprises individual adoption factors that influence individual WSD use and highlights implementation success indicators needed to evaluate adoption success. It was tested using survey questionnaires retrieved from 415 users of WSDs in the United States. Test results indicate the success model was a good fit. Moreover, findings suggest a strong positive relationship between the use of WSDs and individual performance, and project performance. This hybrid model provided critical insights on the impact of WSDs on workers' performance, project metrics, as well as essential information for supporting the increased adoption of WSDs. It is believed that this framework will also guide construction practitioners in the effective integration of WSDs into their work processes. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction safety monitoring; Construction technology; Safety management; Safety performance; Success model; Wearable technology","Construction equipment; Construction industry; Protective clothing; Surveys; Wearable technology; Adoption factors; Construction management research; Implementation success; Individual performance; Organizational performance; Personal protective equipment; Project performance; Safety measurements; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104953014

This research tests the impact of different combinations of stimuli (information and space management) on the selection of healthier products. Methodology: Through a within-between subjects on-line experiment, a set of hypotheses relating different combinations of information provision (communication) and space management (shelf display) were tested for two different product categories: cereal bars and breakfast cereals. The sample comprised 249 participants within the UK. Findings: Results show that there is no single unique solution to encourage healthy food choices.

We joined all relevant channels on two popular group-messaging platforms, Telegram and Discord, and identified thousands of different pumps targeting hundreds of coins. We find that pumps are modestly successful in driving short-term price rises, but that this effect has diminished over time. We also find that the most successful pumps are those that are most transparent about their intentions.

This study, therefore, is focused on assessing the environmental and economic impacts of activities linked to jasmine rice production. The study compares organic and conventional jasmine rice production to promote sustainable farming alternatives. Purposive and snowball sampling was chosen to identify the sample and forty-nine face-to-face interviews were conducted with local farmers engaged in the rice production in Thung Kula Rong Hai, a north-eastern region in Thailand. We applied the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method to measure the environmental impact. In addition, Life Cycle Costs (LCC) was used to study jasmine rice production costs. The study found that even though the Green-House-Gas (GHG) emissions of organically cultivated areas was higher than the conventional cultivated areas, this was due to the higher absorption of organic matter in the soil. This is beneficial in the long run as our findings show that organic jasmine rice paddy resulted in higher yields. Therefore, economically organic rice production emerged as a better alternative than the conventional method when compared between yield, costs and profits of jasmine rice production. Our results also demonstrate how post-harvest management is an important hotspot in sustainable farming practices. Thus, our findings promote sustainable agriculture practices in Thailand that can help them to cope up with climate change issues (e.g. droughts) and ultimately contributing to the food security goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental management; Jasmine rice production; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costs; Organic agricultural system","Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Farming practices; Food security; Jasmine rice; Jasmine rice production; Organic agricultural system; Organics; Production life; Rice production; Sustainable Farming; Thailand; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104491876

We examine flood insurance uptake using household level survey data and employ instrumental variables (related to local history of aid distribution and political economy) to address endogeneity of individual expectations of eligibility for disaster assistance. To avoid potential problems with reverse causation, we drop any households that could have received payments in the past (triggering mandatory flood insurance purchase). We find coastal households that exhibit positive expectations of disaster aid eligibility are 25 to 42 percent less likely to hold flood insurance.

In particular, the model uses individual socio-demographics, built environment variables, as well as psycho-social variables (in the form of latent psychological constructs) as determinant variables to explain likely AV impacts on five dimensions of short-term activity-travel choices: (1) Additional local area trips (that is, those that would not characterized as long distance trips; a long distance trip was defined in the survey as a trip more than 75 miles one-way), (2) Trip distance to shop or eat-out activities in the local area, (3) Trip distance to leisure activities in the local area, (4) Additional long distance road trips beyond the local area, and (5) Commute travel time. The model system includes a confirmatory factor analysis step, a multivariate linear regression model for the latent constructs, and a multivariate ordered-response model for the five main outcomes just listed. Data from a 2019 Austin area survey of new mobility service adoption and use forms the basis for our empirical analysis. Our results, when aggregated across all respondents, does suggest that AVs may not after all have a substantial impact on overall trip-making levels, although local area trips are likely to become longer (for all purposes, including the commute). The highest impact of AVs will, it appears, be on the number of long distance trips (with such trips increasing). Our in-depth examination of the variations in AV activity-travel responses across population segments and geographies underscores the importance of modeling multiple activity-travel dimensions all at once. In addition, our results highlight the value of using psycho-social latent constructs in studies related to the adoption/use of current and emerging mobility services, both in terms of improved prediction fit as well as proactive strategies to design equitable, safe, and community-driven AV systems. There is likely to be considerable heterogeneity in how different population groups view and respond to AVs, and it is imperative that AV campaigns and AV design consider such heterogeneity so as to not “leave anyone behind”. © 2021","Activity-travel; Autonomous vehicles (AVs); Design; Equity; Long distance travel; Policy; Safety","Autonomous vehicles; Design; Factor analysis; Regression analysis; Surveys; Travel time; Activity-travel behavior; Analytics systems; Autonomous vehicle; Autonomous Vehicles; Equity; Local areas; Mobility service; Multiple dimensions; Trip distances; Vehicle impact; Accident prevention; design; empirical analysis; road transport; transportation policy; transportation safety; travel behavior; unmanned vehicle; Austin [Texas]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105689884

We find that female managers motivate greater female worker productivity than male managers by engaging in subordinate scut work, the practice of voluntarily getting one's hands dirty to perform subordinates' routine tasks, which increases subordinates' engagement with their work. Our qualitative data help to generate hypotheses that we explore using personnel data on individual productivity and test causally using a laboratory-in-the-field experiment in which we randomly assign workers to supervisors and experimentally manipulate supervisors' ability to perform subordinate scut work. This paper contributes to the literature on motivating worker productivity by drawing attention to the important role of manager gender and by studying a less-researched organization context - that of a female-dominated workplace. The paper also contributes to the literature on women in management by investigating their impact on worker performance, measured objectively, and uncovering subordinate scut work as a specific managerial practice that female managers can use to foster engagement with work and improve female worker productivity. © 2020 INFORMS.","Gender; Manager; Worker productivity","Garment industry; Managers; Productivity; Female workers; Field experiment; Individual productivity; Managerial practices; Qualitative data; Worker productivities; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101218993

Adopting the context of Chinese FDI in a set of 24 African nations during 2006–2017, we first separate structural change from total factor productivity (TFP) to obtain the technological progress series. We then account for spatial dependence in technological progress across countries by employing various spatial models; of these, the Spatial Durbin Model is found to best describe our data. We find that, first, both structural change and technological progress have contributed positively to TFP in Africa. Thus, the latter captures the pure technological change more accurately than TFP does. Second, Chinese FDI in Africa has had a positive and significant effect on the region's technological progress, whilst non-Chinese FDI (mainly from developed countries) has not, substantiating our expectation of stronger technological benefit for developing economies when FDI is from other developing nations. Finally, there had been negative spatial technological dependence across countries, implying a competitive rather than cooperative relationship among African nations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Africa; China; Outward FDI; Spatial models; Structural change; Technological progress","Commerce; Developing countries; Cooperative relationships; Developed economies; Developing economies; Foreign direct investments; Spatial Durbin models; Technological change; Technological progress; Total factor productivity; Investments; developing world; foreign direct investment; market development; spatial analysis; structural change; technological development; total factor productivity; Africa; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100063729

But the managerial implications of such freemium content offerings are not well understood. We, therefore, utilized microlevel user activity data from the New York Times to conduct a large-scale study of the implications of digital paywall design for publishers. Specifically, we use a quasi-experiment that varied the (1) quantity (the number of free articles) and (2) exclusivity (the number of available sections) of free content available through the paywall to investigate the effects of paywall design on content demand, subscriptions, and total revenue. The paywall policy changes we studied suppressed total content demand by about 9.9%, reducing total advertising revenue. However, this decrease was more than offset by increased subscription revenue as the policy change led to a 31% increase in total subscriptions during our seven-month study, yielding net positive revenues of over $230,000. The results confirm an economically significant impact of the newspaper’s paywall design on content demand, subscriptions, and net revenue. Our findings can help structure the scientific discussion about digital paywall design and help managers optimize digital paywalls to maximize readership, revenue, and profit. © 2020 INFORMS","Content demand; Digital paywall; News media; Quasi-experiments; Subscription-based models","Management; Operations research; Advertising revenues; Business models; Large-scale studies; Managerial implications; On-line contents; Policy changes; Quasi-experiments; User activity data; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105298583

Ecological research on mutualistic ecosystems (such as plant-pollinator networks) has found a connection between high values of nestedness, a unique linkage distribution strategy, and effective resource utilization. The present work is the first to test the benefits of nested architectures for IS goals, a characteristic thus far overlooked in bio-inspired IS efforts. A generated large dataset of hypothetical-realistic Industrial Water Networks spanning the entire nestedness domain shows that highly nested designs significantly reduce resource consumption. Circumstances where these savings outweigh any additional infrastructure and operation costs are also shown, highlighting that low to moderate resource abundance and manageable geographical dispersion between participating industries (conditions that commonly generate interest in IS) are particularly favorable for nested architectures. Ecologically-similarly nested IS networks, especially those with highly connected high-throughput industries, are also found to have a reduction in negative impacts during pipeline disruptions. The results provide promising evidence that the principle of nestedness can be a powerful quantitative bio-inspired design guideline for IS, capable of simultaneously addressing environmental, economic, and resiliency concerns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-inspired design; Eco-industrial parks; Industrial symbiosis; Nestedness; Resilience; Sustainability","Architecture; Biomimetics; Industrial emissions; Large dataset; Network architecture; Bio-inspired designs; By-product exchange; Distribution strategies; Geographical dispersions; Industrial symbiosis; Resource abundance; Resource consumption; Resource utilizations; Industrial economics; economic development; economic growth; industrial development; sustainability; sustainable development; symbiosis; Article; controlled study; cost; cost control; financial management; industrial symbiosis; industrial symbiosis network; industrial water network; industry and industrial phenomena; operational cost; pipeline; sustainable development; symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100115958

A firm's supplier monitoring activities (SMA) are, thus, central to achieving supply chain transparency. In an effort to help build a business case for SMA, this research explores the effect of SMA disclosures on consumers' attitude toward the firm and purchase intention. In so doing, we also examine how consumer attitude and purchase intention vary as a function of SMA disclosure characteristics. The results of three behavioral studies reveal more positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention when a firm discloses that its supplier monitoring extends to lower-tier suppliers (SMA depth) and the firm monitors its lower-tier suppliers directly rather than relying on its first-tier suppliers or third parties to do so (lower-tier supplier monitoring mechanism). Greater SMA breadth—monitoring both suppliers' social and environmental activities—in turn, is not associated with more positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention. Further, attitude toward the firm mediates the relationship between SMA disclosure characteristics and purchase intention. Collectively, these findings underline that consumers value firms' SMA and point toward an economic rationale for a firm's transparency regarding its supplier monitoring efforts. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","behavioral issues; experimental vignette studies; social responsibility; supplier monitoring; sustainability","Economic and social effects; Purchasing; Sales; Supply chains; Transparency; Behavioral studies; Business case; Consumer attitudes; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Monitoring activities; Monitoring mechanisms; Purchase intention; Social and environmental; Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097551268

However, most prior work has lacked focus on studying their usage during disasters in the Global South, where Internet access and social media usage differs from developing countries. In this paper, we study social media use in the aftermath of the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico on the 19th of September, 2017 (known as the #19S earthquake). We conduct an analysis of how participants utilized social media platforms in the #19S aftermath. Our research extends investigations of crisis informatics by (1) examining how participants used different social media platforms in the aftermath of a natural disaster in a Global South country. (2) Uncovering how individuals developed their own processes to verify news reports using an on-the-ground citizens approach. (3) Revealing how people developed their own mechanisms to deal with outdated information. For this, we surveyed 356 people. Additionally, we analyze one month of activity from Facebook (12,606 posts), Twitter (2,909,109 tweets), Slack (28,782 messages), and GitHub (2602 commits). This work offers a multi-platform view on user behavior to coordinate relief efforts, reduce the spread of misinformation, and deal with obsolete information which seems to have been essential to help in the coordination and efficiency of relief efforts.

However, no approach has been developed to holistically quantify and optimize the carbon reduction/economic costs trade-off for the modular construction supply planning (MCSP). This paper introduces a two-period based equilibrium strategy that fully considers the procurement-prefabrication-assembly logistics optimization to determine an economic costs/environmental impact balance in modular construction. The proposed methodology is capable of optimizing the preparation and construction schemes and dynamic transportation arrangements under multiple carbon-economy preference scenarios. By employing uncertain parameters to account for the material and delivery cost fluctuations, the model can accurately depict the industry characteristics of modular construction supply. A case study from Florida is then conducted to validate the practicality and robustness of the equilibrium strategy. The applications indicate that the proposed methodology can assist the construction enterprises to systematically reduce carbon emissions and serve as decision support for modular construction supply planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon-economy equilibrium; Modular construction supply; Two-period dynamic model","Carbon; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Modular construction; Uncertainty analysis; Construction enterprise; Construction scheme; Construction supply; Equilibrium strategy; Industry characteristics; Logistics optimization; Transportation arrangements; Uncertain parameters; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099401142

We analyze the effects of content generated by human brands (referred to as human brand generated content) on a popular social media platform, Twitter, on audience engagement. The first objective of this study is to examine the effects of positive and negative tone of human generated content on social media engagement. Next, we study the impact of popularity of human brands on the effect of tone on audience's engagement. Building on the arguments of perception spillover effects, we also investigate the effects of content generated by related human brands on the engagement of the focal human brand. Set in the context of the 2014 Indian general election, we find that both positive-toned content and negativetoned content have a positive effect on social media engagement. We find that the popularity of a human brand negatively moderates the relationship between positivetoned content and engagement. Our findings indicate interesting spillover effects of content created by related brands on the effectiveness of content created by a focal human brand. In particular, we find evidence for presence of the reinforcement effect, that is, the effect of negative tone on engagement is greater when the tone of related human brands is negative and the engagement is higher when the tones of both the focal human brand and related brands are positive. However, we find that the effect of negative-toned tweets of a focal human brand is lower when the tone of related human brands is positive. Our analyses account for endogeneity issues, correlated unobservables, and reflection problem. We supplement our core results with additional analyses that include alternative model specifications, alternative samples, estimation strategies, and engagement metrics. We present implications of this study to practice and the literature on social media content.

Focusing on the mindsets of readers in their perception process, our research explores the impact of online reviews from the perspective of construal level theory. We find that, even for the same review, readers with a high (vs. low) construal level report more perceived concreteness and thus more perceived usefulness.

They usually lead to more sales, which may increase consumer surplus and firm profit. In this paper, we ask whether the firms’ choice of recommender system might hurt consumers. We use data from a large-scale field experiment in video-on-demand to measure the price elasticity of demand for movies placed in salient and non-salient slots on the TV screen. During this experiment, the firm randomized the prices and slots in which movies were recommended to consumers. This setting readily allows for identifying the effects of price and slot on demand, and thus computes consumer surplus. We find that consumers are less price-elastic toward movies placed in salient slots. Using the outcomes of this experiment, we simulate how consumer surplus and welfare change when the firm implements several types of recommender systems, namely one that maximizes profit. We show that this system hurts consumer surplus and welfare relative to a system that maximizes welfare. We also show that, in our setting, the system that maximizes profit does not generate less consumer surplus than several recommender systems frequently used in practice. Yet, the amount of extra rent the firm can extract from strategically placing movies in salient slots is still a function of the popularity and quality of movies used to do so. Ultimately, our results question whether recommender systems embed mechanisms that extract excessive surplus from consumers, which may call for better scrutiny. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

Not only is the role difficult but also sales jobs are often marked by high levels of stress, rejection, and burnout. Thus, salesperson resilience is critical. However, a gap remains in our understanding of how resilience influences performance and how managers can motivate salespeople to be more resilient. To answer these questions, we collected survey data from 110 salespeople from a large firm based in the Midwest, along with objective effort and performance data provided by the company prior to and following a poor performance review. Our analyses reveal that intrinsically motivated salespeople are more resilient than salespeople driven by a desire for financial compensation. In addition, resilience leads to sales performance through increasing two types of effort—both initiating more calls with customers and achieving longer average call duration. Hence, our findings demonstrate that resilient salespeople not only persevere but also become better at selling in the process. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Intrinsic motivation; Perseverance; Personal selling; Resilience; Sales",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096338302

To explore the economic feasibility of the bio-based monomers as a potential replacement for the commercial petro-counterpart, this study presents a conceptual process design and scale-up of SBMs production. Process simulation was conducted by Aspen Plus through an integrated design consisting of the catalytic transesterification conversion of soybean oil/soybean oil-based biodiesel with N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEAA), followed by product recovery optimization with solvents recycling solutions. The simulation tool estimated mass and energy balances and assessed plant performance under varying process conditions (different renewable content, catalysts, soybean oil-based feedstocks, and scales). The minimum selling price (MSP) of SBM in the base case was estimated to be $78.4/kg using a cash flow analysis, which shows its economic potential compared to stearyl acrylate. The renewable content of the specialty chemical is a key technical parameter for MSP while it contributes to carbon emission reduction as well. Carbon abatement cost analysis indicates trivial economic impact of feedstock and the need for abatement consideration in different environmental profiles for bio-based chemicals. The uncertainty analysis showed the price of the fossil-based component – HEAA has the major impact on the MSP, while feedstock to HEAA ratio, tax rate, interest rate, and capital cost are sensitive parameters.

The centralized, decentralized and cooperative game-theoretic decision models are developed, analyzed and compared for a generic consignment supply chain with complementary products under O2O mode. Similar models are also developed for that under pure online- and offline-channel modes for comparison purpose. The corresponding numerical and sensitivity analyses are conducted to validate the analytical findings and derive managerial insights. It is found that the cooperative strategy always creates many more profits for the supply chain by setting a much lower retail price and generating much more demands than those of the decentralized strategies. The best supply chain strategy for a consignment supply chain with complementary products sold through both online and offline channels is identified as the cooperative strategy. An extensive sensitivity analysis of seven key parameters on an O2O cooperative decision model has derived several insightful findings for the O2O consignment supply chain practitioners with complementary products. These managerial insights will facilitate better decision-making for the O2O retailers and their complementary suppliers. Since the cooperation of a consignment supply chain under O2O mode with complementary products is a fresh research domain, there are more research issues to be explored. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Complementary products; Consignment supply chain; Cooperative strategy; Online to Offline Business Mode (O2O Mode); Revenue sharing contract","Decision making; Game theory; Managers; Sensitivity analysis; Business mode; Complementary products; Cooperative game; Cooperative strategy; Decision modeling; Revenue sharing contracts; Supply chain cooperation; Supply chain strategy; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079466172

First, when industry IT usage is high, a firm's inventory leanness is more responsive to information inputs (cash holding and sales efficiency). Second, when industry IT usage is high, the price-to-earnings ratio (indicative of stock market investors' willingness to pay a premium) is more sensitive to the firm's inventory leanness. Design/methodology/approach: This study highlights the contextual role of industry IT usage during the 1998–2009 lost decade (wherein the steepest falls in manufacturing jobs happened in the USA). Findings: The results highlight the significant contextual role of industry IT usage. In manufacturing industry sectors with high IT usage, (1) inventory levels of firms are more responsive to information inputs and (2) stock market investors have greater appreciation for inventory leanness. Originality/value: The lost decade, 1998–2009, was a difficult period for the manufacturing industry. Nonetheless, there was variation in stock market valuations of manufacturing firms, with many firms outperforming others. Stock market investors were sensitive to inventory leanness.

Decisions for managing such resources impact not only the environment but also influence the economic productivity of FEW sectors and the well-being of society. Therefore, while algorithms can be used to develop optimal solutions under various criteria, it is essential to explain such solutions to the community. More importantly, the community should accept such solutions to be able realistically to apply them. In our collaborative computational framework for decision support, machines and humans interact to converge on the best solutions accepted by the community. In this framework, trust among human actors during decision making is measured and managed using a novel trust management framework. Furthermore, such trust is used to encourage human actors, depending on their trust sensitivity, to choose among the solutions generated by algorithms that satisfy the community's preferred trade-offs among various objectives. In this paper, we show different scenarios of decision making with continuous and discrete solutions. Then, we propose a game-theory approach where actors maximize their payoff regarding their share and trust weighted by their trust sensitivity. We run simulations for decision-making scenarios with actors having different distributions of trust sensitivities. Results showed that when actors have high trust sensitivity, a consensus is reached 52% faster than scenarios with low trust sensitivity. The utilization of ratings of ratings increased the solution trustworthiness by 50%. Also, the same level of solution trustworthiness is reached 2.7 times faster when ratings of ratings included. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Food–Energy–Water management; Game theory; Trust management; Trustworthy Human–Machine systems","Computation theory; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Game theory; Water management; Collective decision making; Computational framework; Decision supports; Different distributions; Economic productivity; Human actor; Optimal solutions; Trust management frameworks; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098709139

However, given the high expenditure involved in the deployment of these systems, the factors that will enable their successful integration should be thoroughly considered and assessed before these systems are adopted. Absorptive capacity (ACAP) is the ability of organisations to gather, absorb and strategically influence new external information, and as such, there is a strong theoretical connection between ACAP and BI systems. This research aims to empirically investigate the relationship between the dimensions underpinning ACAP (i.e. acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation) and whether and how they affect the efficiency of BI systems, which, in turn, can enhance organisational efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: This study formulates five hypotheses addressing the effect of ACAP dimensions on BI systems efficiency and the effect of BI systems efficiency on organisational efficiency. It synthesises previous qualitative work and current research to derive sets of measures for each of the key constructs of the study. It follows a quantitative methodology, which involves the collection of survey data from senior managers in the telecommunications industry and the analysis of the data using partial least squares – structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results of the analysis confirmed the validity of the constructs and proposed measures and supported all five hypotheses suggesting a strong positive relationship between the ACAP dimensions, acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation and the efficiency of BI systems and a strong effect of BI systems efficiency on organisational efficiency. Practical implications: The study offers a comprehensive model of ACAP and BI systems efficiency. The set of measures that underpin these constructs could help researchers understand how ACAP dimensions are practically implemented and could contribute to their efforts to develop ACAP measurement instruments. At the same time, the model can help managers assess the readiness of their firms to adopt BI systems and identify which areas should be further developed, before committing to the substantial financial investment associated with BI systems. It also provides a set of practical solutions that could be implemented to enable a more robust ACAP and support a better integration of BI systems. Originality/value: Following an empirical approach, this study refines one’s theoretical and practical understanding of ACAP as an organisational dynamic capability and its dimensions; it provides an account on how each dimension affects different aspects of BI systems efficiency, which, in turn, may contribute to the improvement of organisational efficiency. Moreover, the study reframes ACAP measures as a set of requirements that can be practically assessed and followed before attempting to purchase BI systems. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity (ACAP); Business intelligence (BI); Measures; Organisational efficiency; Partial least squares (PLS); Structural equation modelling (SEM)","Information analysis; Least squares approximations; Managers; Telecommunication industry; Business intelligence systems; Design/methodology/approach; External informations; Measurement instruments; Partial least square (PLS); Quantitative methodology; Structural equation modelling; Telecommunications industry; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094976739

However, underperforming suppliers may set impractical goals that are difficult to achieve in the short term due to the poor information analysis, which could cause benchmarking difficulties. Therefore, rather than focusing on a single ultimate goal, this paper developed an implementable goal sequence for which a dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis based benchmarking model was developed as a multi-period process. The indicators that could not be directly measured using numerical values were incorporated into the model as fuzzy numbers, and based on efficiencies, the suppliers were divided into several layers. A method that identified supplier attractiveness and progress was then introduced to select the most appropriate goal in each layer for the goal sequence. A numerical example is provided that illustrated the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method to successfully identify the inefficient suppliers and determine a goal sequence that had three attainable goals. The sensitivity analysis and comparisons revealed that the proposed model avoided selecting period-inefficient suppliers and provided a better benchmarking process. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Fuzzy data; Goal setting; Sustainability; Uncertain dynamic DEA","Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; Fuzzy sets; Numerical methods; Sustainable development; Benchmarking models; Benchmarking process; Fuzzy numbers; Goal setting; Multi-period; Numerical values; Short term; Uncertain dynamics; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089225320

For example, the Amgen cholesterol drug Repatha had an initial list price of $14,523 per year. Patients, even with insurance coverage, must pay out of pocket a significant portion of this price. The treatment might not be successful, and this possibility reduces risk-sensitive patients’ incentives to purchase the drug. The high price together with the chance of negative treatment outcomes may lead payers to deny coverage for the drug. Outcome-based pricing has been proposed as a way to reallocate the risks and improve both payer resource allocation and patient access to drugs. According to an outcome-based rebate contract between Amgen and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, if a patient on Repatha suffers a heart attack or a stroke, both patient and insurer are refunded the cost of the drug. We use a stylized model to analyze the effect of outcome-based pricing via rebates. Our model captures the interaction between heterogenous, price-sensitive, risk-sensitive patients who decide whether to purchase the drug; a payer deciding whether to provide coverage for the drug; and a price-setting pharmaceutical firm seeking to maximize expected profits. We find that, in many cases, a pharmaceutical firm and payer cannot simultaneously benefit from outcome-based pricing, and who will benefit is determined by the probability of treatment success. Outcome-based pricing thus appears unlikely to solve the issues of high drug prices and high payer expenditures. However, supplementing outcome-based pricing with a transfer payment from firm to payer can make payer and firm (but not necessarily the patients) better off than under uniform pricing when the drug has a low chance of success. © 2020 INFORMS.","Drug pricing; Healthcare; Pay-for-performance; Pharmaceuticals; Risk sharing","Economics; Insurance; Patient treatment; Cholesterol drugs; Expected profits; Insurance coverages; Pharmaceutical firms; Prescription drugs; Price sensitive; Transfer payment; Treatment outcomes; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100847801

A new paradigm usually necessitates a new framework to comprehend it fully, organise extant knowledge, identify gaps in knowledge, guide future research and practice, and synthesise new knowledge. Paradoxically, such a framework to guide the research and practice of ML in manufacturing remains absent. This paper attempts to fill this gap by presenting the interpretive model of manufacturing as an integrative framework for ML in manufacturing. A systematic hybrid literature review approach has been adopted to conduct both thematic and conceptual synthesis of the literature. The descriptive literature review method has been used to conduct a thematic synthesis of the literature. The framework synthesis method has been used to complete a conceptual synthesis of the literature. The resultant framework, the interpretive model of manufacturing, is articulated as consisting of scan, store, interpret, execute, and learn as its purposive components. Research questions have been identified for each of these components, as well as at their interfaces, to develop a comprehensive and systematic research agenda. Additional areas for extending research have also been identified.

In their accounts of discrimination, corruption, familial/domestic responsibilities, cultural perceptions of gender, and ingrained religious beliefs, participants draw attention to the intense difficulties they face in their careers. We highlight the significance of context and argue that Nigeria is notable for an extreme attitude of male preference at work involving an intensification of career barriers that reflects the entrenched and systemic nature of male dominance in Nigerian organizations. We capture this in the concept of the “hypermasculine organization,” which is characterized by exaggerated male advantage, a tendency towards gender-based exploitation and abuse together with a justificatory logic based on rigidly enforced gender roles. These debilitating factors affecting women in organizations have potential implications for other countries in the global south. © 2020 The Authors.

Leveraging signaling theory, we use 830 succession events from 2010 to 2017 to show that pay disparity between the CEO and the highest paid non-CEO executive is positively related to the likelihood of outside CEO succession. Thus, boards need to be aware of the implications of possible unintentional signals sent via executive compensation decisions. We do not find evidence of an interactive effect when compensation and CEO succession are co-managed using linking pin directors—directors with compensation and CEO succession responsibilities—but supplemental analyses suggest a positive main effect of linking pin directors on the likelihood of inside CEO succession. Managerial Summary: Powerful watchdog agencies assert that high pay differences between a firm's CEO and its next highest paid executive (CEO–HPE pay disparity) indicate succession planning challenges. This assertion has profound implications for stakeholders, but evidence supporting it is unclear. Our study examines the relationship between CEO–HPE pay disparity and the board's choice of an outside CEO, an indicator of ineffective succession planning. We find evidence that higher pay disparity signals an increased likelihood of choosing an outside CEO successor. We also find that boards who co-manage compensation and succession may be more likely to hire an inside CEO successor. Our findings suggest that boards need to understand how compensation decisions may be inadvertently signaling future CEO succession choices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CEO succession; executive compensation; executive pay disparity; signaling theory; top management teams","Planning; Chief executive officer; Empirical analysis; Executive compensation; Interactive effect; Linking pins; Main effect; Signaling theory; Succession planning; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089288634

These strategies have included, among others, restricting dispensing, introduction of prescribing guidelines, use of clinical audit, and performance reviews as well as strategies aimed at changing the prescribing behaviour of clinicians. However, behavioural interventions have had limited effect in optimising doctors’ antibiotic prescribing practices. This study examines the determinants of decision-making for antibiotic prescribing in hospitals in the NHS. A system dynamics model was constructed to capture structural and behavioural influences to simulate doctors’ prescribing practices. Data from the literature, patient records, healthcare professional interviews and survey responses were used to parameterise the model. The scenario simulation shows maximum improvements in guideline compliance are achieved when compliance among senior staff is increased, combined with fast laboratory turnaround of blood cultures, and microbiologist review. Improving guideline compliance of junior staff alone has limited impact. This first use of system dynamics modelling to study antibiotic prescribing decision-making demonstrates the applicability of the methodology for design and evaluation of future policies and interventions. © 2020 The Author(s).

The success of a churn management program depends on accurately identifying potential churners and understanding what conditions contribute to churn. However, in the presence of uncertainties in the process of churn, such as competing risks and unpredictable customer behaviour, the accuracy of the prediction models can be limited. To overcome this, we employ a competing risk methodology within a random survival forest framework that accurately computes the risks of churn and identifies relationships between the risks and customer behaviour. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed model does not rely on a specific functional form to model the relationships between risk and behaviour, and does not have underlying distributional assumptions, both of which are limitations faced in practice. The performance of the method is evaluated using data from a membership-based firm in the hospitality industry, where customers face two competing churning events. The proposed model improves prediction accuracy by up to 20%, compared to conventional models. The findings from this work can allow marketers to identify and understand churners, and develop strategies on how to design and implement incentives. © Operational Research Society 2020.","Competing risk; customer churn management; machine learning; random survival forest","Predictive analytics; Sales; Conventional models; Customer behaviour; Design and implements; Functional forms; Hospitality industry; Management programs; Prediction accuracy; Survival forests; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089172546

We trained machine learning models to predict which of them will result in corruption investigations, a breach of contract, or implementation inefficiencies. We then discuss how our models can help practitioners better understand the drivers of corruption and inefficiency in public procurement.

PLM seeks to enhance an organisation's ability to manage its product development activities and support collaboration across organisational functions and business units, and between organisations. Effective decision-making is vital for the successful management of products over their lifecycle. However, decision-making is an under-researched area in PLM. We argue that decision-making theory and group decision support concepts can be brought to bear to enhance PLM decision-making processes. We present and justify a set of six principles to support decision-making in a PLM context. The paper highlights the need to consider and capture decisions as distinct units of PLM knowledge to support product lifecycle management. We derive a generic information flow and a group decision support structure for PLM decision-making that encapsulates the six principles. Three industrial cases are analysed to illustrate the application and value of the principles in supporting decision-making. The principles enable PLM decisions to be codified, recorded, and reviewed. Decision-making processes can be reused where appropriate. The principles can support future innovations that may affect PLM, such as ontological and semantic reasoning and Artificial Intelligence. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decision analysis; decision support systems; knowledge reuse; PLM; Product lifecycle management","Decision support systems; Decision theory; Information management; Life cycle; Semantics; Decision making process; Decision-making theories; Group decision supports; Industrial organisation; Product development activities; Product life cycle management; Product lifecycle management systems; Successful management; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087372043

In this article, we present results that suggest people may disagree with themselves. Using eight decision-making contexts ranging in familiarity, complexity, and risk, we show that a nationally representative sample (n = 1874) of respondents made choices that were inconsistent across two complimentary methods of eliciting preferences. We show that on average individuals demonstrate higher levels of internal consistency, or alignment between their choices and their stated values and concerns, when decisions are ‘easy’, or simple, familiar, and have little risk. However, this consistency declines when people are confronted with difficult choices involving unfamiliar, complex contexts involving high risk. Moreover, providing additional and salient contextual information about alternatives, such as brand names, model information, or the specific components of a risk mitigation strategy, results in significantly lower levels of consistency when compared to situations where this information is withheld. This finding suggests that people rely on simplifying heuristics when making easy decisions; however, this kind of information is less influential when choices are difficult. Importantly, we show that higher levels of education also have a significant and positive association with the consistency of people’s choices. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","complexity; internal consistency; preferences; Risk; tradeoffs","Decision making; Risks; complexity; Contextual information; Internal consistency; Levels of consistency; preferences; Representative sample; Risk mitigation strategy; tradeoffs; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083606156

This paper analyzes lean manufacturing implementation at Estaleiro Atlântico Sul (EAS) a shipyard located in an underdeveloped region in northeastern Brazil. EAS was the recipient of multiple oil tanker contracts from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, but was unable to meet delivery deadlines and suffered cost overruns until a strong LM culture was introduced. From the EAS case, we make suggestions for a more appropriate lean manufacturing implementation in an emerging economy context.

Consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers can choose to deliver to nanostores either directly—visiting thousands of stores per day—or via wholesalers—saving on distribution cost but forfeiting the direct access to the store owners to develop demand. We study a manufacturer’s channel strategy within a finite time horizon. Academic/practical relevance: The channel strategy in emerging markets has both marketing and operational elements, which lead to a newly formulated problem with novel characteristics. High costs are involved in the nanostore distribution, and the difference in wholesale price, logistics cost, product availability, and market growth leads to a multidimensional problem that is not trivial to analyze. Methodology: We develop an analytical model to derive the optimal channel policy. We conduct a numerical study with parameters tuned by field data. We develop managerial insights based on our formal results and our numerical analysis. Results: The optimal channel policy structure depends mainly on two channel metrics: the gross profitability, which is the gross margin at a particular moment in time; and the growth-adjusted profitability, which includes the growth potential of a particular channel strategy to develop the market and realize future profits. With demand growth over time, we show that, in the optimal policy, there is at most one switch between the wholesale and direct-channel strategies within the time horizon. Managerial implications: Depending on the two metrics, it may be optimal to first expand the market by using the direct channel and then switch to the wholesale channel to exploit the expanded market. In other cases, it may be optimal to first expand the market slowly by using the wholesale channel and then switch to the direct channel to benefit from high demand growth. The optimal channel strategy is also dependent on the time horizon, with a longer time horizon leading to relatively longer use of the direct channel.

Ecotourism has a great impact on the development of a region from different perspectives. Hence, by improving and developing sustainable ecotourism in a region, it will be possible to develop and improve its economic, social, and environmental situation. The Lafour region is one of the potential hubs for ecotourism activities in Iran. Despite the high potential of this region for ecotourism activities, it has not yet achieved its suitable position in this domain. Hence, the main goal of this study is to develop sustainable goals for ecotourism in the region. To meet the target, first, the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT factors) are identified through interviews with tourists, local residents, and the experts, filed observation, and considering similar works in the literature review. Then, some practical and useful strategies are determined based on SWOT analysis and consulting with the experts. The important point of the study is proposing an applicable heuristic clustering method based on SWOT analysis to classify the strategies into different clusters. To prioritize the strategies in each cluster, the commonly used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method called the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is applied. This paper concludes and reveals that the three strategies including ST6 “Encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to establish ecotourism centers in the region”, ST5 “Establishing and improving the hygiene units and the medical clinics in the region”, and ST3 “Improving and diversifying tourism services and products to attract tourists and increase their satisfaction” have the greatest impact on accomplishing sustainable development goals in the region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering method; Lafour region; Sustainable ecotourism; SWOT analysis; TOPSIS","Cluster analysis; Decision making; Heuristic methods; Sustainable development; Clustering methods; Eco-tourisms; High potential; Lafour region; Local residents; Opportunities and threat (SWOT); Social and environmental; Sustainable ecotourism; SWOT analysis; Technique for order preference by similarities to ideal solutions; Ecology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119928086

For online portfolio selection, transaction costs incurred by changes of investment proportions on risky assets have a significant impact on the investment strategy and the return in long-term investment horizon. However, in many online portfolio selection studies, transaction costs are usually neglected in the decision making process. In this paper, we consider an adaptive online portfolio selection problem with transaction costs. We first propose an adaptive online moving average method (AOLMA) to predict the future returns of risky assets by incorporating an adaptive decaying factor into the moving average method, which improves the accuracy of return prediction. The net profit maximization model (NPM) is then constructed where transaction costs are considered in each decision making process. The adaptive online net profit maximization algorithm (AOLNPM) is designed to maximize the cumulative return by integrating AOLMA and NPM together. Numerical experiments show that AOLNPM dominates several state-of-the-art online portfolio selection algorithms in terms of various performance metrics, i.e., cumulative return, mean excess return, Sharpe ratio, Information ratio and Calmar ratio. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive moving average method; Decision support systems; Linear programming; Online portfolio selection; Transaction cost","Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; E-learning; Investments; Linear programming; Machine learning; Adaptive moving average method; Decision supports; Linear-programming; Net profits; Online portfolio selection; Online portfolios; Portfolio selection; Profit maximization; Support systems; Transaction cost; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103966971

Furthermore, it examines the impact of customers’ knowledge sharing attitude on the relationship between experiential value and customers’ information exchange behavior. Structural equation modeling was used to assess these dynamic relationships and provide a scalable measurement instrument that can be applied to gamified experiences ranging from simple customer-interface interactions, all the way up to multi-actor service ecosystems. Our findings support the notion that managers can use gamification to foster information exchange and thereby value co-creation between customers and employees directly, without necessarily having to change customers attitudes first. The findings also suggest that gamification can be applied successfully in cases of large groups of people with widely varying characteristics, backgrounds, and motivations. Additionally, our research indicates that experiential value is a suitable candidate for a consistent measurement instrument for gamification. This study is the first to apply a holistic experiential value approach to a gamified experience that simultaneously accounts for customers’ interactions with a multisensory physical environment, their personal interactions with employees, and their interactions with other customers. © 2021 The Authors","Experiential value; Gamification; Information exchange behavior; Knowledge sharing attitude; Multi-actor service ecosystem","Behavioral research; Ecosystems; Human resource management; Information dissemination; Sales; Customer information; Exchange behavior; Experiential value; Gamification; Information exchange behavior; Information exchanges; Knowledge sharing attitude; Multi actors; Multi-actor service ecosystem; Service ecosystems; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113777338

In this exploratory study, factors that can stimulate (technological propensity) or impede (financial constraints and entrepreneurial limits) the new social business ventures of young entrepreneurs were investigated through five operational variables tested using a questionnaire administered to 120 young graduate entrepreneurs in Tunisia. Analysis of the results revealed that business creators’ (e.g., young entrepreneurs’) potential decision to launch social business ventures is positively influenced by technological propensity but also constrained mainly by four eminent factors (lack of investment capital, scarce access to finance, lack of entrepreneurial skills, and aversion to risk). This research offers several implications at the scientific and managerial levels, inferring that although conceived to overcome possible public inefficiency in both emerging and established economies, social business entrepreneurship most likely still requires public support for operational sustainability. © 2021","Emerging economies; Entrepreneurial limits; Financial constraints; Social business; Technological propensity; Tunisia","Investments; Business enterprise; Business ventures; Developing economies; Emerging economies; Entrepreneurial limit; Financial constraints; Social business; Technological propensity; Tunisia; Tunisian experience; Economics; advanced technology; business; developing world; entrepreneur; young population; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113356135

In this paper, we consider overconfidence bias in a supply chain innovation scenario, which consists of an innovative upstream supplier and an overconfident downstream manufacturer overestimating the impact of innovation to enhance demand. We investigate the influence of the manufacturer's overconfidence on supplier innovation and supply chain profits under the wholesale price contract and the cost-sharing contract settings. Our results suggest that while the overconfidence is detrimental to the supplier's innovation under a wholesale price contract, it is beneficial to the supplier's innovation under a cost-sharing contract, and even more beneficial than in the centralized case. We also find that, under a wholesale price contract the manufacturer's profit can be higher than under a cost-sharing contract when the level of overconfidence exceeds a certain threshold. Interestingly, we further find that the supplier's unawareness of overconfidence benefits both biased supply chain members under a wholesale price contract but shows the opposite effect for a cost-sharing contract. Our results offer insights into overconfidence bias in operations management and provide practical decision-making advice for supply chain members. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-sharing contract; Overconfidence; Overestimation; Upstream innovation; Wholesale price contract","article; cost; decision making; human; human experiment; price; profit",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108623172

Rather than the existing project-centric prediction methods, we propose a novel backer-centric prediction method. We identify each backer's preferences based on their pledge history and calculate the cosine similarity between backer's preferences and the project as each backer's persuasibility. Finally, we aggregate all the backers' persuasibility to predict project success. To validate our method, we crawled data on 183,886 projects launched during or before December 2014 on Kickstarter, a crowdfunding website. We selected 4,922 backers with a total of 442,793 pledges to identify backers' preferences. The results show that a backer is more likely to be persuaded by a project that is more similar to the backer's preferences. Our findings not only demonstrate the efficacy of backers' pledge history for predicting crowdfunding project success but also verify that a backer-centric method can supplement the existing project-centric approaches.

However, under price-based demand-response programs, uncoordinated load shifting among many customers may lead to rebound peaks, thus incurring financial costs on the energy service provider (ESP). This study addresses this issue from both the ESP (utility company) and customer's perspectives in a two-step approach. First, each customer solves a local multi-objective load scheduling problem. Thereafter, the ESP solves a system-wide demand profile optimization problem. More precisely, we formulate in the first step a multi-objective optimization model to minimize consumption costs and load schedule discomfort while considering multiple energy sources and customer preferences. In the second step, we design an approach that combines Pareto-optimal solutions from all customers and minimizes their aggregate demand profile's peak-to-average ratio (PAR). Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the equivalent single-objective optimization models, and it can reduce the PAR metric by up to 11%. In other words, the proposed approach successfully improves the ESP's system-wide demand profile aggregation while reducing customers’ expenses and discomfort. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Demand-side management; Microgrids; Multi-objective optimization; Prosumers; Smart grids","Demand side management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Pareto principle; Sales; Smart power grids; Demand response; Demand response programs; Energy services; Microgrid; Multi-objectives optimization; Peak to average ratios; Price-based; Prosumer; Service provider; Smart grid; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116327509

Apart from some positive sign of this boost, several other issues have also been developed in the region. One of such issues is the safety of workers at the construction sites. This article, based on a variety of applications of drones in other industrial sectors, considers the use of drones for construction safety improvement in the GCC countries. This article aimed to investigate the safety-related applications of drones considering technical features and barriers and enablers for safety-related tasks. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed research approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted to achieve the aims and objectives of this research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review, semistructured interviews and using a structured questionnaire. A total of 37 relevant research items and 10 interviews were held with construction safety professionals, and 92 responses collected from the safety managers through a structured questionnaire was used to derive the conclusion of this research. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. Descriptive analyses were carried out in which means and importance factors were calculated. Findings: 25.92% of participants confirmed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. The most common application of drones reported by the respondents was photography for marketing purposes followed by surveying application and quality inspections. The camera movability was the top-rated technical feature required for safety-related inspections. Similarly, “Working near the corner or edge of unprotected opening” was the top-rated application of drone for safety-related tasks. The safety concerns of using drones at job sites were rated as the most important barrier by the participants. Technical challenges associated with the use of drones for safety improvement was rated as the second most important barrier by the participants. Research limitations/implications: Although, the research presented in this article is based on the GCC construction industry, however, since the data collected through systematic review and semistructured interviews are not a regional base, therefore the finding of this research could also be useful in other regions. Further research however, needs to be conducted to reduce the implications of the barriers identified in this paper so that the drone can be effectively used for safety improvement in construction not only in the GCC region but also in other countries. Practical implications: Once the GCC construction industry will be able to overcome the challenges associated with the application of drones in safety improvement, the safety managers will be able to monitor the site more effectively which could be helpful to improve the safety performance of the construction organization. Social implications: Improved safety performance in not only in the greater interest of the construction organizations as they can reduce the costs associated with poor safety but can also avoid the delay caused by construction accidents. Similarly, improved safety performance reduces the accidents at construction sites, and thus reduces injuries and disabilities caused by such accidents, making the construction workers a useful part of the society. The application of drones in safety-related tasks is one of the key solutions that can lead us to improved safety performance. Originality/value: Although, the use of drone technology has revolutionized a number of industrial sectors due to its variety of applications, the application in construction particularly in the GCC region is still very limited. As noted in the results of this research, only 21 participants (25.92%) expressed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. This means that the industry is not getting the full advantage of the available drone technology. The results of this research will enable construction industry stakeholders to know the challenges associated with the application of drones for safety improvement and to develop strategies to overcome these challenges. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Construction planning; Construction safety; International practice; Management project management","Accidents; Construction industry; Drones; Inspection; Managers; Occupational risks; Surveys; Construction accidents; Construction organizations; Construction workers; Design/methodology/approach; Gulf Cooperation Council; Product and services; Semi structured interviews; Systematic literature review; Accident prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097030623

Academic/practical relevance: Limited access to resources for the development of an advanced version adds another wrinkle to this problem, particularly for cash-constrained start-ups. For such start-ups, the introduction of an on-hand product can generate additional funds to support the development of an advanced product. However, the lower performance of the on-hand product can negatively impact the perception of the firm’s future products and lower future profitability. Methodology: We study the trade-off between revenues that an on-hand product generates for research and development funding and the negative effect it has on future profits. We characterize the optimal introduction timing of the on-hand product as a function of the financial resource constraints, the interdependence between these sequential products and the cost of development. Results: We identify important differences between the optimal product introduction strategies of a start-up and an established firm. Specifically, although it is always optimal for an established firm to accelerate the launch of a better-quality on-hand product, a start-up might find it optimal to delay its launch. The impact of technological failure and different forms of learning on the optimal strategy of the start-up are also explored. We translate our analytical findings into a managerial framework and illustrate these results using examples from the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries. © 2020 INFORMS","Entrepreneurial operations; New product development; Sequential innovation; Start-up","Economic and social effects; Profitability; Canonical products; Delay product; Entrepreneurial operation; Established firms; Innovative product; New product development; Problem definition; Product introduction; Sequential innovations; Start-up; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120421881

We find a causal treatment effect of 37 installations per municipality from the campaigns and no evidence of harvesting or persistence. The intervention also lowers installation prices. Randomized controlled trials based on the intervention show that selection into the program is important, whereas group pricing is not. Our results suggest that the program provided economies of scale and lowered consumer acquisition costs, leading to low-cost emission reductions. © 2021 INFORMS","Natural experiment; Nonprice interventions; Renewable energy; Social learning; Solar photovoltaic panels; Technology adoption","Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Group pricing; Large-scales; Natural experiment; Nonprice intervention; Renewable energies; Social interactions; Social learning; Solar photovoltaic panels; Solar photovoltaics; Technology adoption; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118133233

These models typically operate as either (i) a trade-in and resale program, wherein a firm offers a trade-in discount on a new product and resells the traded-in products, or (ii) a P2P resale marketplace where customers can buy and sell used products to each other. Since different firms choose different resale strategies, it is not clear which strategy is more profitable. Furthermore, although firms that adopt each resale model also promote their environmental benefits, there are concerns that these firms are greenwashing, that is, misrepresenting the environmental benefits of their business models. Hence, we investigate the profitability and environmental impacts of these resale marketplace models and find that the trade-in model may be more profitable despite the lower reverse logistics cost in the P2P model, and the P2P resale marketplace may be more profitable despite the trade-in program having direct control over the supply and demand of used products. Furthermore, both models can be better for the environment depending on the product characteristics and perceived quality difference between the used products sold in these programs. We further identify when each model is better for profitability and environment concurrently and when there is misalignment. Other results and managerial insights include comparative pricing of new and used products, market coverage, total sales, and resales, and the impact of product durability on pricing.

Growing evidence suggests that people are less likely to believe statements made by women rather than men. We consider whether assertive cheap talk, an important and widely used tool for increasing credibility, is a mechanism for this gender gap. If women face negative returns to assertive cheap talk, then they have less access to an effective tool for increasing their credibility. We provide evidence using a laboratory experiment and an online replication, both with real stakes, in an advice-following setting. We study whether assertive cheap talk affects advice following, whether subjects discriminate based on advisor gender, and whether there are differential returns to assertive cheap talk by gender. Subjects were randomly assigned to an unseen male or female team leader who were otherwise identical and to different types of prescripted, increasingly assertive written communication from the leader. Assertive language significantly increased advice following, but we find no evidence for gender discrimination. We also find that assertive language had positive returns for both male and female leaders, despite subjects perceiving this language as more masculine. However, female subjects were still less likely to choose the self-promotional language. Thus, even in the absence of discrimination, this choice would reduce adherence to advice provided by women, generating a gender gap. Greater use of assertive language could be an effective strategy for women to increase their influence and credibility in the labor market. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This study looks at the potential impact of autonomous road haulage on logistics operations and barriers for commercial implementation in the UK. The research focuses on large goods vehicles, capable of automated driving, where the driver is not required for some or all of the journey, for logistics operations between suppliers, manufacturing plant, and retailer. The data is collected through semi-structured interviews and scoring questionnaires. All 76 participants had experience working in the logistics industry, from various parts of the operations process. The data was analysed using thematic analysis followed with the results subsequently ranked by participants to identify the importance and perceived impact. Results revealed a near-term barrier for adoption of autonomous technology, is the lack of standardisation, as technology is progressing in many different directions, with little consultation on what features are needed or how they will be implemented. The findings show the main impact of commercialisation of autonomous road haulage are overall maintenance cost reduction, due to less wear and tear, and operational cost reduction, especially for long-haul journeys, as vehicles can operate for longer hours. Moreover, despite barriers in the short term, such as public acceptance and transition costs, these will likely be outweighed by improvements in efficiency and utilisation. Based on findings from the study, we present six key considerations for the introduction of commercial autonomous road haulage, which can be used as a guide for policy makers, insurance companies, transport planning authorities, and vehicle manufacturers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous road haulage; Autonomous trucks; Freight operations; Transport policy","Automobile manufacture; Autonomous vehicles; Commercial vehicles; Cost reduction; Industrial research; Insurance; Roads and streets; Surveys; Autonomous road haulage; Autonomous truck; Commercial use; Costs reduction; Freight operation; Goods vehicles; Logistic operations; Policy makers; Potential impacts; Transport policy; Decision making; commercialization; freight transport; road transport; technology adoption; transportation planning; transportation policy; trucking; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114183955

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop and implement an integrated knowledge-based system (KBS) and evaluate the overall DSC readiness value (score) of an organization. DSC readiness factors are identified from an extensive literature review and validated by experts from academia and industry. The proposed KBS is based on Fuzzy-AHP​ that establishes a link between DSC readiness factors and their impact on performance and evaluates overall DSC readiness value (score). The proposed KBS has been validated in an Indian manufacturing company, and results show that the overall DSC readiness value (score) of the case company is 0.267.

As a result, it is critical to quantify a household's carbon footprint in order to reduce it over time. One of the best ways to measure carbon emitted from various sectors of the economy, including household daily activities, is to calculate a country's carbon footprint (CF). This study statistically examined the magnitude of households' carbon footprints and their relationships with household daily activities and certain socio-economic demographic variables in Malaysia. Results revealed that the average household carbon footprint amounted to 11.76 t-CO2. The average also showed that the primary carbon footprint, 7.02 t-CO2 or 59.69% was higher compared to the secondary carbon footprint which was 4.73 t- CO2 or 40.22% and assessment revealed significant differences among household types. The largest carbon footprint was evident in a medium-high cost urban area, estimated at 20.14 t-CO2, while the carbon footprint found in a rural area was 9.58 t-CO2. In the latter, the primary carbon footprint was almost double the figure of 5.84 t-CO2 (61%) than the secondary carbon footprint of 3.73 t-CO2 (39%). The study reveals a higher carbon footprint in urban areas compared to rural ones depicting the effects of urbanisation and urban sprawl on household lifestyles and carbon footprints. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study will help policymakers design and implement stronger policies that enforce low-carbon activities and energy-saving goods and services in order to reduce urban Malaysia's carbon footprint dramatically. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Energy; Households; Lifestyle","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Rural areas; Carbon emissions; Daily activity; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Household; Lifestyle; Malaysia; Policy implications; Primary carbon; Urban areas; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110139073

To this end, retailers need to understand customers' preferences for different products. Academic/practical relevance: This is particularly challenging when only sales and product-availability data are recorded, and not all products are displayed in all periods. Similarly, in revenue management contexts, firms (airlines, hotels, etc.) need to understand customers' preferences for different options in order to optimize the menu of products to offer. Methodology: In this paper, we study the estimation of preferences under a multinomial logit model of demand when customers arrive over time in accordance with a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. This model has recently caught important attention in both academic and industrial practices. We formulate the problem as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem, which turns out to be nonconvex. Results: Our contribution is twofold: From a theoretical perspective, we characterize conditions under which the maximum-likelihood estimates are unique and the model is identifiable. From a practical perspective, we propose a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm to ease the optimization of the likelihood function. Through an extensive numerical study, we show that our algorithm leads to better estimates in a noticeably short computational time compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Managerial implications: The theoretical results provide a solid foundation for the use of the model in terms of the quality of the derived estimates. At the same time, the fast MM algorithm allows the implementation of the model and the estimation procedure at large scale, compatible with real industrial applications.

Academic/practical relevance: Previous research has found price discrimination in business-to-consumer markets, in which buyers are end customers. There is limited research on suppliers' price-quoting behaviors and price discrimination in business-to-business (B2B) markets. It is unclear whether certain characteristics of B2B buyers, who are often representatives of firms and not end customers, would influence suppliers' pricing decisions. Methodology: We collaborate with a global trading company that runs a field experiment on a B2B platform. Results: We find that there is no significant difference in the wholesale prices quoted to buyers selling in U.S. and South African markets. We also find that suppliers quote significantly higher wholesale prices to white buyers than to Asian and black buyers regardless of country. However, price discrimination disappears when buyers present market information to suppliers, providing the lowest wholesale price offered by other suppliers in the market, whereas price discrimination remains when buyers present social information to suppliers, thereby indicating the buyer is referred by a previous customer. In addition, we show that market information can help buyers obtain a lower wholesale price because it signals a lower willingness to pay. Social information, however, can reduce price quotes for only black and white buyers but not for Asian (particularly Chinese) buyers.

Technological progress and innovation are important drivers of economic growth. Using cross-country panel data on patenting at the industry-level, we connect these facts and show that financial crises have large and long-lasting impacts on innovation (measured by patenting) for sectors dependent on external finance. This effect is driven by banking crises, which have both immediate and long lasting impacts — upwards of 8 years. This is consistent with firms both losing funding for new projects (reducing patents in the long-term) and needing to liquidate existing projects to meet immediate financing pressures (reducing patents in the near-term). This compares to stock market crashes, which see an immediate decline followed by a compensating increase, consistent with projects being “shelved” and redeployed later. Banking crises are thus unique in their impact on innovation, providing a link between them and the observed patterns of persistently lower long-term growth. The effects are larger if the banking crisis was preceded by weak or leveraged banks. We do not observe a decline in patent quality during banking crises. This financial channel of innovation is not operative for currency crises, but we do find evidence for a trade channel, whereby higher exporting industries increase their patenting following the accompanying terms of trade improvement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Banking crises; Financial crises; Growth; Innovation; Patents","banking; economic growth; export; financial crisis; innovation; stock market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112783161

This mode of interaction allows the grocer to collect advance demand information, which has been shown to reduce inventory costs in non-perishables. For perishable items where spoilage is a major cost driver, the effects of advance ordering on a grocer's daily operation is not yet clear. To investigate this, we develop an MDP-based model that reflects a modern grocer's inventory decision system. Key model characteristics are stochastic demand and random product shelf lives. The model solves for the optimal replenishment policy, and facilitates quantifying how next-day or two-day orders influence profitability. A numerical study is presented for various short-life products, and the results indicate that two-day orders can increase profit, reduce inventory and spoilage, while maintaining the overall availability level. These benefits increase as the replenishment product's shelf life decreases. We show that the average cart value, proportion of short life items, handling time, and order pick rate are strong determinants of the extent that two-day orders can offset omnichannel fulfillment cost. In some cases, there exists an attainable breakeven pick rate, such that the grocer's expected profit is higher with curbside advance orders than with traditional in-store purchases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Curbside pickup; Demand lead time; Online grocery; Ordering policy; Perishables","Pickups; Spoilage; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Advance demand information; Curbside pickup; Demand lead time; Inventory costs; Online grocery; Order policies; Perishable; Perishable items; Pick rate; Product shelf life; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107754613

I introduce two imperfect firm-performance measures, cash flows and accounting earnings, into a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms under imperfect information. The model demonstrates that improvements in measurement systems lead to more informed decisions on the part of firms and ultimately to allocation of greater resources to high-productivity firms via the product and input markets. Estimated parameter values are consistent with accrual accounting improving managers' information about current productivity by providing a better measure of historical firm performance. Quantitative analysis suggests that introducing accrual-accounting information on top of cash-accounting information leads to a 0.5% increase in aggregate U.S. productivity and a 0.7% increase in aggregate U.S. output via improved resource allocation. The corresponding estimates for China and India, as benchmarks for developing countries, are larger: a 1.5% to 2.3% increase in aggregate productivity and a 2.3% to 3.4% increase in aggregate output.

Uniform sampling has been widely used for simple geometry measurement, e.g. planes and spheres. However, there is a lack of appropriate sampling techniques that can be applied to complex freeform surfaces, especially those with sparse topographical features, e.g. cutting edges and other high-curvature features. In this paper, a distortion-free intelligent sampling and reconstruction method with improved efficiency for sparse surfaces is proposed. In this method, a locally-refined T-spline approximation is firstly applied which maps a surface to a simplified T-spline space; then a shift-invariant space sampling method and corresponding reconstruction are applied for the surface measurement. This sampling strategy provides a cost-effective sampling design and guarantees the surface reconstruction without information loss in a T-spline space. Theoretical demonstrations and case studies show that this sampling strategy can provide up to an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy or efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, for the measurement of sparse surfaces, from macro- to nano-scales. © 2020, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","High-accuracy; Intelligent sampling; Surface metamodelling; Surface reconstruction; T-splines","Cost effectiveness; Interpolation; Surface measurement; Curvature features; Different geometry; Intelligent samplings; Sampling strategies; Sampling technique; Shift-invariant space; State-of-the-art methods; Topographical features; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088646844

Universidad Externado de Colombia, Colombia","The rich and complex outcomes of foresight activities are often difficult to translate into policy relevant intelligence. The struggle in connecting futures intelligence to policy making can be read as a basic challenge in foresight: working on futures intelligence has emerged as a way to improve policy, but once it is delegated to professional foresight practitioners with attendant quality and quality control, however, it also introduces a distance to policy making. Whilst independence and methodological rigour is desirable for high quality futures intelligence, bridging this intelligence with the policy context is essential for its use. Experiencing this challenge during a scenario exercise on the future European research and innovation system, the authors of this paper embarked on an experiment to go beyond evaluating the robustness of the scenarios, produced in a foresight exercise, by developing and applying “policy lenses” to translate the scenarios into policy tailored intelligence. This paper describes the experiment, which saw the development and application of three types of policy lenses: (1) a lens based on the layered processes of European policy making, (2) a lens based on three research and innovation policy priorities and (3) a lens on alternative geo-political situations of the European continent. The paper describes the logic behind the lenses, the interpretation of the original scenarios when viewed through these lenses, and then concludes by reflecting on how such an experiment could be generalised to other settings of policy-oriented foresight. © 2021","Europeanisation; Innovation systems; Mission-oriented policy; Policy-lensing; Research systems; Scenarios","Technological forecasting; Decisions makings; Europeanization; High quality; Innovation system; Mission-oriented policy; Policy making; Policy-lensing; Research system; Scenario; Strategic intelligence; Decision making; decision making; future prospect; innovation; research method; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108333248

Drawing on behavioural reasoning theory and its implication in explaining user behaviour, this study aims to shed light on hospital practitioners’ reasons for and against resistance to IoMT. We proposed an integrative theoretical framework that combines system, information, and individual positive and negative factors to understand and explain clinical users’ scepticism and resistance toward IoMT.

Our study contributes to the literature by proposing new insights into IoMT users’ decision-making, considering a dual approach that simultaneously explains positive and negative pathways toward scepticism and resistance.

We started by exploring the SODA history followed by the evaluation of published articles associated with the practical applications of SODA from 1989 (publication date of Rational Analysis for a Problematic World) to 2018. We searched relevant databases and studied 200 SODA-related articles, we examined the scope of each application, whether as a sole SODA application or as a combination with other methodologies. We also investigated which elements of the methodology have been used. Our findings suggest that SODA through its associated technique of cognitive mapping has been used in conjunction with other methods. SODA is a participative methodology designed to provide dialogue, reflection, learning, consensus and commitment, but the sample of articles surveyed indicate that its use has been limited to helping modelling the problematic situation and providing a common understanding to participants. Other core activities, such as group negotiation support, have not been fully used. Our findings suggest that SODA is a methodology suitable to different contexts and its practice has grown steadily over time but that to exploit the full use of its activities, its creators need to produce a set of constitutive rules to guide the applications. © 2021 The Authors","Cognitive mapping; Constitutive rules; Problem structuring; SODA; Survey","Mathematical models; Operations research; Cognitive mapping; Core activity; Negotiation support; Operational research; Problem structuring methods; Rational analysis; Strategic options; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097464360

Forecasters typically select the most appropriate statistical model for each time series. However, statistical models usually presume some data generation process while making strong assumptions about the errors. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric approach — ‘forecasting with cross-similarity’, which tackles model uncertainty in a model-free manner. Existing similarity-based methods focus on identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e., ‘self-similarity’. In contrast, we propose searching for similar patterns from a reference set, i.e., ‘cross-similarity’. Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths. We evaluate the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it yields competitive accuracy in both points forecasts and prediction intervals. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Dynamic time warping; Empirical evaluation; Forecasting; M competitions; Time series similarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093975748

Geneva, Switzerland, may be soon joining them. This paper builds on a detailed review of the existing schemes to identify a set of plausible design options for the Geneva congestion charge. In turn, it analyzes their acceptability, leveraging a large survey of residents of both Geneva and the surrounding areas of Switzerland and France. Our original approach combines a discrete choice experiment with randomized informational treatments. We consider an extensive set of attributes, such as perimeter, price and price modulation, use of revenues, and exemption levels and beneficiaries. The informational treatments address potential biased beliefs concerning the charge’s expected effects on congestion and pollution. We find that public support depends crucially on the policy design. We identify an important demand for exemptions, which, albeit frequently used in the design of environmental taxation, is underexplored in the analysis of public support. This demand for exemptions is not motivated by efficiency reasons. It comes mostly by local residents, for local residents. Further, people show a marked preference for constant prices, even if efficiency would point to dynamic pricing based on external costs. Hence, we highlight a clear trade-off between efficiency and acceptability. However, we also show, causally, that this gap can in part be closed, with information provision. Analyzing heterogeneity, we show that preferences vary substantially with where people live and how they commute. Even so, we identify several designs that reach majority support. © 2021, The Author(s).","Acceptability; Congestion charge; Policy design; Public support; Road pricing","Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Economics; Efficiency; Taxation; Traffic congestion; Transportation charges; Congestion charges; Discrete choice experiments; Dynamic pricing; Environmental taxation; Expected effects; External costs; Information provision; Local residents; Costs; demand analysis; design; policy making; price dynamics; questionnaire survey; road; traffic congestion; France; Geneva [Switzerland]; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107266949

The literature has reached a consensus that investments in technology only may not reap benefits from business analytics (BA). As such, the main purpose of BA is not about how to install technical capabilities, but about how to create a process whereby a firm builds a value chain converting data into insights and ultimately into quality outcomes. Drawing upon the theory of the information value chain, this study develops a BA value chain creation model and tests it with 268 firms. Results show that organizational resilience, absorptive capacity, and analytical IT capabilities are critical antecedents of analytical decision-making quality, which in turn influences BA net benefits. In particular, organizational resilience emerges as a more significant determinant of analytical decision-making quality than technology and people in the BA value chain creation.

Consequently, firms need to deal with high degrees of uncertainty, complexity, equivocality and ambiguity in the front-end. These four knowledge problems constitute important challenges to managers and engineers when a new process definition is created. Prior research into the front end of process innovation is limited, and for radical projects close to non-existent. We analyse six radical process innovation projects situated in the food processing industry in the United Kingdom and provide three key contributions. First, we uncover the underlying sources of knowledge problems, and the specific coping mechanisms used to address them. Second, we offer a framework that delineates the relationships between the sources of knowledge problems, the knowledge problems per se, and the coping mechanisms which enable more effective decision-making regarding the creation of process concepts and definitions. Finally, we extend prior studies of the front end by revealing the challenges faced with respect to ambiguity, thus providing a more granular understanding of fuzziness.

Drawing insight from organisational theory literature, we develop a multi-theory model, combining the elements of the theory of planned behaviour, competing value framework, and technology - organisational and environmental theory to examine how the organisational mechanisms interact with espoused cultural values and employee cognitive belief to influence cybersecurity control procedures. Using a structured questionnaire, we deployed structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the survey data obtained from public sector information technology organisations in Nigeria to test the hypothesis on the relationship of socio-organisational mechanisms and techno-cultural factors with other key determinants of employee security behaviour. The results showed that knowledge of cybersecurity and employee cognitive belief significantly influence the employees' intentions to comply with organisational cybersecurity control mechanisms. The research further noted that the influence of organisational elements such as leadership on employee security behaviour is mediated by espoused cultural values while the impact of employee cognitive belief is moderated by security technologies. For effective cybersecurity compliance, leaders and policymakers are therefore to promote organisational security initiatives that ensure incorporation of cybersecurity principles and practices into job descriptions, routines, and processes.

We find that direct and spillover effects exist. These refer to the effects of customers' closed-form evaluations of a product or service attribute on their reviews of the same attribute and other attributes in their open-ended comments, respectively. Regarding the direct effect, positive closed-form evaluations of attributes reduce customers' behaviors of writing details about the same attributes in open-ended comments, but negative closed-form evaluations of attributes increase that behavior. The increasing effect is greater than the reducing effect. Regarding the spillover effect, closed-form evaluations of certain attributes increase customers' behaviors of writing details about other attributes in open-ended comments. Additionally, we find that the heterogeneity effect lies in the different roles of closed-form evaluations and open-ended textual comments in reflecting customers' overall satisfaction. Open-ended comments about the advantages of the attributes have a more significant effect than the closed-form evaluations of the same attributes in reflecting overall customer satisfaction, but closed-form evaluations better reflect customers' low overall satisfaction with the disadvantages of the attributes.

The number of performance factors (inputs and outputs) plays a crucial role when applying DEA to real-world applications. In other words, if the number of performance factors is significantly greater than the number of DMUs, it is highly possible to arrive at a large portion of efficient DMUs, which practically may become problematic due to the lack of ample discrimination among DMUs. The current research aims to develop an array of selecting DEA models to narrow down the performance factors based upon a rule of thumb.

This criterion captures the trade-off between the firm-centric objective of maximizing the expected revenue and the customercentric objective of maximizing the expected utility. The customers choose according to the multinomial logit model, and there is a constraint on the offered assortments characterized by a totally unimodular matrix. We show that we can solve the revenue-utility assortment optimization problem by finding the assortment that maximizes only the expected revenue after adjusting the revenue of each product by the same constant. Finding the appropriate revenue adjustment requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem. We give a parametric linear program to generate a collection of candidate assortments that is guaranteed to include an optimal solution to the revenue-utility assortment optimization problem. This collection of candidate assortments also allows us to construct an efficient frontier that shows the optimal expected revenue-utility pairs as we vary the weights in the objective function. Moreover, we develop an approximation scheme that limits the number of candidate assortments while ensuring a prespecified solution quality. Finally, we discuss practical assortment optimization problems that involve totally unimodular constraints. In our computational experiments, we demonstrate that we can obtain significant improvements in the expected utility without incurring a significant loss in the expected revenue. © 2020 INFORMS.","Choice modeling; Multinomial logit; Revenue-utility trade-off; Totally unimodular constraints","Economic and social effects; Linear programming; Approximation scheme; Assortment optimization; Computational experiment; Linear combinations; Multinomial logit model; Nonconvex optimization problem; Objective functions; Totally unimodular; Logistic regression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106549978

However, estimating how each alliance member's centrality affects alliance performance is challenging because the end market might value each partner's contribution differently. We solve this empirical question with a two-sided matching model that accounts for the partners' endogenous selection and estimates the effect of each side's centrality and input quality on performance. We implement the method in the novel context of the Thoroughbred horse industry, in foal-sharing alliances between buyers and suppliers. We find that buyer centrality has a larger marginal effect on the alliance performance than the supplier centrality because buyers, who on average are less central in our context, are more likely to diffuse valuable information to the end market. Managerial Summary: Alliance partners often struggle with identifying what their contributions and their partner's contribution are to the alliance performance. We use a new method to identify each side's contribution to their alliance. Our findings offer a few recommendations to firms forming similar alliances. First, we find that the less central partner in the business network has greater impact on the alliance performance due to their ability to diffuse more valuable information to the market. Second, our results suggest that product input quality that is relatively unknown impacts alliance performance more than low and average quality. Alliance partners may benefit more from experimenting with unknown inputs. Third, more central actors may reduce spending on mass communications if valuable information comes to the market through their less central partners. © 2021 The Authors.

The proposed architecture integrates methods from sequence learning, model predictive control, and game theory. Computers in this architecture learn objectives and strategies from experimental data to support humans with strategic decisions while operational decisions are made by humans. The paper also presents data-driven methods for partitioning tasks among a team of computers in this architecture. The generalized methodology is illustrated on the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. The results from this application show that low-performing players can benefit from the game-theoretic decision support whereas this support can be overly conservative for high-performing players. The proposed approach provides safe though suboptimal suggestions particularly against an opponent with an unknown level of expertise. The results further show that problem solution with a team of computers based on non-intuitive task partitioning significantly improves the quality of decisions compared to an all-in-one solution with a single computer. © 2021 The Authors","Complex systems; Differential games; Feedback control; Strategic decisions; Task partitioning DECSUP-D-20-00719R1","Decision support systems; Game theory; Memory architecture; Model predictive control; Problem solving; Complex problem solving; Data-driven methods; Dynamic environments; Human-computer collaboration; Operational decisions; Proposed architectures; Real-time strategy games; Strategic decision making; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099805341

Greenland is economically dependent on deep-sea fisheries, including for Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). The offshore halibut fishery, which employs demersal trawls (800–1,400 m), obtained MSC certification in 2017. This provides an opportunity to critically assess the governance of deep-sea resources, with reference to the MSC certification. The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) framework, originally designed to analyse MPAs and adapted for this study, finds an effective system of state-led governance, supported by scientific, certification and industry actors. Arising from its socio-economic importance, the industry's considerable influence is used to align management with the MSC certification. Outcomes directly attributable to engagement with the MSC certification include the introduction of a management plan and new benthic research programmes. However, questions are raised about the certification, providing case study examples of existing criticisms. Assessments are weak with respect to benthic habitats and over-reliant on the definitive, expert judgement of Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs), whose independence is questioned. Separate MSC assessments of Greenlandic and German vessels in the fleet provided an opportunity to consider the consistency and robustness of the process, which raised serious concerns. Two different CABs found the benthic impact of vessels using the same gear in the same area to be sustainable, by employing fundamentally different and conflicting logic. This represents a serious failing of certification process, undermining the assurance it is intended to provide. © 2020 The Authors","Deep-sea; Eco-label; Management; Sustainable","certification; deep-sea fishery; demersal fish; demersal fishery; ecolabeling; fishery economics; fishery management; flatfish; governance approach; sustainability; sustainable development; trawling; Arctic; Greenland; Reinhardtius hippoglossoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087368709

Understanding Indian consumers’ valuation of fuel economy while purchasing a two-wheeler is crucial to evaluate whether Indian two-wheeler buyers are myopic with regards to future fuel costs. However currently, there exists no quantification of the value that Indian two-wheeler buyers ascribe to fuel economy. We address this gap in the literature by analyzing revealed preference survey data from more than 8000 respondents across India, who purchased a new two-wheeler in 2018. Discrete choice models, including standard conditional logit and flexible mixed logit, are used to infer estimates of the discount rate that Indian consumers apply to obtain the present value of future operating cost at the time of two-wheeler purchase. The results of conditional logit indicate that the annual discount rate is below 10% for Indian two-wheeler buyers with monthly household incomes above 15,000 rupees (∼US$215 in 2018; ∼73% of the sample). Mixed logit suggests substantial heterogeneity in discount rates across respondents at a given income level. The median of the mixing distribution is close to the conditional logit estimates, which leads to a conclusion that an average Indian two-wheeler buyer ascribes a high value to future fuel cost savings. Besides, our analysis provides various insights into Indian consumers’ preferences. For instance, style/looks, fuel economy, comfort, and brand (in decreasing order) are the top four factors that influence two-wheeler purchase decisions of Indian consumers. © 2021 The Authors","Discount rate; Discrete choice; Energy paradox; Revealed preference data; Two-wheelers","Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Fuels; Sales; Surveys; Conditional logit; Congested traffic; Discrete choice models; Exponential growth; Household income; Mixing distributions; Purchase decision; Revealed preference; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101143903

In particular, there are conditions under which the optimal equilibrium strategy for the platforms is to allow the use of ad blockers (rather than using an ad-block wall or charging a fee for viewing ad-free content). The key insight is that allowing ad blockers serves to differentiate platform users based on their disutility to viewing ads. This allows platforms to increase their ad intensity on those that do not use the ad blockers and achieve higher returns than in a world without ad blockers. We show robustness of these results when we allow a larger combination of platform strategies, as well as by explaining how ad white-listing schemes offered by modern ad blockers can add value.

To empirically estimate the impact of humanity onto climate and vice versa, climate econometrics has emerged as a field split into two strands: one side focusing on conditional models of the economic impact of climate change, taking climate as given. The other side empirically models climate, taking economic and human activity as given. However, economic and environmental systems are determined with feedback in both directions. Here I examine one way to reconcile the two strands of climate-econometric research by considering a full (albeit simple) empirical climate-economic system and the conditions under which the system can be studied by only looking at the conditional economic or climate side alone. Weak exogeneity is necessary for valid conditioning, strong exogeneity – required for conditional forecasting – lends itself to the concept of climate-takers and climate-setters (countries measurably affecting local climate), while super-exogeneity can be interpreted as policy invariance for the economic impact side, and as a ‘no-tipping point’ condition on the physical side. An application to a stylised climate-economic system using temperatures, SO2 emissions, and global forcing highlights how these concepts can be applied in practice. A system analysis in climate econometrics allows us to move towards fully-coupled empirical climate-economic models accounting for the necessary feedback to obtain empirical estimates of the impact of climate on humanity and vice versa. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate econometrics; Exogeneity; VAR","Climate models; Earth (planet); Economic and social effects; Economics; Statistics; Sulfur dioxide; Conditional models; Earth's climate; Economic impacts; Economic models; Economic system; Empirical estimate; Environmental systems; Human activities; Climate change; climate change; econometrics; economic impact; environmental economics; human activity; nature-society relations; vector autoregression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100605987

An open question is why women are more likely than men to switch towards majors that lead to lower-paying careers. Drawing on research suggesting that women are affected more by negative feedback than men, we use unique administrative data from a large private university on the East Coast from 2008 to 2016 to test whether women are more likely than men to switch majors in response to low grades in major-related classes. We also test whether the prevalence of men in a major or a major's reputation for being stereotypically male-oriented induces women to switch out of that major more readily than men. We control for other factors that may affect a student's final major, including high school performance, gender composition of faculty and peers, and economic returns of majors. The results show that overall women and men are equally likely to change their majors in response to poor grades in major-related courses. We also find no evidence that women in male-dominated majors are more likely than men to switch out, but we find that men with very low grades in female-dominated majors are more likely to switch out of these majors than women. In addition, we find that women are more likely to switch out of majors that are both male-dominated and STEM in response to poor performance compared to men. Thus, our results suggest that only when women students experience multiple signals suggesting their lack of fit in a field (i.e., low grades combined with gender peer composition, and external stereotyping signals) they tend to switch out of the major more often than male students. We find that men exhibit this tendency in response to even fewer overlapping signals about misfit than women. © 2021 The Authors","Education gender gap; Major choice; STEM field","gender discrimination; gender issue; numerical model; wage gap; womens employment; womens status; workplace; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100382564

We study epidemics of late blight in potato as a collective action challenge in Oromia, Ethiopia. As a highly infectious, air-borne disease, potato late blight represents a public bad: it is non-excludable and non-rival. Managing public bads is a major policy challenge in Ethiopia due to structural inefficiencies and resource constraints to formal interventions. Dispersed rural farmers lack capacity and infrastructure to maintain communication flows that are key for effective collective action. We introduce an experimental, framed, public bads game where randomly selected groups of potato farmers are presented with a collective action dilemma whether to invest in a joint initiative to control late blight (fungicide spraying) or to suffer productivity loss if the threshold is missed. We also manipulate the ICT-mediated communication variable by providing access to a smartphone-based group communicator to a random sub-sample of the participants. We find that collective action problems do occur and participants tend to free-ride on the efforts of others. We show that ICT-mediated communication has a statistically significant positive effect on cooperative behavior, disease control, returns on investment and game winnings. Our qualitative analysis of the voice chats provides evidence that farmers use ICT to: (1) facilitate complex coordination, (2) establish collective norms, (3) detect and pressure 'free riders', and (4) manage reputation to increase trust. This paper complements the existing literature on public bads by studying real-life stakeholders in a real-life collective action challenge. It contributes to the literature on the contested topic of 'ICTrevolution' and its supposed transforming effect on African agriculture. From the point of view of policy, we draw attention to the pivotal importance of improving communication infrastructure in rural regions of Ethiopia, and the opportunities to scale collective action interventions through ICT. © 2020 The Authors","Collective action; Ethiopia; ICT4D; Lab-in-the-field experiment; Plant epidemics; Public bads","collective action; epidemic; experimental study; fungicide; information and communication technology; mobile phone; potato; productivity; Ethiopia; Oromia; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099530447

We argue that a positive product status accrued in a leading foreign country, or outside status, increases domestic market performance by providing home country audiences with a means of self-enhancement. We predict that the impact of outside status will be stronger when the foreign and home countries have similar economic conditions, and when the products are high priced, luxury goods—as social approval and prestige-seeking are important factors in purchase decisions for these products. We test our hypotheses using a sample of firms and vehicles in the automotive industry. Results from two-stage multi-level analysis support our arguments. Our results have several implications for research related to status transfer and international business. Managerial summary: We look at how consumers in the home country of an automaker (Germany, Japan, and Korea) increase purchases of a car model that wins the J.D. Power APEAL award in the United States. Rather than telling those consumers anything new about the car's quality, the award bestows status on the vehicle from the leading outside market. (We call that reverse status transfer, as it flips the idea that domestic status helps firms competing in foreign markets.) Domestic consumers can share in some of that status by purchasing the vehicle, and they are especially likely to do so when it is a high priced or luxury model, as those aspects amplify the status effects, as does economic similarity between the United States and the home country. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","automotive industry; basking in reflected glory; international business; social identity theory; status transfer","Model automobiles; Purchasing; Sales; Domestic markets; Economic condition; Foreign countries; Foreign markets; International business; Multi-level analysis; Purchase decision; Self enhancements; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091388558

This paper relaxes this restriction and allows for one or more units to have pervasive effects in the network. The linear–quadratic central limit theorem of Kelejian and Prucha (2001) is generalized to allow for such dominant units, and the asymptotic properties of the GMM estimators are established in this more general setting. A new bias-corrected method of moments (BMM) estimator is also proposed that avoids the problem of weak instruments by self-instrumenting the spatially lagged dependent variable. Both cases of homoskedastic and heteroskedastic errors are considered and the associated estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, depending on the rate at which the maximum column sum of the weights matrix rises with n. The small sample properties of GMM and BMM estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and shown to be satisfactory. An empirical application to sectoral price changes in the US over the pre- and post-2008 financial crisis is also provided.

We argue that a core role of communication is to transmit information that helps co-workers do their job better. We build a simple model in which workers choose the amount of communication by trading off this benefit against the time cost incurred by the sender, and use it to derive a set of empirical predictions. We then exploit a natural experiment in an organization where problems arrive and must be sequentially dealt with by two workers. For exogenous reasons, the first worker can sometimes communicate face-to-face with their colleague. Consistently with the predictions of our model, we find that: (1) the second worker works faster (at the cost of the first worker having less time to deal with incoming problems) when face-to-face communication is possible, (2) this effect is stronger when the second worker is busier and for homogenous and closely located teams, and (3) the (career) incentives of workers determine how much they communicate with their colleagues. We also find that workers partially internalise social outcomes in their communication decisions. Our findings illustrate how workers in teams adjust the amount of mutual communication to its costs and benefits. © 2020 The Author(s).

How do operational levers under a manufacturer s control affect return rates? Academic/practical relevance: Consumer returns raise major questions for manufacturers and retailers because losses related to returns are substantial. However, levers commonly used to discourage returns, such as strict return policies, can dampen sales, which is a significant drawback. The literature on consumer returns has focused on retailer and purchase attributes but has ignored whether manufacturers can take a proactive role to influence returns. Manufacturers and retailers have an interest in understanding how operational levers influence return rates. Methodology: This work attempts to answer questions about the influence of manufacturing on return rates by using detailed operational data from a leading U.S. manufacturer of automotive accessories. We study the impact of key operational levers on return rates by using a logistic regression model, while controlling for retailer return policies and numerous product, purchase, and consumer attributes. Results: We find that increased task-level worker specialization has a significant and U-shaped impact on return rates. Increased workload levels in production leads to a significant increase in return rates, whereas product personalization leads to lower return rates. Managerial implications:We provide an empirical estimate of the effect of operational variables on return rates that are useful in evaluating managerial trade-offs. Our findings suggest that allowing customers to personalize products can significantly reduce return rates. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

An observational analysis of customers queuing at a grocery store, and four online studies in which participants waited in virtual queues, revealed that waiting in last place diminishes wait satisfaction while increasing the probabilities of switching and abandoning queues, with detrimental implications for queuing systems. The research suggests that last-place aversion can lead to maladaptive customer behaviors—switching behaviors that increase wait times and abandoning when the benefits of waiting are most pronounced. The results indicate that this behavior is partially explained by the inability to make a downward social comparison; namely, when no one is behind a queuing individual, that person is less certain that continuing to wait is worthwhile. Furthermore, this paper provides evidence that queue transparency is an effective service design lever that managers can use to reduce the deleterious effects of last-place aversion in queues. When people cannot see that they are in last place, the behavioral effects of last-place aversion are nullified; and when they can see that they are not in last place, the tendency to renege is greatly diminished. Finally, a system-level experiment, in which pairs of queues were created and analyzed, reveals that when the effects of last-place aversion are addressed, overall abandonment decreases, such that with equivalent arrival and service rates, total service provision can be increased.

Furthermore, the ability of vertically integrated platforms to imitate rivals does not necessarily harm consumers.

This is especially true with U.S. agricultural export commodities, such as corn and soybeans, that are characterized by small margins but large volume. Traditionally, market participants have relied on naïve methods for predicting barge rates, which represent the cost to transport the agriculture commodity along the Mississippi River system. A testable hypothesis is whether a spatial autoregressive model attempting to predict these barge rates will outperform a naïve model. Results support the hypothesis that improved one-, two-, and five-week-ahead forecasts can be generated using this spatial model. The benefits of increased accuracy in barge rate forecasts are quantified in a simple trading scenario. Market participants can save 17%–29% on barge rate transportation costs depending on the river segment.

In this process, the study attempts to uncover the relevant maintenance performance dimensions from the perspectives of the surveyed managers. In addition, the mediating effect of information availability on the main performance measures utilization is studied. Design/methodology/approach: The research at hand is survey-based. It utilizes the responses of a sample of ninety-five (95) experienced maintenance managers to identify the most relevant maintenance performance measures. Factor analysis is then utilized to uncover the important dimensions of performance, as seen by the respondents. Additionally, using the Partial Least Squares method, several models were studied. Findings: The findings of this exploratory research appear to suggest that maintenance managers are beginning to broaden their perspective with regard to performance management. While machine and plant-related performance measures are still emphasized, maintenance managers are slowly moving toward a wider organizational orientation. While the manufacturing organizations are becoming more and more customer-oriented open systems, the maintenance function of these organizations is still, for the most part, operating under the semi-open system orientation. Overall, it appears that an emerging maintenance strategy is slowly taking shape. Research limitations/implications: For the most part, performance measures and measurement related to maintenance have not received enough attention from researchers. Therefore, the literature dealing with the different facets of performance in maintenance has not been forthcoming. The study attempts to fill this apparent gap in the literature. This is important, as maintenance managers are being asked to contribute to the achievement of the competitive strategies of their organizations. Therefore, they must quickly learn how to view maintenance from a coherent strategic organizational perspective. Such a perspective should help in integrating the maintenance, resources, capabilities, and technical know-how in order to serve the strategic goal of their organization. The research at hand is limited to a sample from Portugal. Therefore, the results and conclusions must be interpreted accordingly. Practical implications: As maintenance managers struggle to move from a machine-orientation to a more organizational-wide strategic orientation, they are often left with many questions and few answers. This study attempts to bring this problem to the spotlight so that it can receive more systematic empirical and practical research. In this context, the role of maintenance managers in the process of organizational strategy formulation should be examined.

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopt macroeconomic fundamentals and the log-returns of 45 listed firms in the Chinese 5G industry to construct the weighted adjacency matrix by measuring the correlation parameters and then use the triangulated maximally filtered graph (TMFG) algorithm to construct the dependence network. It analyses the topological structure of the constructed networks to obtain the dependence characteristics for each firm in the whole industrial supply chain at different levels. Findings: The empirical results provide a comprehensive and concise snapshot of the industrial structure, across the whole 5G industry at different levels, rather than just a “one-to-one” pattern. Specifically, the dependence characteristics of different firms are heterogeneous, and most firms are highly connected with partners in the whole industrial supply chain, whereas a few firms that are weakly connected. Those closely connected firms are usually in the midstream. In addition, compared with firms at different levels, downstream firms usually have closer dependencies and stronger influence capabilities. Practical implications: Regulators not only should promote stability development for those firms most intensely connected with whole industry chain but also protect those firms with weak link in the whole industry chain. Investors should better understand the embedded ties among different firms to obtain effective market information and can select multiple firms with fewer connections as backup to conduct joint investment for risk mitigation. Mangers should give priority to the central players/firms in the whole industrial supply chain and establish the alliances with closely connected firms. Originality/value: This study contributes to both the information system and operation management literature by constructing a new network method, Copula-TMFG, to capture the dependence structure among Chinese firms in 5G industry, empirically providing some strategic insights for 5G industry stakeholders, such as regulators, investors and managers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","5G industry; Copula–TMFG; Dependence structure; Operating characteristics","Commerce; Graph algorithms; Information management; Investments; Supply chains; Correlation parameters; Design/methodology/approach; Industrial structures; Industrial supply chains; Industry stakeholders; Macroeconomic fundamentals; Topological structure; Weighted adjacency matrixes; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099418918

The purpose of this paper is to calculate the workforce productivity changes of the US construction industry from 2006 to 2016, with the number of laborers as input and value of construction industry as output. Design/methodology/approach: The present study introduced the data envelopment analysis (DEA) based Malmquist productivity index model to measure the workforce productivity of the US construction industry from 2006 to 2016. Findings: The results indicated that the workforce productivity of the US construction industry experienced a continuous decline, except for the increases from 2011 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015. It was also shown that there were gaps in the workforce productivity development level among all states and nine regions in the US construction industry. Besides, the relationship between workforce productivity and four aspects, including real estate price, workforce, climate distribution and economic factors, was analyzed. Research limitations/implications: The calculation of the productivity of the US construction industry is based on the premise that the external environment is fixed and unchanged from 2006 to 2016, but the multi-level DEA model for further calculation is required for obtaining more effective conclusions. Social implications: This paper measures the workforce productivity of the US construction industry over the past 11 years, which added latest analysis and knowledge into the construction industry, providing decision-makers with advice and data support to formulate policies to improve workforce productivity.

We find that policies involving financial incentives or monetary awards have the potential of increasing the output and/or profits in some energy-related industries or sectors, but potentially at the cost of GDP in non-energy industries or sectors.

Our goal is to enhance the influence of the method by clarifying for consumers of modeling research how to understand and appreciate analytic modeling and use modeling results to enhance their own research. Our primary contribution is a guide for reading analytic models. Using comparisons with other methods and exemplar analytic models, we explore key features as well as counterintuitive aspects and common misconceptions. We also add by illuminating strengths and weaknesses of analytic modeling relative to other theory-building methods. Finally, we identify under-exploited opportunities for pairing analytic models with complementary methods.

Water diplomacy is an innovative approach and strategic tool to resolve water issues at local and trans-boundary scales when water conflicts rise in sharing water resources. Complex water supply and sharing issues arise from the existence of multiple stakeholders such as agriculture, industry, urban and domestic users, environmental use, and others competing for scarce water. Water diplomacy may contribute to solving a variety of water conflicts and in this sense is a tool for sustainable water resources management. This paper presents a review of water diplomacy focusing on various themes such as the vitality of water as a resource, virtual water, water conflicts, international water law, and management of trans-boundary waters that are reviewed in this paper in the context of searching for cogent water diplomacy strategies. This work’s findings show that conflicts about trans-boundary waters are more common in developing countries than in developed countries. The latter countries have developed trans-boundary agreements, which may serve as guidelines to developing countries in some cases. Virtual water may prevent future water conflicts by reducing water demand and water stresses and providing suitable conditions for negotiation between countries. Capacity building, training in cooperation, and negotiation are means of averting water conflicts. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","International water law; Management; Trans-boundary waters; Virtual water; Water conflicts","capacity building; developing world; guideline; international relations; stakeholder; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082727183

By adopting a supervisor-based perspective of I-deals and using the logic of appropriateness in decision-making as the theoretical framework, the study examines managers’ motives for authorizing I-deals. Specifically, we argue that supervisors are more likely to grant I-deals when they have received I-deals themselves in the past and that this relationship is moderated by supervisors’ exchange ideology. We also propose that supervisors will be less likely to authorize I-deals when they have low or high levels (compared to moderate levels) of justice sensitivity. Results from 182 supervisor-subordinate dyads from various organizations suggest a positive and linear relationship between supervisors’ I-deals and subordinates’ I-deals and a moderation effect of exchange ideology. Furthermore, results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between supervisors’ justice sensitivity and subordinates’ I-deals. This research expands our understanding of factors affecting supervisors’ decision making on I-deals authorization. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Decision making; Exchange ideology; Idiosyncratic deals; Justice sensitivity; Logic of appropriateness; Social exchange theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076861887

Unfortunately, a large investment gap prevails, particularly in developing economies with underdeveloped domestic capital markets and weak institutions. Multilateral development banks with softer budget constraints and longer investment horizons can play an important role in filling this gap. Development finance, which traditionally originated in the West, has been increasingly dominated by two Chinese state-owned development banks: the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank. These banks acted as major financiers of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative and, between 2005 and 2017, provided more than US$220 billion of overseas energy finance - more than any other multilateral development bank. Their investments have been controversial: the Chinese banks were often accused of financing fossil fuels projects located in politically and economically risky countries. This paper uses detailed data on the Chinese energy finance to illustrate the investment pattern of the Chinese banks, and implements Hurdle and simultaneous Probit models to test whether the two banks are in fact tolerant of the country risk: credit, governance and political risk. The analysis shows that projects located in countries that are politically stable but have higher credit risk and corruption levels are more likely to receive Chinese energy finance. Governance risk and autocratic regime type do not affect the decisions of the Chinese banks. This investment pattern indicates missed opportunities for advancing the clean energy transition and creates future risks for the host countries i.e. stranded assets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Energy finance; Energy policy","Budget control; Economics; Fossil fuels; Risk assessment; Budget constraint; Developing economies; Energy finances; Governance risks; Investment horizon; Political risks; Renewable energies; Simultaneous probit models; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097862550

In this paper, we demonstrate that conventional wisdom can be reversed when an incumbent OEM faces the possible entry of a competing OEM. We formulate the market competition over a two-period horizon. The incumbent OEM is the sole seller during the first period. End-of-use products could be remanufactured by the incumbent OEM (i.e., in-house remanufacturing), or by an independent remanufacturer (i.e., third-party remanufacturing). We find that in-house remanufacturing indeed increases the incumbent's profit because of the effect of market segmentation. Moreover, third-party remanufacturing can also be beneficial because of the effect of entry deterrence. If and only if the new production cost is sufficiently low, the effect of entry deterrence associated with third-party remanufacturing outperforms the effect of market segmentation associated with in-house remanufacturing from the incumbent's perspective. This paper provides a novel explanation for the prevalence of third-party remanufacturing: it may reduce incumbent OEMs’ profits, but it protects them from more significant losses caused by the entry of competing OEMs. Therefore, under certain conditions, incumbent OEMs should facilitate third-party remanufacturing even if it is detrimental. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Competition strategy; Game theory; In-house remanufacturing; Marketing-operations interface; Third-party remanufacturing","Commerce; Competition; Manufacture; Profitability; Entry deterrence; Game-theoretic model; Market competition; Market segmentation; New production; Original equipment manufacturers; Remanufacturer; Remanufacturers; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089806577

We focus on two forms of IT strategies: digitalization and embeddedness in IT outsourcing networks. Our longitudinal analysis of U.S. hospitals demonstrates that IT security investments reduce security breaches in less digitalized organizations but increase security breaches for highly digitalized organizations. Investing in technical network control security systems such as anti-virus and intrusion detection systems reduces external breaches. Implementing identity and access management security systems such as biometric scanning and user authentication decreases internal breaches but increases external breaches. However, organizations’ embeddedness in IT outsourcing networks weakens the impacts of these technologies investments on external breaches but amplifies the negative relationship between identity and access management security systems and internal breaches.

Existing studies investigated OUD treatment barriers via surveys as a means to mitigate this opioid crisis. However, the response rate of these surveys is low due to social stigma around opioids. We explore user-generated content in social media as a new data source to study OUD. We design a novel IT system, SImilarity Network-based DEep Learning (SINDEL), to discover OUD treatment barriers from patient narratives and address the challenge of morphs. SINDEL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NLP models, reaching an F1 score of 76.79 percent. Thirteen types of treatment barriers were identified and verified by domain experts. This work contributes to information systems with a novel deep-learning-based approach for text analytics and generalized design principles for social media analytics methods.

Academic/practical relevance: Information about future customer-service needs is becoming increasingly available through remote monitoring systems and data analytics. However, the literature has not systematically examined proactive service as a tool that can be used to better match demand to service supply when customers are strategic. Methodology: We combine (i) queueing theory, and in particular a diffusion approximation developed specifically for this problem that allows us to derive analytic approximations for customer waiting times, with (ii) game theory, which captures customer incentives to adopt proactive service. Results: We show that proactive service can reduce customer waiting times, even if only a relatively small proportion of customers agree to be flexible, the information lead time is limited, and the system makes occasional errors in providing proactive service—in fact, we show that the system’s ability to tolerate errors increases with (nominal) utilization. Nevertheless, we show that these benefits may fail to materialize in equilibrium because of economic frictions: Customers will underadopt proactive service (due to free-riding) and overjoin the system (due to negative congestion-based externalities). We also show that the service provider can incentivize optimal customer behavior through appropriate pricing. Managerial implications: Our results suggest that proactive service may offer substantial operational benefits, but caution that it may fail to fulfill its potential due to customer self-interested behavior.

Its findings allow for the distillation of the bases of swift trust into three coherent thematic blocks of different significance in the creation of swift trust. Bases related to team composition exert the strongest effects, whereas reputational and institutional information demonstrates much more limited effects, and action-related bases of swift trust are shown to be largely irrelevant.

Specifically, we investigate social learning in the context of interlocks between corporate boards, which allow firms to share knowledge and experiences with respect to their IT investments. Using a large data set of firm-years from 2001–2008, we find (a) a positive relationship exists between a focal firm’s IT investment and that of its interlocked firms; (b) this positive relationship is amplified by the interlocked firms’ IT capability but only if the focal firm has an active board, which devotes time to allow sufficient communication among directors; and (c) the component of the focal firm’s IT investment that is attributable to board interlock influence is positively related to the firm’s performance but only if the firm has an active board. Collectively, these findings support our central thesis: social learning through board interlocks can play a significant role in influencing a firm’s IT investments and enhancing their payoff. That said, attaining such benefits requires boards to incorporate those firms with high IT management capability and to strengthen board activity so interlocked members can substantively share their knowledge and experiences with IT investments.

We find that P3Fs lead to increased licensing within a year of the event. This result is significant, because one year is a short window given the usual timelines—licensing is a lengthy process that requires extensive planning and careful execution. Supported by a series of additional results, we interpret this finding as a reflection of rushed firm behavior. Correspondingly, our main finding is that drugs licensed in these circumstances (within a year of a P3F event) underperform in subsequent development: they are significantly less likely to reach the market compared with others licensed in normal conditions. Further analysis suggests that this underperformance may stem from the influence of rush on activities taking place in the “last mile” of the licensing process and could hinge on the quality of the agreements that firms converge to during contract negotiations.

However, women's access to economic resources does not always translate into improved bargaining power, and effects of economic strengthening interventions may vary across different decision-making domains. There is little robust evidence, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, showing the effect of improved access to economic resources on specific domains of decision-making within a family and very little is known about variation in this effect between monogamous and polygynous families. Furthermore, very few assessments explicitly examine specific pathways from participation in economic strengthening interventions to improved decision-making power in the household for women. Our study aims to address these gaps by examining—in the context of a randomized controlled trial administered in rural Burkina Faso—the effect of an economic strengthening intervention on specific domains of women's decision-making power and how it relates to monogamous/polygynous family structures and challenges to intra-household gender roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, we examine a specific pathway to better understand whether increased access to economic resources from this intervention translates into improved decision-making power for women. We use repeated-measures data collected from 360 adult female caregivers in the 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted among households living in abject poverty in Burkina Faso. We ran multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models to examine the effect of the intervention on different domains of women's involvement into household-level decision-making and variation of this effect by family structure (i.e. polygamous vs. monogamous families). We fit a structural equation model to examine whether access to assets mediates the effect of the intervention on different domains of women's involvement into household-level decision-making. We found that economic empowerment intervention increased women's involvement in making decisions about their children's well-being, but had no effect on women's say in making decisions about general household economy. We found most effects to be stronger in the treatment arm that received economic strengthening combined with family coaching offered to the whole household and directly targeting normative beliefs related to child wellbeing and gender norms. We also found no evidence that increased access to assets mediates the effect of intervention on improving women's decision-making power in different domains. Our findings suggest that to improve decision-making power for women in their household it is important to address structural gender inequalities and gender norms rooted in patriarchy, alongside the efforts to economically empower women. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Burkina Faso; Integrated economic empowerment intervention; Mediation model in a randomized controlled trial; Structural gender inequalities; The Graduation Program; Women's empowerment","accessibility; decision making; empowerment; female headed household; gender role; household structure; patriarchy; womens status; Burkina Faso; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090548287

We explore the dynamics of the order-up-to policy under lost-sales for the case of i.i.d. normally distributed demand and unit lead times. We consider the ideal minimum mean-squared error forecast and two alternative scenarios: partial demand observation and dynamic demand forecasting, providing a broad understanding of the operational performance of lost-sales systems. In each scenario, we obtain analytical expressions for the order, inventory, and satisfied demand distributions. This allows us to quantify the Bullwhip and inventory variance amplification ratios as well as the fill rate and the inventory cover. We show the lost sales nonlinearity induces complex behaviours in inventory systems. Interestingly, lost sales smooth supply chain dynamics, significantly affecting the trade-off between service level and average inventory holding. We also reveal the inventory downsides of demand censoring and the production damages induced by dynamic forecasts. We identify a key parameter, the relative safety margin, that characterises the performance of lost-sales systems.

Using a quantitative sample of 279 UK companies from across a variety of industry sectors, statistical techniques were utilized to examine the effect of informal and formal socialization mechanisms on the culture of a strategic supplier as measured by their organizational practices and the subsequent supplier performance outcomes. It was found that both informal and formal socialization efforts by a buyer organization have a significant influence on the culture of the supplier organization as measured by their organizational practices. Socialization efforts by the buyer organization influence the organizational practices of the supplier to be more result-oriented, employee-centred, open, pragmatic to customer needs and market focussed. These organizational practices were found to positively influence supplier operational performance in the eyes of the buyer organization as measured by on time delivery, conformance to product specifications, flexibility to respond to changing customer needs and cost reduction initiatives. Modelling the influence of informal and formal socialization efforts by a buyer on the organizational culture of a key supply chain partner provides new insights to academics. Firstly, this work makes a significant contribution to the extant research on socialization in the supply chain literature. Secondly, it raises the importance of understanding the influence of culture on supplier operational performance. Although the study used a dyadic method to validate the cultural insights, our study only took a snapshot of culture at one point in time. Organization culture as displayed through organizational practices is a complex construct that changes over time. Therefore, to further understand the intricacies of organization culture, a longitudinal study would be useful in the future. Secondly, future studies could develop into themes such as the green supply chain and sustainability issues. Finally, our study was undertaken in the UK. It would be useful to replicate this study in a different setting, including Eastern countries. Organizations should engage early with their key supply base from a socialization perspective. The importance of joint away days, cross function teams alongside effective communication and on site visits have been fund to have a significant influence on shaping a high performance culture along the supply chain. Therefore, a buyers’ early understanding of their key supplier’s culture via these mechanisms appear critical for long-term supply chain success. Measuring supplier culture at the visible level of organizational practices removes the ethereal qualities often attributed to culture as a concept; buyers can influence supplier culture.

A fundamental tool for this undertaking is data envelopment analysis (DEA). The conventional setting for DEA views the decision-making unit (DMU) (school, hospital etc.) as a black box with inputs entering and outputs leaving. The current paper looks at a problem setting somewhat related to a multistage situation but pertaining to a particular form of hierarchical structure. Specifically, we examine a set of electric power units that act as sub-units or sub-DMUs, operating under the framework of set of power plants that play the role of DMUs. We develop a DEA-like methodology that evaluates, in a two-stage manner, both the efficiencies of the sub-units and of the aggregates of those sub-units (the plants). In so doing, the approach attempts to have the projected values of plant-level inputs and outputs match up with the corresponding aggregate values of the sub-unit projections, as is the case prior to projection to the frontier. Since such projections may in fact not match up as described, we introduce a goal-DEA methodology to minimise the extent of any failure to achieve this match up. © Operational Research Society 2020.","DEA; efficiency; hierarchy; power plants; sub-units","Aggregates; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Electric power plants; Black boxes; Competitive environment; Dea methodologies; Decision making unit; Efficiency measurement; Electric power; Fundamental tools; Hierarchical structures; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083556368

In the real world, however, observations may display a stochastic behavior. To the best of our knowledge, despite the existing research done with different data types, studies on two-stage processes with stochastic data are still very limited. This article proposes a two-stage network DEA model with stochastic data. The stochastic two-stage network DEA model is formulated based on the satisficing DEA models of chance-constrained programming and the leader–follower concepts. According to the probability distribution properties and under the assumption of the single random factor of the data, the probabilistic form of the model is transformed into its equivalent deterministic linear programming model. In addition, the relationship between the two stages as the leader and the follower, respectively, at different confidence levels and under different aspiration levels, is discussed. The proposed model is applied to a real case concerning 16 commercial banks in China in order to confirm the applicability of the proposed approach. © Operational Research Society 2020.","chance-constrained model; efficiency; satisficing DEA; Stochastic DEA; two-stage system","Computer programming; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Linear programming; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Chance-constrained model; Chance-constrained programming; Decision making unit; Linear programming models; Satisficing; Stochastic behavior; Stochastic DEA; Two stage system; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082434582

In this paper, we consider a two-layer caching network, consisting of traditional macro-cell base station (MBS) aided back-haul channels and small-cell base stations (SBSs) aided local links. The network service provider (NSP), who is in charge of the two layers, leases its resources of the secondary layer, i.e., coverage of the SBSs, to content providers (CPs) for making extra profits and releasing pressures on the back-haul channels. At the same time, CPs will evaluate whether they are provided with proper incentives to pre-cache their files in the SBSs. Considering different quality of services (QoS) provided by the two layers as well as the economical impact of the traditional layer on the secondary layer, the NSP designs the optimal incentive mechanisms within the framework of contract theory for maximizing its own profits. First, we formulate the utility of the NSP and CPs. Then, the minimum transmission requirement, reserve price and limited resources are considered as constraints in designing the optimal contract. Also, some important properties of these constraints are analyzed to facilitate the optimal contract determination process. At last, an optimal contract determination scheme is proposed, based on which the optimal coverage set is determined first, and then the corresponding optimal prices are derived with the aid of equal cost line. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal contract in increasing the NSP's profits and incentivizing CPs to transmit on the secondary layer. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Contract theory; incentive mechanism design; two-layer networks; wireless edge caching","Base stations; Computer science; Contracts; Numerical models; Profitability; Quality of service; Contract Theory; Edge caching; Incentive mechanism; Two-layer network; Uncertainty; Wireless communications; Network layers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057198378

In the domain of project forecasting, Reference Class Forecasting has been introduced as a method to bypass human judgement by applying an uplift that is based on the forecast errors of similar historical projects. In this research study, we aim to identify the possible drivers of project similarity based on interviews with 76 project managers. Also, we evaluate the performance of Reference Class Forecasting as a project forecasting technique from both a cost and time perspective. Based on an empirical study of 52 real projects, the accuracy of Reference Class Forecasting is successfully demonstrated by implementing a method that considers both the intra- and inter-accuracy of reference classes. The accuracy increases when more project properties are considered, however, a higher number of project properties decreases the size of the reference classes and thus reduces the reliability of the results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Project forecasting; Project management; Project similarity; Real project data; Reference class forecasting","Managers; Project management; Cost estimations; Cost-overruns; Project delays; Project forecasting; Project managers; Project similarities; Property; Real project data; Reference class forecasting; Time estimation; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108577146

In the data, a shock to global temperature dampens research and development (R&D) expenditure growth. This novel empirical evidence is rationalized within a stochastic endogenous growth model. In the model, temperature shocks undermine economic growth via a drop in R&D expenditure. We examine three theoretical channels of the negative R&D expenditure effect of rising temperatures: the patent obsolescence channel, the labor productivity channel, and the capital quality channel. Temperature risk generates welfare costs of 93.14% of lifetime utility in this benchmark model. Moreover, the government can offset these welfare costs by subsidizing investment with 7.04% or R&D expenditure with 3.81% of total public spending, respectively. Alternatively, it can levy a lump-sum tax on households which finances 6.90% of total public spending, reduce corporate taxes by 3.62 percentage points, or increase labor taxes by 2.80 percentage points. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Capital quality; Endogenous growth; Global temperature; Labor productivity; Patent obsolescence; R&D expenditure; Welfare costs","Costs; Economics; Patents and inventions; Productivity; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Taxation; Capital quality; Endogenous growth; Global development; Global temperatures; Labour productivities; Patent obsolescence; Percentage points; Research and development expenditure; Rising temperatures; Welfare costs; Obsolescence; economic growth; expenditure; financial system; governance approach; investment; labor productivity; macroeconomics; model test; public spending; research and development; theoretical study; welfare economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117816827

Globally, four core technologies have been ranked high for most of the countries: networks/telecommunications, business intelligence/analytics, enterprise application integration, and mobile and wireless applications. There were also differences among countries. Statistical analyses were performed to analyze the nature of these differences based on the economic level of the country and its IT infrastructure capability. Further insights were generated by performing cluster analysis; grouping the countries into three clusters (optimizers, pragmatists, and progressives), and examining their characteristics and technology priorities. These results are useful for multinational companies, governments, and international agencies as they forge their technology strategies and make investment decisions. We also lay the foundation for ongoing research to better understand the contextual factors that explain the differences in technology priorities among nations. © 2021","Cluster analysis; Global IT landscape; Information technology priorities; IT infrastructure capability; Key IT issues","International cooperation; Investments; Global IT landscape; Information technology issues; Information technology priority; Issues and challenges; IT infrastructure capability; IT infrastructures; IT professional; IT project; Key IT issue; Technology challenges; Cluster analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117809599

Using panel data fixed effect with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors estimation approach, our results show that an oil boom causes appreciation in the real exchange rate and a fall in sectoral output, which is consistent with the theory. However, there is significant difference in the effects of oil boom on the real exchange rate and sectoral output among sub-regional groupings, possibly because of differences in the extent of institutional quality and economic policy. The implications of these results are that policy makers of countries affected by Dutch disease should improve institutional quality, minimise real exchange rate appreciation and promote domestic investment in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. These are necessarily conditions to escape the Dutch disease problem, which hinders economic growth and development. © 2021 The Authors","Cross-sectional dependence; Dutch disease; Fixed effect with driscoll and kraay standard errors; Oil boom","Agricultural robots; Developing countries; Economics; Finance; Cross sectional dependence; Dutch disease; Empirical analysis; Exchange rates; Fixed effect with driscoll and kraay standard error; Fixed effects; Institutional qualities; Panel data; Real exchange rate; Standard errors; Oil booms; developing world; empirical analysis; error analysis; exchange rate; global economy; oil supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115619366

The proliferation of e-commerce and digital businesses is not only changing the rules of business but disrupting them by introducing new possibilities, especially with the integration of new technology. Studies that have attempted to measure technology-based service quality in retail settings are limited to online service experiences, creating a significant gap in the literature. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore how the service quality of brick-and-mortar clothing retail chains can be improved using innovative technology such as smart mirror fashion technology (SMFT), something academic research has not yet specifically addressed. This study used a qualitative approach with Soft System Methodology (SSM), based upon interviews triangulated with observations and field notes. It focused on the top five UK clothing retail chains, measured by market capitalisation. We found that the quality of service received is currently perceived as low when compared to customers’ expectations; however, use of technology enhanced service quality and influenced customer satisfaction. There was a positive relationship between service quality, customer satisfaction and the use of SMFT. The contribution of this study lies in the development of a new framework that integrates SMFT with traditional in-store transaction processes, resulting in improvements in service delivery and managerial practices of the offline clothing retail service providers. The study concludes that embracing SMFT can help provide high-quality service, creating value for customers. © 2021","Brick-and-mortar store; Innovation; Offline retail; Service quality; Smart mirror fashion technology","Brick; Customer satisfaction; Mirrors; Mortar; Quality of service; Brick-and-mortar store; Customers' satisfaction; Enterprise IS; Innovation; Offline; Offline retail; Retail chains; Service Quality; Small-and-medium enterprise; Smart mirror fashion technology; Sales; clothing industry; consumption behavior; innovation; qualitative analysis; retailing; service quality; small and medium-sized enterprise; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114830977

Data from a sample of current and potential clients of a large retailer of photovoltaics (PV) systems is used to study how different information sources and different information channels affect both the intention to adopt and the actual purchasing decision of the customers. This research challenges the notion that providing more information always supports the adoption of environmental technologies. Drawing upon innovation diffusion theories and the theory of sustainable consumer behavior change, this analysis indicates that different information types and different channels have different effects. This research also finds that the impact of information changes throughout the adoption process, as potential technology adopters move from being indifferent to developing sustainable attitude, and then from displaying sustainable attitude to actually making an adoption decision. Generic information facilitates the development of sustainable attitude, but it is relatively ineffective in supporting adoption. Likewise, information obtained from commercial channels supports sustainable attitude, but it does not increase the likelihood of displaying sustainable behavior. Only information obtained from unbiased third party sources favors adoption. This research contributes to clarifying the “attitude–behavior gap” in the context of environmental technology adoption; while the findings have critical implications for policymakers and technology providers in optimizing their marketing strategies and information campaigns to promote new environmental technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Empirical studies; Information characteristics; Innovation adoption; Renewable energy","Consumer behavior; Sales; Sustainable development; 'current; Adoption behavior; Adoption decision; Empirical studies; Information characteristic; Innovation adoption; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Sustainable technology; Technology adoption; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114776773

From an operations perspective, these practices should enable flexibility and reduce costs. However, from the perspective of most other social sciences, precarious work harms workers and should harm firm performance. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance implications of precarious work. We collected survey data in the UK from multiple respondents (operations and human resource managers) along with secondary data to explore how the use of precarious work affects a company's financial, operational and occupational health & safety performance. The results were mixed. Precarious work did not have a significant influence on occupational health & safety performance and had a negative relationship with cost performance. We also established an inverted u-shaped relationship between precarious work and flexibility and financial performance; low levels of precarious work improve flexibility and financial performance and high levels of precarious work harm both. Finally, we explored if high-performance work practices could moderate these relationships, but the results were mostly insignificant. The results suggest that firms only benefit from relatively low levels of adoption of precarious work. © 2021 The Authors.

Building upon the knowledge-based theory, we propose a model to examine the effects of the two architectures of social capital (entrepreneurial and cooperative) on individual dimensions of operational performance (quality, delivery, flexibility and cost). The hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling and data collected from 182 companies in Ireland. The results show that the cooperative social capital archetype supports the operational performance dimensions, while the entrepreneurial social capital archetype only impacts the cost dimension.

Exploratory analyses of the global retail sector show patterns largely consistent with conventional explanations of exit through divestment. We also provide the first large-scale empirical evidence consistent with redeployment motives of exit. In particular, by focusing on the potential for redeployment of fixed assets (i.e., physical stores) across portfolio businesses, results show that market exit is more likely when there are combinations of lower resource adjustment costs, higher external transaction costs, and positive inducements. Under the same conditions, we also document a strong correlation between the number of fixed assets of an exiting business and the growth in fixed assets of its surviving siblings. Managerial Summary: It is increasingly recognized that multibusiness firms have flexibility advantages over single-business rivals, because they have the option to redeploy resources across businesses. This flexibility is purported to inspire quicker exit from markets, even if empirical evidence is lacking. We test this conjecture on 3,082 retail chains across 106 countries and find evidence consistent with this view—each additional related sibling in a country raises the hazard of country exit by 11% relative to retail chains without siblings. Since it is difficult to distinguish whether exit occurs through resource redeployment or divestment, we identify a set of unique determinants for each exit mode. Our theoretical framework and empirical findings help managers reconcile when to exit using internal resource markets versus external markets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","corporate strategy; market exit; multibusiness firm; resource redeployment; retail sector","Commerce; Managers; Sales; Empirical findings; Exploratory analysis; Internal resources; Multibusiness firms; Resource adjustment; Strong correlation; Theoretical framework; Transaction cost; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104823235

The framework identifies burnout as a key mediating variable and salesperson grit as a coping mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data is gathered from 364 B2B salespeople and investigated using structural equation modeling in Mplus 8.2. Findings: The findings reveal adverse life events and their corresponding stress diminish a salesperson’s ability to manage customer relationships effectively through the mediators of reduced personal accomplishment and depersonalization. Thus, negative events of a personal nature can have a significant impact on salesperson outcomes and should be taken with the same level of seriousness as job-related stress. Furthermore, results show that salesperson grit provides mixed results as a coping mechanism. Practical implications: The findings indicate that practitioners should be mindful of the negative impact adverse life events can have on work-related outcomes. Organizations and sales managers must be intentional in managing relationships with their salespeople and strategic in the structure they use to manage customer relationships. Recommendations include the use of regular one-on-one meetings to open up a dialogue about work or personal issues the salesperson is experiencing and assigning multiple resources or staff to service valuable customers, thereby not relying on solitary salespeople.

While cost of labor is well understood, the revenue implications of having the right staffing level are hard to estimate. Moreover, these implications vary by store; hence, staffing levels should vary as well. Academic/practical relevance: We provide a novel method for setting store associate staffing at the individual store level. We discuss a field implementation that tested this methodology. Methodology: We use historical data on revenue and planned and actual staffing levels by store to estimate how revenue varies with the staffing level at each store. We disentangle the endogeneity between revenue and staffing levels by focusing on randomly occurring deviations between planned and actual labor. Using historical analysis as a guide, we validate these results by changing the staffing levels in a few test stores. We implement the results chain-wide and measure the impact in a large specialty retailer. Results: We find that the implementation validates predictions of the historical analysis. The implementation in 168 stores over six months produces a 4.5% revenue increase and a nearly $7.4 million annual profit increase. The impact of staffing level on revenue varies greatly by store. Managerial implications: Our paper makes three contributions to academic literature and to retail practice. First, we describe a process by which retailers can improve the most common industry practice: set store labor to be proportional to forecasted store revenue. Our proposed approach systematically sets the labor level in each store. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of that process via a field test and then via chain-wide implementation over a six-month time period. Finally, most retailers set store labor at the same level across stores, proportionate to revenue. We show that this is not the best approach because the revenue impact of store labor varies by store. The stores in our study that could benefit from relatively more labor were those with high potential demand, closely located competition for that demand, and experienced store managers. Overall, we provide the first simple but rigorous, field-tested approach that any retailer can use to increase revenue and profitability through better labor management.

In this work, we develop and implement a data-integrated decision support framework to aid hospitals in managing the delicate balance between readmission risk at discharge and ward congestion. We formulate a large-scale Markov decision process (MDP) that integrates a personalized readmission prediction model to dynamically prescribe both how many and which patients to discharge on each day. Because of patient heterogeneity and the fact that length of stay is not memoryless, the MDP has the curse of dimensionality. We leverage structural properties and an analytical solution for a special cost setting to transform the MDP into a univariate optimization; this leads to a novel, efficient dynamic heuristic. Furthermore, for our decision framework to be implementable in practice, we build a unified prediction model that integrates several statistical methods and provides key inputs to the decision framework; existing off-the-shelf readmission prediction models alone could not adequately parametrize our decision support. Through extensive counterfactual analyses, we demonstrate the value of our discharge decision tool over our partner hospital's historical discharge behavior. We also obtain generalizable insights by applying the tool to a broad range of hospital types through a high-fidelity simulation. Last, we showcase an implementation of our tool at our partner hospital to demonstrate broader applicability through our framework's plug-and-play design for integration with general hospital data systems and workflows. © 2021 INFORMS.","Approximation algorithms; Inpatient flow management; Large-scale Markov decision process (MDP); Readmission risk; State-dependent discharge; Tool implementation","Data integration; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Hospitals; Markov processes; Timing circuits; Flow management; Inpatient flow management; Large-scale markov decision process; Large-scales; Markov Decision Processes; Prediction modelling; Readmission risk; State-dependent; State-dependent discharge; Tool implementation; Approximation algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118300359

To test the association between consistency and performance in the claim management process, structural equipment modeling was conducted. The performance of a claim management process was measured by the frequencies of entitlement miss, time-bar miss, and lack of substantiation. The results showed that the more consistent the processes that are in place, the better the performance at the process level.

Despite knowledge of SD as a potential threat to the validity of information systems (IS) research, little has been done to systematically assess its extent. Furthermore, we are uncertain of how to recover reliable estimates of the relationships between research variables contaminated by SD bias. We sought in this study to assess the extent of SD bias in causal inferences when independent and/or dependent variables are contaminated. We also evaluated whether an SD scale in conjunction with partial correlation could effectively and efficiently correct SD bias when it is found. To achieve these purposes, we designed a survey study and collected data from Amazon's Mechanical Turk in the context of mobile loafing, which refers to employees’ personal use of the mobile Internet during business hours. Using various detection methods, we found that SD bias existed in the context of mobile loafing. From the results of the variance reduction rate and a covariate technique, we found that SD bias becomes problematic when both the independent and dependent variables are susceptible to SD bias. Overall, our study contributes significantly to the IS literature by revealing the extent of SD bias and the magnitude of the possible correction for it in IS research. © 2021","Balanced inventory of desirable responding; Correlation; Covariate technique; Factor mixture model; Indirect questioning; Mobile loafing; Self-report survey; Social desirability bias; Social desirability scale; Variance reduction rate","Information use; Surveys; Amazon's mechanical turks; Dependent variables; Detection methods; Partial correlation; Potential threats; Reliable estimates; Social desirability; Variance reductions; Information systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111050350

Suitable graphical visualizations are necessary to support managers in understanding, evaluating, and comparing the performances of management decisions according to all objectives in all plausible scenarios. To date, no appropriate visualization has been suggested. This paper fills this gap by proposing two visualization methods: a novel extension of empirical attainment functions for scenarios and an adapted version of heatmaps. They help a decision-maker in gaining insight into realizations of trade-offs and comparisons between objective functions in different scenarios. Some fundamental questions that a decision-maker may wish to answer with the help of visualizations are also identified. Several examples are utilized to illustrate how the proposed visualizations support a decision-maker in evaluating and comparing solutions to be able to make a robust decision by answering the questions. Finally, we validate the usefulness of the proposed visualizations in a real-world problem with a real decision-maker. We conclude with guidelines regarding which of the proposed visualizations are best suited for different problem classes. © 2021 The Authors","Empirical attainment function; MCDM; Multi-dimensional visualization; Scenario planning; Scenario-based multi-criteria optimization; Uncertainty","Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Function evaluation; Managers; Visualization; Decision makers; Decision supports; Empirical attainment function; MCDM; Multi-objectives optimization; Multidimensional visualization; Scenario Planning; Scenario-based; Scenario-based multi-criteria optimization; Uncertainty; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110469321

(3) It includes operating costs and customer perspectives together to evaluate the channel structures. (4) This study uses a real-world case study approach to implement the proposed model in a U.S. multichannel company producing scientific, biotechnology cameras. The feedback from the managers who participated in the budget allocation process confirmed the utility of this approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Channel-level cost-benefit analysis; Customer-driven resource allocation decision; Multichannel retailing","consumption behavior; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; management; model; resource allocation; retailing; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109502312

We replicate their study across geographic and temporal contexts using three sets of data: from Finland (N = 884) in 2006–2008 and from other European countries in two different time periods (N = 36,480 in 2006–2008 and 24,326 in 2008–2010). Our results largely corroborate their core findings of the direct effects. We also find no evidence of diminishing returns to the breadth of innovation objectives, and we find at best slight evidence of diminishing returns to the breadth of knowledge sources. However, we find evidence of a significant negative interaction between knowledge sources and innovation objectives, contrary to Leiponen and Helfat's (2010) finding of a lack of evidence in a positive interaction. The new evidence of a negative interaction effect suggests that the positive effect of breadth in knowledge sources can also diminish contingent upon the breadth of innovation objectives. Managerial Summary: Companies are increasingly searching for new sources of knowledge while simultaneously pursuing multiple strategic innovation objectives. The results of our analysis from two multicountry datasets show that increased number of knowledge sources and strategic objectives are likely to result in higher innovation performance, that is, increased revenue from new products or increased likelihood of new product introduction. However, simultaneously pursuing greater number of strategic objectives while seeking knowledge from a greater number of sources may not result in greater innovation success. Consequently, managers should either focus on a narrow set of objectives while increasing their search breadth or pursue a broader set of objectives while focusing on fewer sources of knowledge. There is evidence of slight reduction in the ability to introduce new products when firms pursue more than eight knowledge sources. Otherwise, there is no evidence of diminishing returns of knowledge sources on revenue from new products or diminishing returns of objectives on innovation performance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","diminishing returns; innovation objectives; innovation performance; knowledge sources; quasi-replication","Managers; European Countries; Innovation performance; Negative interaction; New product introductions; Number of sources; Positive interaction; Strategic innovations; Strategic objectives; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106596529

On average, I find a positive association between financial reporting and capital raised, suggesting that accounting reduces information asymmetry with potential investors. Additionally, the importance of financial reporting in equity crowdfunding varies predictably in the cross-section. Specifically, financial reporting is associated with greater capital raised when the firm has longer historical operations, during periods of higher macroeconomic uncertainty, and when complemented by detailed shareholder agreements. Finally, using a mediation analysis, I find evidence that financial reporting is indirectly associated with better ex post performance by increasing the likelihood of raising capital.

We find that fiscal policy is the most aggressive when economic growth is emphasized as a policy objective, whereas monetary policy is relatively more aggressive when the inflation rate is emphasized. Given that the US inflation rate was below target for the start of the simulation exercises, when it is emphasized, that leads to lower interest rates, a depreciated exchange rate, and larger aggregate investment.

The findings contribute by revealing a paradox and a symbiosis that can advance the circular economy (CE). This paradox begins when suppliers reduce their own food disposal by offering benefits to supermarkets, which helps to sell items close to their expiration date. However, these benefits may induce supermarkets to place orders that exceed their sales capacity. When supermarkets do not sell these items before their expiration date, the products tend to be returned to the supplier, thus reducing the supermarket's waste but increasing the supplier's waste. These actions reveal a paradox: reducing PPFD in one link of the supply chain may exacerbate it in another. “Industry-Retail symbiosis” can improve the CE. Such symbiosis emerges when suppliers reduce their margins to offer additional benefits to supermarkets. These additional benefits improve supermarkets' sales to consumers with lower purchasing power or to smaller retailers that may use the items immediately, thus avoiding the return of items which are still suitable for human consumption and thereby improving the CE. Future studies could investigate: how to enhance Industry-Retail Symbiosis; what managerial information is required to use technologies to align products, stocks, prices, and stores; how suppliers can best manage the benefits offered to retailers or their partnerships with other suppliers (e.g., a shared sales center to improve symbiosis with retailers); and how retailers can best manage alternative sales channels and store managers' autonomy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Food waste; Industry-retail; Paradox; Supermarket; Symbiosis","Managers; Processed foods; Sales; Supply chains; Thermal processing (foods); Circular economy; Emerging economies; Food waste; Human consumption; Industry-retail; Paradox; Purchasing power; Semi structured interviews; Supermarket sales; Symbiosis; Retail stores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112301106

In pursuit of this objective, numerous studies have collectively identified a plethora of barriers inhibiting construction project management sustainable transition. While such knowledge is instructive, it presents its own barrier as prevailing challenges cannot be tackled simultaneously and redressing barriers individually (and in isolation) has proven ineffective. This research therefore seeks to examine the interrelationship and dependency of these barriers, doing so in the context of the Iranian construction industry, and by using statistical means to identify underlying meta-barrier factors. Extracted from the extant literature, thirty initial barriers are defined and delineated to inform a survey data collection instrument delivered to Iranian industry experts. Of 454 questionnaires distributed to construction professionals, 176 valid responses were returned and Social Network Analysis (SNA) tools were adopted to analyse the data. Five core thematic clusters of barriers were observed to impede the industry's project management sustainability transition, namely: 1) project context; 2) knowledge; 3) investment; 4) community; and 5) strategy. Based upon these five meta clusters of barriers, future industry and government policies could set frameworks for moving towards sustainability and identify the root causes of the failure in their projects' sustainable practices. The research concludes by delineating future direction for further research investigation. This study contributes to the field through analysing the linkages between barriers and distils them into five broad problem sets. This method provides a more manageable approach and offers industry practitioners in Iran holistic insight on how to effect positive change towards sustainable project management practices, and in turn, a sustainable construction industry. In so doing, the study provides lessons for other developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Correlation network analysis; Developing country; Green project management; Green projects; Project delivery","Construction industry; Correlation methods; Electric network analysis; Information management; Project management; Social networking (online); Surveys; Sustainable development; Construction project management; Construction sectors; Correlation network analyse; Green project; Green project management; Iranian construction industries; Project delivery; Project management practices; Social Network Analysis; Sustainable project managements; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111968850

Guidance on estimating the parameters of a continuous-time demand process from period demand data is lacking, in particular for the popular and well-studied compound Poisson class of demand. Whereas the statistics literature typically focuses on asymptotic properties, parameters for inventory control have to be estimated based on a limited number of periodic historical demand observations. We show that the standard Method-of-Moments (MM) estimator – the default choice in applied inventory control research – is severely biased for finite samples. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator – which needs to be obtained by a numerical search – performs better, but both estimators lack robustness to misspecification of the demand size distribution. We propose an intuitive, consistent, closed-form MM alternative that dominates standard MM and ML in terms of estimation accuracy and on-target inventory performance. Its closed form does not depend on the specific demand size distribution, making it robust and easily applicable in large-scale applications with many items. In a case study, we find that the accuracy loss due to storing demand periodically is four times as high under standard MM as under the proposed estimator. © 2021 The Author(s)","Compound Poisson demand; Forecasting; Inventory control; Probability","article; forecasting; inventory control; maximum likelihood method; probability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107287306

Using the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of projects funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Small Business Innovation Research program, a two-stage competitive process, we find that the result of selection of the first round is a tendency toward larger companies. In the second round of funding, technology maturity is a stronger determinant of selection and company headcount is no longer a statistically significant driver.This combination allows the program to manage risk and deliver real technical advancement fromeven the smallest companies. We find that technologies typically advance from TRL 2, concept formulation, at the program's outset to roughly TRL 5, component validation, at the program's conclusion; these outcomes precede economic benefits from the subsidy. These findings illuminate a mechanism to address risk as well as demonstrating the technical outcomes of a managed early-stage technology program. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

We build a framework that revolves around the ADMS lifecycle and propose that each phase challenges organizations with “choices” related to technical and processual characteristics – ways to design, implement and use these systems in practice. We argue that it is important that organizations make these strategic choices with awareness and responsibly, as ADMS’ consequences affect a broad array of stakeholders (the workforce, suppliers, customers and society at-large) and involve ethical considerations. With this article we make two main contributions.

We begin by documenting the growth of dollar stores over time and comparing dollar store expansion between areas with and without poor food access. Using a time-varying measure of food accessibility, we identify areas with persistent food access challenges, where supermarket and large grocery stores have been absent for the entire study period (2000–2017), and track dollar store expansion into these areas. We use a combination of geocoded food retail establishments from Nielsen's TDLinx dataset to identify the precise location and years of entry for dollar stores and create yearly measures of food accessibility. We find that dollar stores are most prevalent in non-metro areas, regardless of food access status. We find that both the presence and entry of dollar stores are not more likely to be associated with areas categorized as “low-income and low-access”; however, we do find evidence that once a dollar store enters a food desert, that area is more likely to remain without access to a supermarket. Our results indicate that dollar stores are similar to other profit-seeking food retailers in that they are more likely to locate in areas where supermarkets exist and competition is high, suggesting that dollar stores are becoming key players within the food retailing environment. Yet, unlike traditional retail formats, dollar stores could be filling a gap in food access in places where no other food retailer will enter. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dispersal policy; Dollar stores; Food access; Food deserts","accessibility; economic growth; food availability; food market; low income population; retailing; supermarket",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109450491

We calculate total cost of ownership and use (TCOU) to compare four alternatives: private manually driven vehicles, private automated vehicles, automated on-demand exclusive use mobility services (ridesourcing) and automated on-demand pooled mobility services (ridesplitting), for both conventional and electric propulsions. We also included potential usefulness of travel time in the driverless vehicles in the TCOU calculations, thus including some of the non-financial factors in travel decision making. While nearly all current studies are limited to comparing average representative trips or mileage of existing vehicles, we calculate TCOUs for every vehicle in the UK National Travel Survey dataset, considering heterogeneity in mileage patterns, trip purposes, time spent driving, value of time, vehicle age, depreciation and other factors between different vehicles. The results suggest that a near-total transition to automated ride services is highly unlikely, since ownership of (automated or manually driven) vehicles continues to be the least-cost option in most cases. Even in the most pro-mobility service test case, ownership remains more cost-effective for one third of the current vehicle fleet. Regression analysis shows that higher income of the main driver, business use of the vehicle, rural location of the household or being the main household vehicle leads to a higher likelihood that automated vehicle ownership will be lower cost compared to automated mobility services. Within automated on-demand ride services, exclusive use services are cost effective for more cases compared to pooled, shared-use type options, with uncertain consequences for future travel demand. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Car ownership; Driverless cars; Ridehailing; Ridesharing; Shared autonomous vehicles; Travel time costs","Automation; Autonomous vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Fleet operations; Regression analysis; Automated vehicles; Car ownership; Driverless cars; Mobility service; On demands; Ride-sharing; Ridehailing; Shared autonomous vehicle; Total cost of ownership; Travel time cost; Travel time; automation; car ownership; comparative study; cost analysis; public transport; socioeconomic status; travel time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109448570

To better understand the critical processes of Cd-related health risks and to inform mitigation policies, an assessment method was integrated by coupling source-soil-rice-human systems with anthropogenic Cd sources historical survey, regional soil Cd concentration surveyed data and an extensive literature review of Cd related human diseases. This method was subsequently applied to a rapid developing industrial and agricultural area in China. Results indicated that Cd emission sources increased fourfold from 1990 to 2007, and remained high value about 140 × 103 kg yr−1 after 2008 in the study region. The Cd fluxes in 1990–2017 varied from 3.93 to 73.49 mg m−2. Raw coal consumption contributed to approximately 50% of total Cd fluxes. During 2003–2013, the annual increasing rate of soil Cd varied from −2.34 μg kg−1yr−1 to 7.94 μg kg−1yr−1 with an average 5.14 μg kg−1yr−1. Under the current industry and agriculture developing trends, farmland soil in 2030 will face significant Cd pollution risks and the average soil Cd concentration will increase to 0.35 mg kg−1 which is 1.75 times higher than that of 2003. Consequently, higher Cd concentrations were predicted in rice grain and human blood. About 3.43% of adults may have obesity and hypertension, and approximately 4.96% of children will also be the risk of physical, cognitive neurobehavioral development. The mitigation strategies of Cd source reduction and phytoremediation technology in rice system can significantly decrease Cd-related health risks. These strategies are far less effective in already heavily polluted soils. This study provides critical information on Cd emission factors, Cd related human diseases, and a novel useful tool for policy-makers on metals pollution management. © 2021","Cadmium contamination; Health risk; Mitigation solutions; Policy making; Prediction model","Agriculture; Bioremediation; Decision making; Risk assessment; Soil pollution; Soil pollution control; Soils; Surveys; Cadmium contamination; Cadmium flux; Human disease; Mitigation solution; Policy making; Prediction model; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Rice cropping systems; Risks management; Soil cadmiums; Health risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107932142

Specifically, the authors ask if the visual interface design of a non-SNS site affects the level to which the decisions made in that site are influenced by the decision maker’s SNAWB. Relating to theory on emotion and action readiness, this research hypothesizes on the expected effects of a visual interface design that includes elements that may trigger SNS-related emotions. To test the hypothesis, this paper conducts two experiments: 1) an online experiment and 2) a controlled lab experiment with eye-tracking. The results show that individuals’ decisions are affected by the level to which the website interface design may trigger SNS emotions. The results further provide evidence on the emotional process leading to different effects according to the type of decision made. © 2021 IGI Global.

However, the differential impacts of such social influence on developers' initial and sustained participation behaviors were largely overlooked in previous research. We empirically studied the impacts of two social influence mechanisms—word-of-mouth (WOM) and observational learning (OL)—on these two types of participation, using data collected from a large OSS development platform called Open Hub. We found that action (OL) speaks louder than words (WOM) with regard to sustained participation. Moreover, project age positively moderates the impacts of social influence on both types of participation. For projects with a higher average workload, the impacts of OL are reduced on initial participation but are increased on sustained participation. Our study provides a better understanding of how social influence affects OSS developers' participation behaviors. It also offers important practical implications for designing software development platforms that can leverage social influence to attract more initial and sustained participation. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.",,"Open source software; Open systems; Social sciences computing; Software design; Designing softwares; Developer activities; Development platform; Observational learning; Open source software projects; Social influence; Word of mouth; Economic and social effects; article; human; learning; software; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104065580

COVID-19 has created obstacles and uncertainty among municipalities, making it necessary for solid waste management organizations to enhance their capability to assess available resources and thereby quickly respond to changes. A hybrid method consisting of the fuzzy Delphi method, a fuzzy interpretive structural modeling matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification, and a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation method is proposed to structure the hierarchical framework and to transform uncertain and complex attributes into measurable attributes. There are 30 valid attributes arranged into 12 levels and grouped into 9 aspects of sustainable resource utilization. The results show that the policy and regulation framework has the greatest driving power, followed by information sharing and communication, occupational intervention, employment standards, and city parameter support. The linkage criteria, which have strong driving and dependence power in equilibrium interactions with other criteria and play an essential role in balancing the system, include the skills and capacities of in-house staff, working conditions and the environment, internal knowledge sharing and exchange, staff awareness and training, and the design of safety interventions; these criteria must be emphasized in practice. © 2021","Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling; Matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification; Resource dependence theory; Resource-based view; Sustainable solid waste management","Decision making; Knowledge management; Personnel training; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Crisis response; Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling; Hierarchical structures; Matrix of cross-impact multiplication applied to classification; Resource dependence theory; Resource-based view; Resources utilizations; Solid waste management; Sustainable solid waste management; Viet Nam; Waste management; classification; crisis management; decision making; Delphi analysis; fuzzy mathematics; response analysis; solid waste; sustainability; theoretical study; waste management; access to information; Article; artificial neural network; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; Delphi study; environmental decision making; environmental policy; hazardous waste; health care utilization; hospital waste; human; interpersonal communication; municipal waste; nonbiological model; occupational safety; pandemic; probability; resource utilization model; solid waste management; Viet Nam; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105494032

We further investigate how managerial ability impacts the association between firm innovativeness and competitive advantage. We employ two measures of managerial ability, namely strategic managerial ability and operational managerial ability. We find that firm innovativeness rises with strategic ability at an increasing rate. However, firm innovativeness initially falls and then rises with an increase in operational ability. Our results are consistent with the notion that a firm's innovation activity is a tradeoff between opportunity exploration and exploitation in that explorative and exploitative activities compete for manager's fixed attention. The greater the strategic ability of management, the more opportunity-focused they are, the greater is their risk tolerance, and the greater is the investment in research and development. Strategic managers seek and cultivate growth opportunities to resolve the uncertainty associated with the growth opportunities in the firm's favor, which enhances the firm's competitive advantage. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Competitive advantage; innovativeness; managerial ability; opportunity exploration; R&D; strategic leadership","Competition; Electric current measurement; Financial markets; Investments; Research and development management; Uncertainty analysis; Competitive advantage; Indexes; Innovativeness; managerial ability; Research and development; Strategic leadership; Technological innovation; Uncertainty; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069921599

We use detailed industry-level data to distinguish reallocations of working hours between industries from pure within-industry productivity gains or losses. We find that all three countries showed positive growth rates of aggregate output per hour in 2020 over 2019. However, after removing the effects from the reallocation of hours between low and high productivity industries, only the US still performed positively in terms of within-industry productivity growth. In contrast, the two European economies showed negative within-industry productivity growth rates in 2020. While above-average digital-intensive industries outperformed below-average ones in both France and the UK, the US showed higher productivity growth in both groups compared to the European countries. Industries with medium-intensive levels of shares of employees working from home prior to the pandemic made larger productivity gains in 2020 than industries with the highest pre-pandemic work-from-home shares. Overall, after taking into account the productivity collapse in the hospitality and culture sector during 2020, productivity growth shows no clear deviation from the slowing pre-pandemic productivity trend. Future trends in productivity growth will depend on whether the favourable productivity gains (or smaller losses) in industries with above-average digital intensity will outweigh negative effects from the pandemic, in particular scarring effects on labour markets and business dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digital transformation; Labour reallocation; Pandemic; Productivity; Work-from-home",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114777253

Yet, we know little about how this arrangement relates to worker productivity and fairness. Academic/practical relevance: We provide the first firm-based evidence that when service teams are allowed to allocate compensation internally, the ensuing peer-bargaining process can generate inequitable outcomes for women. Methodology: We demonstrate this using fixed-effect models to identify productivity and peer-bargaining traits in 932 workers at 32 large Chinese beauty salons. We measure individual productivity through service and prepaid card sales and measure bargaining through the division of team-based commissions. We also build a parsimonious bargaining model to explain our empirical results. Results: Although productivity and bargaining outcomes are positively correlated, female workers consistently receive bargaining outcomes below their productivity level, whereas men are consistently overcompensated. Importantly, we provide evidence that our results can only be explained by a combination of higher prosociality and lower bargaining power in women. We also demonstrate that the resulting inequity is positively correlated with shorter tenure. Managerial implications: Our findings provide unique organizational evidence on how bargaining among peers relates to productivity in service operations. We show that the discriminatory social dynamics observed throughout society are evident in operational designs that delegate decision rights to teams and that the magnitude in these systems is at least as large as that observed in traditional hierarchical pay systems. Managers must anticipate and mitigate this gender-based inequity because it is in and of itself an operational performance issue, and because of the myriad of productivity, retention, and ethical implications that can result from peer-based bargaining. © 2020 INFORMS.","Bargaining; Compensation; Fairness; Gender; Negotiation; Productivity; Service operations","Hierarchical systems; Managers; Service industry; Ethical implications; Fixed effect models; Individual productivity; Managerial implications; Operational design; Operational performance; Problem description; Worker productivities; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113973119

Customers with private willingness to pay sequentially request to relocate a resource from one location to another, and a revenue-maximizing service provider sets a price for each request. This problem can be formulated as an infinite-horizon stochastic dynamic program, but it is difficult to solve, as optimal pricing policies may depend on the locations of all resources in the network. We first focus on networks with a hub-and-spoke structure, and we develop a dynamic pricing policy and a performance bound based on a Lagrangian relaxation. This relaxation decomposes the problem over spokes and is thus far easier to solve than the original problem. We analyze the performance of the Lagrangian-based policy and focus on a supplyconstrained large network regime in which the number of spokes (n) and the number of resources grow at the same rate. We show that the Lagrangian policy loses no more than O(√In n/n) in performance compared with an optimal policy, thus implying asymptotic optimality as n grows large.We also showthat no static policy is asymptotically optimal in the large network regime. Finally, we extend the Lagrangian relaxation to provide upper bounds and policies to general networks with multiple interconnected hubs and spoke-to-spoke connections and to incorporate relocation times. We also examine the performance of the Lagrangian policy and the Lagrangian relaxation bound on some numerical examples, including examples based on data from RideAustin.

The assets of such banks have been growing twice as fast as those of conventional banks. Islamic banks do not depend on conventional interest, speculation, or complex derivatives stemming from banking operations. Instead, their actions in respect of profit/risk sharing, and the clarity of the contract are consistent with Islamic Sharī'ah principles, which seek to promote a more equal society. Purpose of the article: This research aims to identify and compare factors influencing the liquidity of Islamic and conventional banks in Europe. Candidate factors are sought amongst profitability, credit quality, credit expansion and capital adequacy indicators. Methodology: First, relevant financial ratios for 249 observations on Islamic banks and 2,306 observations on conventional banks are selected and compared for the period 2013–2017. Second, liquidity is explained separately for each type of banks by panel data regression to identify its determinants in a comparative context. Findings & value added: The results indicate that the impact of the net interest margin on the liquidity ratio of Islamic banks is insignificant, which is obviously due to the prohibition of the use of interest (riba). To the contrary, in conventional banking a higher net interest margin results in a reduction in liquidity. Capital adequacy has a positive influence upon liquidity in both types of banks, but in Islamic banking, the influence is 5.4 times greater. The findings strongly suggest that the liquidity of Islamic and conventional banks is affected by different factors. © 2021 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

Data were collected from the official Facebook and Twitter pages of 30 U.S. car brands from 2009 to 2015. We utilized a panel vector autoregressive model to investigate the dynamic relationships among multiple time series variables while controlling for influential durable goods characteristics. The empirical results suggest that Facebook and Twitter have heterogeneous effects on offline vehicle sales. Moreover, FGC is more effective than UGC for influencing offline light vehicle sales. Viral impressions from Facebook and Twitter are essential, although the effects vary by social media platform (Facebook versus Twitter) and content type (FGC versus UGC). The result of the impulse response function analysis indicates that both the firm’s marketing efforts (FGC and traditional media) and UGC have a long-term effect on offline sales, with the long-term effect of a firm’s marketing efforts outlasting that of UGC. Incorporating FGC and UGC from Facebook and Twitter and traditional media could improve the performance of offline sales prediction. We also documented the within-Twitter synergistic effect between FGC and UGC for offline car sales and cross-channel substitution relationships (FGC on both Facebook and Twitter serves as a substitution to traditional media). Finally, we provide guidance for managers seeking to leverage multichannel marketing to boost the offline sales of durable goods. © 2021 INFORMS","Facebook; FGC; Offline light vehicle sales; PVAR model; Traditional media; Twitter; U.S. automobile industry; UGC","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Impulse response; Light weight vehicles; Sales; Heterogeneous effects; Impulse response functions; Long-term effects; Multiple time series; Social media platforms; Synergistic effect; User generated content (UGC); Vector autoregressive model; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109144468

While tremendous efforts have been made in this direction, it is not clear how to model the influence of employees' turnover within multiple organizational social networks. In this article, we study how to exploit turnover contagion by developing a Turnover Influence-based Neural Network (TINN) for enhancing organizational turnover prediction. Specifically, TINN can construct the turnover similarity network which is then fused with multiple organizational social networks. The fusion is achieved either through learning a hidden turnover influence network or through integrating the turnover influence on multiple networks. Taking advantage of the Graph Convolutional Network and the Long Short-Term Memory network, TINN can dynamically model the impact of social influence on talent turnover. Meanwhile, the utilization of the attention mechanism improves the interpretability, providing insights into the impact of different networks along time on the future turnovers. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world settings to evaluate TINN. The results validate the effectiveness of our approach to enhancing organizational turnover prediction. Also, our case studies reveal some interpretable findings, such as the importance of each network or hidden state which potentially impacts future organizational turnovers. © 2021 ACM.","network fusion; social influence; Talent management; turnover prediction","Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional networks; Influence networks; Intellectual capital; Multiple networks; Real world setting; Similarity network; Talent management; Convolutional neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108909377

Existing studies have conducted surveys to estimate merchants' market share and factors of attractiveness to use in various proposed mathematical models. Recent trends in Big Data analysis allow us to better understand human behavior and decision making, potentially leading to location models with more realistic assumptions. In this article, we propose a novel approach for validating the Huff gravity market share model, using a large-scale transactional dataset that describes customer patronage behavior at a regional level. Although the Huff model has been well studied and widely used in the context of sales estimation, competitive facility location, and demand allocation, this article is the first in validating the Huff model with a real dataset. Our approach helps to easily apply the model in different regions and with different merchant categories. Experimental results show that the Huff model fits well when modeling customer shopping behavior for a number of shopping categories, including grocery stores, clothing stores, gas stations, and restaurants. We also conduct regression analysis to show that certain features such as gender diversity and marital status diversity lead to stronger validation of the Huff model. We believe we provide strong evidence, with the help of real-world data, that gravity-based market share models are viable assumptions for retail sales estimation and competitive facility location models. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","behavioral analytics; Big Data analysis; customer patronage behavior; Huff model; market share","Behavioral research; Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Estimation; Facilities; Large dataset; Location; Competitive facility location; Competitive facility location models; Demand allocation; Gender diversity; Market share model; Regional levels; Shopping behavior; Transactional data; Sales; commercial phenomena; human; marketing; Commerce; Humans; Marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108203308

Drawing on institutional theory, we hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between major customer and supplier inventory leanness and that this effect is moderated by compliant, reflexive, and normative isomorphic forces. Specifically, we contend that interdependence, uncertainty, and the age of the customer−supplier relationship strengthen the supplier's imitative behaviors and, thus, the assimilation to its major customer's inventory leanness. The hypotheses are tested empirically using a large panel data set of dyadic customer–supplier observations obtained from a variety of archival databases. The econometric analyses provide strong and robust evidence of interorganizational imitation in the domain of inventory management and, thus, document the role key customers play in shaping supplier firms' inventories.

This study explores the effects of real-time information sharing (RTIS) on downstream operations in three service sub-sectors that are dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - wholesale & retail, food & beverages, and accommodation. Drawing on information processing theory, we examine the differences in the adoption and perceived benefits for customers of RTIS through a survey of 221 middle-level managers from Malaysia. Our findings indicate that, overall, RTIS is significantly associated with customer purchase behavior (PB) in the presence of customer orientation (CO) that plays a two-fold mediating role in purchase and repurchase behavior. Our results also point to sectoral differences. RTIS—with customer PB and post-purchase behavior in the presence of CO—is more effective in the wholesale & retail and food & beverages sub-sectors than in accommodation.

In response, this study reviews the literature regarding 13 major agricultural standards, asking: where are certified crops being studied? Which sustainability outcomes and indicators are measured? And finally, what does the current evidence base suggest about VSS outcomes? The analysis of 45 peer-reviewed articles suggests a mismatch between what is certified and what is studied. Some crops and standards are over-represented in the literature as compared to their amount of certified production (e.g. coffee and Fairtrade certification), while others are under-represented (cotton, sugar, cocoa, soy, and palm oil, in addition to Organic certification). The review also identifies countries which appear to be under-represented in the literature, including Brazil, Australia, Malaysia, the Ivory Coast, and the United States. When measuring success, economic indicators are the most frequently evaluated, and only 20% of studies analyze economic, social, and environmental indicators simultaneously. When grouped by case, the indicator results tend to be positive on average (51%), followed by no difference (41%) and negative (8%) outcomes. There are no significant differences among sustainability pillars in terms of the average proportion of positive and negative results. These findings should be interpreted carefully, since the evidence base is heavily weighted towards coffee certification (75% of cases analyzed), and impacts are highly context dependent. Finally, the review identifies best practices in conducting robust evaluations, including the importance of addressing sustainability trade-offs and appropriately measuring environmental outcomes. While significant gaps remain, the findings indicate an increase in research credibly measuring VSS impacts. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Evidence synthesis; Impact evaluation; Voluntary sustainability standards","Agricultural robots; Crops; Economic and social effects; Palm oil; Sugar industry; Agricultural sustainability; Context dependent; Economic indicators; Environmental indicators; Environmental outcome; Impact evaluation; Systematic Review; Under-represented; Sustainable development; alternative agriculture; crop plant; economic conditions; environmental indicator; sustainability; trade-off; Australia; Brazil; Cote dIvoire; Malaysia; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101337501

We discuss three estimation strategies based on constructing a likelihood with unknown components. One approach is a three-step constrained semiparametric limited information maximum likelihood, where the first two steps provide local polynomial estimators of the reduced form and frontier equation. This approach imposes the shape restrictions on the frontier equation explicitly. As an alternative, we consider a local limited information maximum likelihood, where we replace the constrained estimation from the first approach with a kernel-based method. This means the shape constraints are satisfied locally by construction. Finally, we consider a smooth-coefficient stochastic frontier model, for which we propose a two-step estimation procedure based on local GMM and MLE. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate attractive finite sample properties of all the proposed estimators. An empirical application to the US banking sector illustrates empirical relevance of these methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Constrained semiparametric limited information MLE; Efficiency; Endogeneity; Local limited information MLE; Smooth coefficient; Stochastic frontier","banking; econometrics; efficiency measurement; maximum likelihood analysis; numerical model; parameter estimation; regression analysis; stochasticity; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091686949

To facilitate better understanding of the opportunities and challenges that CH presents, we conducted a systematic review of the literature linking CH with innovation-based competitive advantage. Initially, we synthesize extant CH literature to propose a multidimensional conceptualization and definition of the CH construct comprising three dimensions: customer need heterogeneity, customer knowledge heterogeneity, and customer relationship heterogeneity. Customer need heterogeneity refers to the extent to which customers’ needs/preferences for a product offering differ from each other, customer knowledge heterogeneity indicates the degree to which customers have different knowledge levels regarding how their needs can be satisfied, and customer relationship heterogeneity indicates the extent to which customers have different preferences toward engaging in relationships with the firm. Next, we present an integrative summary of the empirically tested as well as theoretically proposed links between each CH dimension and its antecedents/outcomes. Finally, we draw upon the paradox literature to identify specific tensions associated with each CH dimension and rely on the dynamic capabilities literature to suggest how these tensions can be effectively managed. Collectively, we contribute to the emerging resource-based perspective of CH by offering a propositional model of how CH can be managed for innovation-based competitive advantage. © 2021 Product Development & Management Association","customer heterogeneity; Innovation Strategy; theory of Paradox and dynamic capabilities","Competition; Public relations; Competitive advantage; Competitive strategy; Customer knowledge; Customer relationships; Dynamic capabilities; Multi-dimensional conceptualizations; Product offerings; Systematic Review; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106985432

Specifically, we examine whether founder gender preferences, if they exist, vary based on the gender and the experience of the investor. Through a randomized field experiment, we find that inexperienced female investors are significantly more interested (138%) in ventures with female founders than those with male founders; however, we do not observe founder gender preferences among experienced female investors. For male investors, we do not observe differences in interest based on founder gender or investor experience. Thus, we confirm that the gender gaps observed in traditional equity financing are ameliorated in the equity crowdfunding context. Furthermore, we identify a boundary condition to the preference for female founders reported in earlier work involving low-stakes crowdfunding. In high-stakes crowdfunding, investor experience serves as a contingency that reduces female investors’ preference for female founders, potentially because of the weakening effects of activism homophily and the lower reliance on heuristics as investor experience increases. © 2020 INFORMS.","Crowdfunding; Entrepreneurial finance; Gender gaps; New ventures; Randomized field experiment","Crowdsourcing; Equity financing; Female entrepreneurs; Field experiment; Homophily; Weakening effect; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106734764

Water-sensitive strategies and water-sensitive urban design and planning can manage stormwaters through multifunctional retention ponds; however, urban professionals seek an assessment model that evaluates and quantifies the performance of multifunctional retention ponds on stormwater management. This research has developed the Urban Retention Pond Index (URPI) assessment model, a universal multi-layered decision-support tool that constitutes three criteria (C1. Geotechnical functions, C2. Water quality and treatment, and C3. Structural and physical landscaping functions), and twenty sub-criteria. Employing Analytical Network Process (ANP) has determined the weights of indicators, which formulated the URPI index. The ANP result indicated soil investigation (WC1.1 = 0.170), soil retention (WC2.1 = 0.156), and infiltration rate (WC1.2 = 0.108) could extensively impact to the performance of multifunctional retention ponds. To validate the model, it was implemented in the Boneyard Creek retention pond using the Weighted Sum Method. The assessment analysis assigned grade A to this site, meaning, Boneyard Creek pond manages stormwater mainly through Soils Investigation (WC1.1 = 0.150), Soil retention (WC2.1 = 0.144), and Infiltration Rate (WC1.2 = 0.091). Furthermore, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) was conducted to analyze the URPI model's input–output uncertainty and effect of variations, through a series of methods; Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF), Probability Density Function (PDF), Scatterplot-Histogram Plot, Box-Whisker Plot, and Parallel Coordination. GSA could support the dominant controls and robust decision-making of the URPI model. GSA results determined that model outputs are empirically distributed with minor regression variance to the theoretical distribution. Most of the outputs fall within the intervals where the mean and median are more significant than the mode. The multiple regression analysis has shown that the three criteria are positively and linearly correlated. The Box-Whisker plots revealed the behaviors of the four mentioned measures are similar. Notably, the Box-Whisker standard error plots indicated the minor errors of the outputs in the whole network of the URPI model. Meanwhile, the Parallel Coordination indicated the largest centrality degrees by the spillway and landscape habitat retention sub-criteria and the largest Eigenvector centralities by soil retention and soil investigation sub-criteria in the whole network. © 2021","Analytical Network Process (ANP); Decision-support model; Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA); Multifunctional retention pond; Stormwater management; Water-sensitive urban design and planning","Decision making; Decision support systems; Distribution functions; Engineering geology; Infiltration; Lakes; Probability density function; Soils; Storm sewers; Storms; Uncertainty analysis; Urban planning; Water quality; Water treatment; Analytical network processes (ANP); Cumulative distribution function; Decision support models; Eigenvector centralities; Global sensitivity analysis; Multiple regression analysis; Probability density function (pdf); Water sensitive urban designs; Sensitivity analysis; analytical method; assessment method; decision support system; error analysis; flood; infiltration; motorway; multiple regression; performance assessment; pond; urban area; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101127543

It shows that a single market process unleashed by the decline of unionization can account for both the macro- and micro-economic phenomena, and that deunionization can be modeled as an endogenous outcome of competition between high wage firms seeking to raise productive capacity and low productivity firms seeking to cut wages. The model highlights the antipodal competitive dynamics between a ""winner-takes-all economy""in which corporate strategies focused on cost reductions lead to divergence in productivity and wages and a ""social market economy""in which competition rewards the accumulation of firm-level capabilities and worker skills with a more egalitarian wage structure. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

We have found that whereas the company appreciates the advantages of dynamic pricing, they deem it operationally much easier to plan out a static price calendar in advance. We investigate the efficacy of static control policies for revenue management problems whose optimal solution is inherently dynamic. In these problems, a firm has limited inventory to sell over a finite time horizon, over which heterogeneous customers stochastically arrive. We consider both pricing and assortment controls, and derive simple static policies in the form of a price calendar or a planned sequence of assortments, respectively. In the assortment planning problem, we also differentiate between the static vs. dynamic substitution models of customer demand. We show that our policies are within 1-1/e (approximately 0.63) of the optimum under stationary demand, and 1/2 of the optimum under nonstationary demand, with both guarantees approaching 1 if the starting inventories are large. We adapt the technique of prophet inequalities from optimal stopping theory to pricing and assortment problems, and our results are relative to the linear programming relaxation. Under the special case of stationary demand single-item pricing, our results improve the understanding of irregular and discrete demand curves, by showing that a static calendar can be (1-1/e)-approximate if the prices are sorted high-to-low. Finally, we demonstrate on both data from the CPG company and synthetic data from the literature that our simple price and assortment calendars are effective. © 2020 INFORMS","Analysis of algorithms; Empirical pricing; Inventory-production policies; Pricing; Suboptimal algorithms","Economics; Linear programming; Sales; Assortment planning; Dynamic substitution; Finite time horizon; Linear programming relaxation; Non-stationary demand; Optimal solutions; Optimal stopping theories; Revenue management; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105341920

This paper focuses on improving the selection of a design-build contractor by modeling the inherent uncertainties associated with open tendering. Although there are numerous methods for selecting a contractor, few consider, and even fewer have accounted for, random uncertainties associated with open tendering. In the absence of a structured approach that includes cognitive uncertainty modeling, the risk of choosing a subpar contractor and consequent project failure increases. Cloud theory uses a normal distribution membership function to infuse fuzzy set theory with probability theory. The application of cloud theory in a case study to order the preferred contractors improves decision-making quality and, consequently, confidence in the derived outcome where uncertainty exists. By accounting for both fuzzy and random uncertainties expressed by decision makers, this formulation for contractor selection increases the potential to achieve client performance goals. The proposed new approach reduces the risk of project failure by offering a unique understanding of how to more efficiently choose a design-build contractor. It narrows the model prediction and practice gap by providing an alternative to selecting the lowest bidder. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cloud computing; Decision theory; Expert system; Fuzzy set; Multicriteria; Uncertainty","Decision making; Decision theory; Distribution functions; Fuzzy set theory; Membership functions; Model buildings; Normal distribution; Uncertainty analysis; Contractor selection; Model prediction; Probability theory; Project failures; Random uncertainties; Risk of projects; Structured approach; Uncertainty modeling; Contractors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100724422

However, whether and to what extent the Outward FDI (OFDI) influences the domestic LSI remains an untapped research area. This study attempts to quantify the OFDI-induced productivity spillover effects in the context of China's LSI by leveraging the most up-to-date data in conjunction with advanced econometric techniques. Our study reveals that the OFDI of logistics enterprises poses a distinctly positive impact on productivity growth in the logistics industry, and that this impact has been further strengthened since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. We also demonstrate a long-term bidirectional causality between the logistics enterprises' OFDI and the growth of productivity in the domestic LSI. It implies that enhancing global connectivity and supply chain collaborations requires an effective and efficient logistics operation and management, which in turn provides more opportunities to accrue positive productivity spillovers. The results remain robust with various datasets, specifications, and estimators. The study provides novel insights into the improvement of logistics efficiency through OFDI-facilitated technological spillovers and resource acquisition.

However, the search literature typically only models one pass search across stores, ignoring revisits to stores; the choice literature using scanner data has modeled search across time, but not search across stores in the same model. We develop a multipass search model that jointly endogenizes search in both dimensions; our model nests a finite horizon model of search across stores within an infinite horizon model of intertemporal search. We apply our model to milk purchases at grocery stores; hence, the model also accounts for repeat purchases across time, inventory holding by households, and grocery basket effects. We note that the special case without these additional features can be used to study one-time purchases with repeat store visits as in the case of durable goods and online shopping. We formulate the empirical model as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints and estimate it allowing for latent class heterogeneity using an iterative expectation-maximization algorithm. In contrast to extant research, we find that omitting the temporal dimension underestimates price elasticity.

By extending these studies, this paper hypothesizes that the performance effects of different green practices (that emphasize operations and product/market innovation) depend on the types of internal and external collaboration. The hypotheses are tested through a survey of manufacturers in China (Hong Kong) and the United Kingdom. As expected, green product design and packaging practices (emphasize innovation) create environmental and cost benefits when there are high levels of internal and external collaboration. Instead, green production, sourcing, and logistics practices (emphasize operations) create performance when the levels of internal and external collaboration are low. Only green production creates financial/market performance at a high level of stakeholder collaboration. These results show that it is important to distinguish the types of collaboration when implementing various green practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Contingency; Environmental management; Green practices; Green supply chain collaboration; Stakeholder collaboration","Economics; Natural resources management; Waste management; Cost benefits; Green product design; Green production; Hong-kong; Performance effect; Performance outcome; United kingdom; Product design; environmental economics; environmental management; performance assessment; recycling; stakeholder; supply chain management; article; cost benefit analysis; environmental management; Hong Kong; product design; United Kingdom; China; Hong Kong; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098651294

Retailers often use promotions to boost the sales of the different items by leveraging the cross-item effects. We formulate the promotion optimization problem for multiple items as a nonlinear integer program. Our formulation includes several business rules as constraints. Our demand models can be estimated from data and capture the postpromotion dip effect and cross-item effects (substitution and complementarity). Because demand functions are typically nonlinear, the exact formulation is intractable. To address this issue, we propose a general class of integer programming approximations. For demand models with additive cross-item effects, we prove that it is sufficient to account for unilateral and pairwise contributions and derive parametric bounds on the performance of the approximation. We also show that the unconstrained problem can be solved efficiently via a linear program when items are substitutable and the price set has two values. For more general cases, we develop efficient rounding schemes to obtain an integer solution. We conclude by testing our method on realistic instances and convey the potential practical impact for retailers. © 2020 INFORMS","Dynamic pricing; Integer optimization; Promotions; Retail analytics","Functions; Linear programming; Retail stores; Sales; Cross-item effects; Demand function; Integer solutions; Nonlinear integer program; Optimization problems; Price promotions; Rounding schemes; Unconstrained problems; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097742686

In addition, we estimate a time-varying parameter factor-augmented vector autoregressive (TVP-FAVAR) model, which includes, in addition to the FCI, two observed macroeconomic variables. The results show the ability of the estimated FCI to predict risks in the financial market emanating from both the domestic market and the global market. Furthermore, the TVP-FAVAR model outperforms the constant-loading factor-augmented vector autoregressive model and the traditional vector autoregressive model in the out-of-sample forecasting of the inflation rate and the real gross domestic product growth rate. Finally, tighter financial conditions contract the real economy and are deflationary at the same time.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 251 senior managers or owners of PSF SMEs who were from an emerging market economy but had operations in various foreign markets. The two-step structural equation modeling procedure was used to analyze the data and investigate the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The results show the positive impacts of the PSF SME’s human capital on innovativeness, service capabilities and relationship value. Human capital also had indirect positive impacts on relationship value and financial performance. Service capabilities were found to have a positive impact on relationship value and financial performance. In addition, innovativeness was found to have a positive impact on financial performance. Practical implications: Emerging market PSF SMEs can gain competitive advantages and build solid long-term relationships with clients in the global marketplace when they focus on strengthening their human capital resources and successfully leveraging their innovativeness and service capabilities.

This is seen as a core strategy to obtain desired environmental impact like waste reduction and resource conservation. Beyond that, repair services also affect societal and economic aspects like the number of local jobs. To realize the potential, supply with as well as demand for repair services has to be ensured. In this study we report on how the city of Graz, Austria deals with challenges related to this by introducing a public funding scheme for repair services to increase demand, and funding and organizing a repair network to strengthen the suppliers. By means of a case study, we explore success factors and critical aspects related to setting up a repair network, and provide insights into the interplay of a financial incentive scheme for promoting repair. Key findings show that: (1) having the local government as the network organizer facilitates the integration of multiple sectors but might jeopardize the network's sustainability due to political reasons; (2) the interplay between public funding and the repair network is effective, but network heterogeneity induces risk; (3) cooperation within the network can improve price and service quality and thus, affect customer demand, but lacking awareness of repair in general and the repair network constrains demand. These insights and the related discussion result in the identification of future research opportunities and related questions. © 2020 The Author(s)","Circular economy; Funding scheme; Repair; Repair network","Conservation; Environmental impact; Finance; Service industry; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Customer demands; Economic aspects; Financial incentives; Local government; Network heterogeneity; Research opportunities; Resource conservation; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098853264

At each step, customers derive an uncertain value, which depends on a functional benefit and a subjective experience. The latter may depend on experiences realized at previous steps. Service designs determine the provider effort at each step given that customers prefer less-variable experiences, and enable a holistic perspective of the overall experience. We quantify two factors that shape service designs: the type of steps ((i) routine steps, where effort increases the functional benefit and decreases the experience variability, and (ii) nonroutine steps, where effort increases the functional benefit at the expense of higher variability) and a holistic coupling factor (at each step, the design is determined not only by experience realizations at predecessor steps but also by how it can shape subsequent experiences). The optimal efforts depend on the combination of these two factors, giving rise to actionable design rules. For a positive coupling factor, step type homogeneity leads to “spread the effort” designs (complementary efforts), whereas a negative coupling factor suggests focusing the effort on a few key steps at the expense of the rest of the service (substitutable efforts). Step type heterogeneity reverses these recommendations. Moreover, when the customer experience unfolds according to a nonstationary process with serial correlation, the effort at each step is determined by an impact zone defined by the steps surrounding the focal service step. Stronger correlation always induces higher effort, whereas weaker correlation may induce less effort in services with heterogeneous step types.

Food availability entails how close one is located to the nearest food location. These locations could be healthy and fresh food as applied explicitly to the study food deserts, generally considered to be low-income areas that are far from healthy and fresh food. In the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) network model where travel times and distances are either calculated along a line network such as a series of roads or via more traditional techniques such as Manhattan or Euclidean distance, healthy and fresh food locations are defined as destinations. The places people are traveling from are referred to as sources. However, modeling source locations can be increasingly complex. In just measuring food availability between all residential parcels to the closest healthy food destination in Guilford County, North Carolina, it requires more than 177,000 route calculations, one for each of the residential parcels in Guilford County, North Carolina. Research (Zandbergen and Hart 2009; Fischer 2004; Sahar et al. 2019; Winn 2014) has highlighted the challenges in efficiently locating many addresses and calculating so many routes. In order to simplify the number of network calculations, this research explores ways to model, agglomerate or simplify source locations to decrease the sheer number of calculations while not degrading results when compared to calculations using all original 177,000 source locations. Studies in the field of food security have modeled source locations as census tract centroids, block group centroids, as well as random points and even fishnets or grids. In this paper, we explore the use of different techniques to simulate source locations in the study of food availability in Guilford County, North Carolina. These results are compared to calculations using all residential source locations in the county as a baseline. While all eleven techniques, which include random, stratified and systematic, as well as combinations of them, showed some level of agreement with baseline measurements, sources simulated as block centroids, population-weighted block group centroids and even a randomized-strata technique were strongest using t-tests of two means and equivalence tests for dissimilarity for both drive-distance and drive-time. © 2021 The Author(s)",,"food availability; food security; GIS; networking; numerical model; optimization; spatial analysis; Guilford County; North Carolina; United States; Rosa carolina carolina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102067132

The use of Data science tools enormously increased along with the advancement of data mining and artificial intelligence tools. Classification is a famous machine learning tool with vast potential use in the stock market. However, predicting stock price through a perfect classification model is vital as different stock market data have individual patterns and dependencies as precise information about increasing or decreasing the market can significantly influence selling or buying the shares. The linear model of classification including logistic regression classification (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial last-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), penalized discriminant analysis (PDA), and nearest Shrunken discriminant analysis are considered in this study to compare according to predict the stock market price of top six banks stock prices of Bangladesh. The existing literature recommends that PLS-DA fit well if data contain a high correlation among the predictors. On the contrary, PDA performs better if there is any multicollinearity problem or chance of overfitting; LDA gave better approximation when data got multivariate normality, and the nearest shrunken method fit well if there is any existence of high dimensionality.

Thus, this study recommends that one may choose LR among the linear classification model if there is a high correlation, multicollinearity, multivariate normality, and high-dimensionality among predictors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","LDA; Logistic regression classification; Machine learning; NS-DA; PDA; PLS-DA; Stock market price","Commerce; Data mining; Discriminant analysis; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Bangladesh; Classification models; Linear classification; Linear discriminant analyze; Logistic regression classification; Logistics regressions; NS-DA; Partial last-square discriminant analyse; Penalized discriminant analyse; Stock market prices; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098575888

This is accomplished by examining whether investors respond to mandatory periodic disclosures by coal mining firms as well as mine fatality incidents. Our results show that the market does not react to the safety incident disclosures. This is contrary to previous research that shows that markets react to safety disclosures made voluntarily by management, who presumably evaluate materiality prior to disclosure. Our results show mixed evidence on whether markets react negatively to mine fatality incidents. While we find limited evidence that markets react negatively to severe safety incidents with multiple fatalities, our work shows that for most cases with single fatalities, there is no evidence that markets react negatively. This work contributes to the discussion on appropriate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures by firms by examining the effectiveness of mandatory and voluntary disclosures. We recommend that future work examine whether markets react to more severe mine safety incidents and those in other industry sectors. Overall, this work shows that without adequate research to establish the optimal threshold for ESG disclosures, government's attempts to elicit mandatory disclosures are not likely to achieve the policy goals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abnormal returns; Mineral policy; Mining; Safety disclosures; Sustainability","Accident prevention; Coal mines; Commerce; Investments; Public policy; Coal mining; Industry sectors; Mine safety; Optimal threshold; Policy goals; Policy outcomes; Safety incidents; Coal industry; coal mining; market conditions; mine; policy making; safety; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094628777

This threatens to create conflict, as different social groups involved in blockchain development often disagree on which capabilities specific systems should enact. This article adopts a boundary object perspective to make sense of disagreements between collaborating social worlds. We perform a case study of privacy attitudes among collaborating actors in Monero, a cryptocurrency community that emphasises privacy and decentralisation alongside a set of values sometimes described as anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist, and/or cypherpunk. The case study performs a series of interviews with users, developers, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and government regulators. Three novel and important findings emerge. The first is that none of the social worlds express a desire to monitor routine transactions, despite the obvious business and tax-collection value of such data. The second is that regulators are happy to postpone active involvement, based on the flawed assumption they can impose privacy-related regulation later, once risks have become clear. Such regulation may not be possible as protocols and rulesets currently being coded into the system may be impossible to amend in the future (unless they can obtain either developer or network consensus). The third is that regulators assume methods for overseeing extraordinary transaction are necessary to avoid widespread, near-effortless money laundering. Yet, each of the other social worlds is operating under the assumption that this trade-off has already been accepted. These findings demonstrate subtle power transitions and changes in privacy attitudes that have implications for research on blockchain, management, and boundary objects in general. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2020.","Blockchain; boundary objects; cryptocurrency; Monero; privacy","Codes (symbols); Economic and social effects; Risk perception; Boundary objects; Decentralisation; Government regulators; Money laundering; OR-networks; Privacy attitudes; Social groups; Trade off; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089983871

The idea of the hydroponic farm is to allow individuals/businesses to grow plants. Given the geographical condition, the hydroponic system may be useful in the Gulf context and may lead to food security and sustainability. Additionally, the UAE government has initiated several support schemes that can be availed for investing in such businesses that can contribute to the nation's food security. Design/methodology/approach: The hydroponic farm is evaluated using the net present value and real options approach. The authors studied five scenarios: 1. business as usual, 2. 50% subsidy on initial investment through Khalifa funding, 3. 4% premium, 4. Subsidy plus premium and 5. solar panel installation with bore well. Findings: As per the assumptions and data usage, all the scenarios shows a positive net present value (NPV); Nevertheless, scenarios 4 and 5 report the significant highest net present and delay value. Research limitations/implications: This study has environmental, economic and social implications. Lower imports indirectly lead to lower carbon footprints. The local production of food ensures higher employability in the sector and increase in local consumption. Additionally, fresh food consumption is directly associated to good health. Practical implications: Supportive policies such as subsidies through Khalifa funding may accelerate the expansion of such projects through domestic and foreign investments. One of the important takeaway from the study is to invest in the training of the workforce. Social implications: Given the geographical condition, the UAE usually depends on food imports. If the hydroponic farms become popular, the residents will have access to fresh vegetables and fruits. Higher engagement in agriculture activities also ensures a significant increase in agriculture-related businesses and higher employability. Originality/value: The study adds novelty to the literature because the effect of Khalifa funding and investment analysis on solar (wells) has not been evaluated in any hydroponic studies. We presented the results with tornado graphs using NPV risk and real options approach in the Gulf context. The study represents functional scenarios that were previously not found in the literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Arabian Gulf; Business risk; Food economics; Hydroponics; International markets; Net present value; Real options approach","adult; agricultural land; article; carbon footprint; desert; economics; employability; food security; fruit; funding; geography; government; human; hydroponics; investment; nutrient; Persian Gulf; resident; sustainable agriculture; uncertainty; United Arab Emirates; vegetable; whole food; workforce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098275961

We focus on two key components of information contained in the message—information about the sender’s purchase status prior to referral and information about the existence of referral rewards—and their impacts on the recipient’s purchase decision and further referral behavior. In collaboration with an online daily-deal platform, we design and conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment involving more than 75,000 customers to identify the causal effect of different message designs on creating social contagion. We find that small variations in message content can have a significant impact on both recipients’ purchase and referral behaviors. Specifically, we find that (1) adding only information about the sender’s purchase status increases the likelihood of the recipient’s purchase but has no impact on follow-up referrals, (2) adding only information about referral reward increases the recipient’s follow-up referrals but has no impact on purchase likelihood, and (3) adding information about both the sender’s purchase and the referral rewards increases neither the likelihood of purchase nor follow-up referrals. We build a model to analyze the tradeoff between more adoption and more diffusion and implement the best-performing message design in a production system with millions of shared messages per year (with a projected increase in net profits of more than US$1 million per year). We further exploit the rich heterogeneity in deal, recipient, sender, and social-tie characteristics and examine the mechanisms underlying the effect of message design. The results suggest that both social learning and social utility are at work, and the attenuation in the recipient’s purchase is mainly driven by a decrease in social learning resulting from credibility concerns. The findings of the study provide actionable guidelines to firms for optimal design of messages at the aggregate and more granular levels. © 2020 INFORMS.","Observational learning; Online word of mouth; Randomized field experiment; Referrals; Social contagion","Aggregates; Field experiment; Granular levels; Optimal design; Production system; Purchase decision; Small variations; Social learning; Social utility; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101041110

However, freight destination behavior at a high resolution has received scant attention. In our study, we attempt to address the limited research on destination decision processes and develop a latent segmentation-based approach that accommodates mode and destination choices in a unified framework. The proposed approach postulates that these two choices are actually sequential in nature with an infinitesimally small time gap between them. However, the actual sequence (mode-destination or destination-mode) is unknown to us. Thus, a probabilistic model that can accommodate for the two choice sequences within a single framework is proposed. The latent segmentation framework probabilistically assigns the decision maker to the two sequences. In the Mode first – Destination second (MD) sequence, the destination choice model is calibrated with choice alternatives customized to the chosen mode. In the Destination first – Mode second (DM) sequence, the destination model is calibrated without any mode information as mode is unknown to the decision maker. In the study, we used 2012 US Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data. We found that the latent segmentation-based sequence model outperformed the independent sequence models (MD and DM). The validation exercise also confirmed the superiority of the proposed framework. Finally, an elasticity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Destination choice; Freight; Latent class model; Mode choice; Sequence model","decision making; freight transport; model validation; research work; transportation development; transportation planning; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098987919

The current study examines two choice dimensions for capturing the system level bikeshare system demand: (1) total station level demand and (2) distribution of bike flows from an origin station across the network. A linear mixed model is used to estimate the first choice and Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model is used to analyze the latter. The data is drawn from the New York City bikeshare system (CitiBike) for six months (January through June 2017). For our analysis, we examine demand and distribution patterns on a weekly basis controlling for a host of independent variables (trip, socio-demographics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and built environment, temporal and weather). Model validation exercise results revealed that the proposed model performs well for low demand destinations. A policy exercise evaluating destination choice behavior demonstrated how the impact of distance is compensated by additional bicycling infrastructure in the farther locations.

The government of Turkey also has been advancing this type of analysis in the practical management of forests. The creation of ecosystem services (ES) suitability map for forests through a participatory approach can provide forest managers valuable information that informs ecosystem-based management plans. The objective of this paper is to formulate and solve the problem of assigning management actions to forest stands in order to optimally provide ecosystem services that are consistent with, and based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). We outline a model for a participatory process that has seven steps: (1) determine the possible ES that can be supported on the landscape, (2) create a suitability map for each management unit (stand of trees), (3) define SDG for each ES, (4) create the stakeholder groups, (5) determine the importance of each SDG, (6) determine the contribution of ES to each SDG, and (7) assign ES to each management unit in an optimal manner. We used pairwise comparisons and the Delphi method to determine stakeholder preferences. This information guided the assignment of management actions to management units when optimizing ES outcomes. This approach was applied to a case study centered on the Belgrad Forest, located in northwest Turkey. The percent of land assigned to ES was respectively, water regulation (71%), cultural heritage (17%), education (9%), water supply (2%), and carbon (1%). Through this process, for this case study area, there were no assignments for recreation and aesthetic quality services. As a result, the Belgrade Forest was zoned into management classes unlike the current situation. The pairwise comparisons and the Delphi method can help formalize public participation in the decision-making process. Results from these can inform a resource allocation optimization model through the development of coefficients and constraints. © 2020 The Authors","Assignment problem; Decision making; Delphi method; Ecosystem services; Mixed integer programming","Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Water supply; Decision making process; Ecosystem-based management; Forest management units; Pair-wise comparison; Participatory approach; Participatory process; Public participation; Resource allocation optimization; Decision making; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095822167

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, which demonstrates how both the product and the supply chain can simultaneously be designed based on real-time data. At the heart of the proposed model is the utilisation of a cloud-based management system comprising of three steps. In the first step, a generic bill of materials is modelled to design a set of product families using “AND” and “OR” nodes. In the second step, a cloud-based framework is designed to manage real-time costs viz. echelons. In the third step, a mixed integer linear programming model is then applied, which optimizes the SCD based on real-time costs. We use a metaheuristic method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the optimization problem. We further illustrate the model using power transformer numerical example. Then the critical parameters of GA are examined to determine the best settings. We believe that the proposed SCD is an intelligent and expert management system, which can facilitate effective decision-making support by taking into account real-time cost data.

Our theory explains why CEOs with uncommon names tend to develop a conception of being different from peers and accordingly pursue strategies that deviate from industry norms. We further suggest that the positive relationship between CEO name uncommonness and strategic distinctiveness is strengthened by the CEO's confidence, power, and environmental munificence. Using name commonness data from the U.S. Social Security Administration and financial data of 1,172 public firms over a 19-year period, we find support for our theoretical predictions. Managerial summary: Using 19 years of data on 1,172 public firms, we show that firms' distinctive strategies are systematically linked to their CEOs' uncommon names. Psychological studies suggest that individuals with uncommon names tend to have a self-conception of being different from their peers. Although many people may not have the confidence to exhibit how unique they believe themselves to be, CEOs do—they are generally confident individuals. It is thus predicted that CEOs with more uncommon names tend to pursue strategies that deviate more from their peer firms'. This pattern is even clearer when CEOs have a higher level of confidence, possess greater power, and operate businesses in an environment with more growth opportunities.

Firstly, we propose a methodology to identify the region of risk-expected return space where ex-post performance matches ex-ante estimates. Secondly, we extend ex-post efficient set mathematics to overcome the biases in the estimation of the ex-ante efficient frontier. A density forecasting approach is used to measure the accuracy of ex-ante estimates using the Berkowitz statistic, we develop this statistic to increase its sensitivity to changes in the data generating process. The area of risk-expected return space where the density forecasts are accurate, where ex-post performance matches ex-ante estimates, is termed the consistency region. Under the 'laboratory' conditions of a simulated multivariate normal data set, we compute the consistency region and the estimated ex-post frontier. Over different sample sizes used for estimation, the behaviour of the consistency region is shown to be both intuitively reasonable and to enclose the estimated ex-post frontier. Using actual data from the constituents of the US Dow Jones 30 index, we show that the size of the consistency region is time dependent and, in volatile conditions, may disappear. Using our development of the Berkowitz statistic, we demonstrate the superior performance of an investment strategy based on consistent rather than efficient portfolios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Estimation errors; Mean-variance optimisation; Portfolio optimisation; Portfolio selection","Financial markets; Forecasting; Planning; Density forecast; Density forecasting; Efficient frontier; Efficient portfolio; Investment strategy; Multivariate normal; Performance match; Portfolio selection; Estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087929829

The country’s leaders have long attempted to balance the allocation of resources between a strong military and a developing economy in their quest for stability, peace and prosperity. This paper examines and sheds further light on the relationship between Jordan’s military expenditure and its economic growth during the period 1970–2015. Using the Gregory -Hansen cointegration technique allowing for structural breaks, and the ARDL methodology this paper tests the short–and long–run equilibrium relationship between military expenditure and economic growth in Jordan. Furthermore, with the error correction model (ECM) and the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests, we examine the stability of the above relationship. The results reveal positive short–and long–run relationships between military expenditure and economic growth in Jordan, during the period under study. This finding has important policy implications for the Jordanian state, as it justifies the transfer of resources to the military, showing that it has not had a negative impact on economic growth. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ARDL; cointegration; economic growth; Jordan; military spending",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121404340

Yet, the existing understanding of digital content consumption is focused primarily on consumption of free content. This means, that digital content is not a source of revenue for contributors and not directly tied to the revenue or expenses of these platforms and that it is practically impossible to capture its value in national income accounts. Academic and anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that sharing of revenue from paid viewership in paid question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms is a factor that differentiates successful platforms, such as Weibo Q&A, from unsuccessful ones, such as Google Answers. Yet, the growing paid Q&A literature does not shed much light on our understanding of the drivers of revenues from paid viewership. Our study focuses on the unique revenue sharing of paid viewership among stakeholders because this feature makes paid Q&A a success and helps ensure the sustainability of the hosting social media platform. This study draws upon signaling theory to identify the drivers of the sales of paid viewership. We further draw on the cognitive view of signal attention and interpretation and the literature on social media trend and the literature on information perishability to hypothesize the differential moderating impacts of question price and content perishability. Consistent with the literature, we found the positive impacts of social media status and social endorsement on the sales of paid viewership. Extending past literature, we found an inverted-U impact of social feedback and the differential moderating effects of question price and content perishability on the sales of paid viewership. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Content monetization; content perishability; paid Q&A; sales of paid viewership","Sales; Social networking (online); Anecdotal evidences; Digital contents; Moderating effect; Revenue-sharing; Signaling theory; Social feedbacks; Social media; Social media platforms; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112634389

The uncertainty originates from others' decisions and their consequences, and cannot be meaningfully reduced to risk. The authors postulate that, in order to cope with this type of uncertainty, bankers use simple rules, also called heuristics. This study aims to identify such heuristics and the psychological processes that underlie them. Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 22 managers of teams tasked to anticipate prices, in two leading investment and central banks. The primary data came from in-depth, semi-structured interviews lasting 30–60 min, supplemented by our observations during the on-site visits, emails and phone calls when preparing the interviews, and reports published by the banks. Data were coded and heuristics were induced over multiple rounds by multiple researchers. Findings: Bankers (1) construct simple game representations of markets, (2) make inferences to gauge opponents, (3) become alert when they see too much agreement and (4) communicate coherent narratives. Heuristics (1)–(3) are employed when the pace of decision-making is fast, whereas (4) is used for longer time scales. In sum, bankers exhibit reciprocal bounded rationality, wherein interaction partners are mutually aware of and adapted to the fundamental uncertainty of the task and their limited resources. Originality/value: Heuristics for anticipating prices have not been studied empirically outside the lab. The findings may help integrate conceptualizations of heuristics in the simple-rules and fast-and-frugal-heuristics research programs and improve market efficiency. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Cognition; Decision making; Heuristics; Interviews; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108972831

This study examines the influence of hard apple cider attributes and consumer characteristics on consumer preferences for local hard apple cider. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a 2019 survey of 875 Tennessee consumers regarding their preferences for a local hard apple cider were obtained. Probit estimates were used to calculate the premium consumers were willing to pay for a locally made hard apple cider and factors influencing this premium. A multivariate probit was used to ascertain factors influencing the importance of attributes (e.g. heirloom apples, sweetness/dryness, sparking/still and no preservatives added) on local hard apple cider preference. Findings: Consumers would pay a $3.22 premium for local hard apple cider compared with a $6.99 reference product. Local foods preferences, urbanization, weekly purchases of other alcoholic beverages and shopping venues influenced premium amounts. Other important attributes were sweetness/dryness and no preservatives. Influence of consumer demographics suggests targeted marketing of local ciders could be successful.

Thus, this study aims to examine the role of CW in predicting heritage tourists’ behavioural intention by employing two seminal behaviour models, the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB). The data were collected from 323 heritage travellers who visited Hanok Village in South Korea, where approximately 735 Hanoks (traditional Korean house) were preserved as a popular tourist attraction. The study’s findings demonstrate that tourists’ CW can be an important variable in the prediction and understanding of behavioural intention among heritage tourists and may serve as a proxy for perceived behavioural control. This study also identified that subjective norm was the strongest predictor of behavioural intention among heritage travellers. The overall results support that a positive attitude towards visiting a heritage village, which features Hanoks, strong normative support in their visit intention, and strong CW was positively associated with the behavioural intention of the heritage travellers. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed to enhance the heritage visitors’ attitude, perception, and behavioural intention. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behavioural intention; Cultural worldview; Hanok Village; heritage tourist; theory of planned behaviour; theory of reasoned action","cultural relations; heritage tourism; numerical model; theoretical study; tourist attraction; tourist behavior; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103554454

The authors are interested in critically investigating if this statement is still valid nowadays. It involves the analysis of the usage of the seven QC tools in the manufacturing and service sectors and the benefits, challenges and critical success factors (CSFs) for the application of the seven QC tools. Design/methodology/approach: In order to evaluate Kaoru Ishikawa's statement and how valid his statement is for manufacturing and service industries nowadays, an online survey instrument was developed, and data collection was performed utilising a stratified random sampling strategy. The main strata/clusters were formed by senior quality professionals working in operational excellence, quality consultants, quality directors, quality engineers, quality managers and quality supervisors working in both manufacturing and service sectors from South American companies. A total of 97 participants from different countries in South America responded to the survey. Findings: The main finding of this study is that only about 20% of respondents felt that the original seven basic tools of QC can solve above 80% of quality related problems in their businesses. This is quite different from the findings reported by Dr Ishikawa in his work in between 1970 and 1980s. Another relevant finding presented in this paper is that Pareto analysis, histograms and cause and effect analysis are the most used tools in both manufacturing and service sectors. This paper also revealed that the seven QC tools proposed by Dr. Ishikawa were least used by human resources (HR), information technology (IT) and finance functions. This work presents a list of critical success factors required for the proper application of the seven QC tools. Research limitations/implications: All data collected in the pilot survey came from professionals working for South American companies. So, this paper does present limitations in terms of generalisation of the results. Also, data were collected at an individual level, so parameters such as the inter reliability of judgements on a particular survey item could not be evaluated. It is important to highlight that n = 97 is a low sample size, enough for a preliminary survey but reinforcing the limitation in terms of generalisation of the results. Originality/value: Authors understand that this is the very first research focused on challenging Dr. Ishikawa's statement: “95% of problems in processes can be accomplished using the seven quality control (QC) tools” from his book “What is Quality Control?”.

In this paper, we establish a multi-step procedure for using HMM to select stocks from the global stock market. First, the five important factors of a stock are identified and scored based on its historical performances. Second, HMM is used to predict the regimes of six global economic indicators and find the time periods in the past during which these indicators have a combination of regimes that is similar to those predicted. Then, we analyze the five stock factors of the All country world index (ACWI) in the identified time periods to assign a weighted score for each stock factor and to calculate the composite score of the five factors. Finally, we make a monthly selection of 10% of the global stocks that have the highest composite scores.

The study uses longitudinal data on about 5,000 startups and presents evidence that entrepreneurial learning happens rapidly in the initial years of setting up a business, before settling down to a steady-state phase. The data show that entrepreneurs assign a higher weight, around 30%, to market signals in early years and with time this weight declines to about 16% in the sixth year, when prior information gains more bearing in decision-making. Specifically, the study substantiates the claim of existing theories and argues that over time, entrepreneurs learn to maintain the delicate balance between prior learning and new information from the market. Furthermore, results also indicate the presence of learning heterogeneity across entrepreneurs, possibly explaining the need for diversity in assistance programmes to meet the requirements of startups. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian analysis; C11; D83; entrepreneurship; information and knowledge; L26; Learning; M13; startups","Bayesian analysis; decision making; entrepreneur; knowledge; learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097820551

It postulates a framework, where abnormal returns are generated by a process which features two autoregressive components, one stock-specific and one related to network effects. This process deviates from customary ones in that the parameters are specific to each stock/firm, that the autoregressive process is explicitly modelled instead of using cumulative abnormal returns over a pre-specified window, and that network effects are present. Abandoning either one of those deviations is rejected by data on Chinese stocks in 2018 and 2019, an episode which is significant for an abnormal stock-market returns analysis, as it was characterized by numerous tariff-setting events related to the “trade war” between the USA and China. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cumulative abnormal returns; Listed firms; Panel models; Spatial and network models; Spillovers","capital flow; capital market; econometrics; numerical model; regression analysis; stock market; tariff structure; China; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097135400

Within the overall conceptual focus of peace engineering, we analyze the operations and activities of six Turkish firms operating in the violence-hit and fragile countries of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Morocco (the Western Sahara region), Somalia, and Sudan. The findings indicate that foreign firms operating in fragile and conflict-affected countries, along with achieving business goals, contribute significantly to the skills development of local employees and establish legitimacy through forging social connections and adopting corporate social responsibility activities. Their support for skills development resulted in career advancement opportunities and, in some cases, entrepreneurial ventures that were initiated by local employees. We argue that, despite precarious and unpredictable conditions, the operations of such firms can provide economic incentives as well as increased well-being and long-term stability in such contexts.

Compared with consumers who had used Yelp before, those who had never used the site expect their browsing duration and review counts to be 42% and 93% higher, respectively. In addition, before making a decision, most consumers spend only five minutes or less, read five or fewer reviews, and browse seven to eight pages.

Market offerings that deviate from category norms risk devaluation. Although literature in this area has led to valuable insights, scholars have begun to question whether there has been an overemphasis on conformity, leaving existing theories ill-equipped to account for innovation. Within this context, we argue that research on authenticity in cultural sociology offers a useful platform for theorizing. We draw on the work of Peterson (1997), who underscores the importance of signals in evaluation. Objective features of market offerings (e.g., quality) matter, but particularly for innovations, these features are not readily visible. Because authentic producers are typically thought to be more committed, capable, and intrinsically motivated, when visibility of such objective features is lacking, authenticity may serve as an alternative indicator of value. Appearing authentic requires signaling believability with respect to category norms, while also being distinctive. Using data on 684 firms from five high technology sectors, we explore the relationship between authenticity and investor perceptions of value. Focusing on three different proxies for signals of authenticity—networks, governance, and narratives—we find a curvilinear association between conformity/distinctiveness and Tobin's q. Consistent with our view of authenticity as a signal, we also find that this relationship flattens as firms gain better track records and face stiffer competition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Authenticity; Categories; High-Technology; Innovation; Market Value; Natural Language Processing; Networks; Text Analysis","Commerce; Competition; Investments; Sociology; High technology; High technology industries; Peterson; Track record; Authentication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089421576

To respond to these timely issues, this study adopts a behavioral perspective and comparatively explores how four different types of digital machines—characterized by increasing degrees of manufacturing flexibility—affect the perception and use of space and time for routines within the production plant. To this end, 45 digital manufacturing machines, sampled across 14 firms in the British and Italian motorsport industry, were qualitatively observed and compared. A model emerges where four key mechanisms reshape (1) the interactive space around the machine, (2) the innovation activities performed in the machine space, (3) the time within activities involving the machine, and (4) the time perception. Such mechanisms mediate the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and firm performance. Further, data show how increasing digitalization in the manufacturing process enhances the establishment of new routines as flexible machines get introduced in the production. Finally, theoretical and practical implications related to fostering a behavioral perspective in innovation and operations management studies are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

The EBA addresses model uncertainty in identifying robust determinant(s) of cross-sectional return predictability. Additionally, the paper develops two profitable trading strategies based on return predictability evidence. The result reveals that among the 13 determinants of the cross-sectional variation of return predictability, only value of stock traded (a measure of liquidity) is found to have robust explanatory power by Leamer's (1985) EBA. However, Sala-i-Martin's (1997) EBA reports that value of stock traded, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, level of information and communication technology (ICT) development, governance quality, and corruption perception are robust determinants. We further find that a strategy of buying (selling) aggregate market portfolios of the countries with the highest positive (negative) return predictability statistic in the past 24 months generates statistically significant positive returns in the subsequent 3 to 12 months. In the individual country level, a trading rule of buying (selling) the respective country's aggregate market portfolio, when the return predictability statistic turns out positive (negative), outperforms the conventional buy-and-hold strategy for many countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Extreme bounds analysis; Fifty equity markets; Return predictability; Trading strategies","Aggregates; Profitability; Uncertainty analysis; Aggregate market; Buy-and-hold strategy; Explanatory power; Gross domestic products; Information and Communication Technologies; Market variations; Model uncertainties; Trading strategies; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087732806

The tourism literature, however, has yet to critique this practice due to the commonly held belief that reverse polarity items reduce acquiescence bias. With a limited critique of its practice within the tourism literature, the purpose of this ‘Methods and Practice’ paper is to provide a literature review of the topic and to conduct psychometric analyses on four tourism scales including reversed polarity items. EFA and CFA results from 703 responses to the Psychological, Social, and Political Empowerment Scales of the Resident Empowerment through Tourism Scale and 300 responses to the Perceived Stress Scale reveal that the inclusion of reversed polarity items had significant negative impacts on unidimensionality, model fit, factor loadings, and AVE in each instance. Differences were also found in the strength of regression coefficients and variance explained between reverse and non-reverse polarity scales when regressed on theoretically relevant dependent variables. Implications for future scale development are discussed highlighting the need to simultaneously reduce acquiescence bias and ensure scales demonstrate construct validity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acquiescence bias; confirmatory factory analysis; exploratory factor analysis; negatively worded items; reversed polarity items; Scale development","education; empowerment; literature review; numerical model; regression analysis; tourism; variance analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087034580

Because most demand forecasts incorporate human judgment, they are subject to both unintentional error and intentional opportunistic bias. We examine whether a disaggregation of the forecast into various sources of demand reduces forecast error and bias. Using proprietary data from a manufacturing organization, we find that absolute demand forecast error declines following the implementation of a disaggregated forecast system. We also find a favorable effect of forecast disaggregation on finished goods inventory without a corresponding increase in costly production plan changes. We further document a decline in positive forecast bias, except for products whose production is limited owing to scarce production resources.

For a city’s traffic management team, traffic congestion challenges economic growth and increases pollution. Many drivers rely on a GPS navigation system to choose the fastest route to reach their destination. The GPS algorithms generally work for a single driver, while ignoring their collective resulting impact on the road network. If there exists a cooperative centralised routing algorithm that minimises the whole network congestion, the city can greatly benefit from congestion reduction, though some drivers may suffer from such a cooperative routing algorithm. These drivers may opt-out from the cooperative centralised routing, which, in turn, impacts the whole network routing efficiency. So, does having higher proportions of cooperative drivers on the road network always work better? In this paper, we take a heuristic cooperative routing algorithm which minimises the network congestion. We simulate a road network and measure its performance under various proportions of cooperative drivers. We measure both the congestion and the average drivers’ perceived road network performance. Network data envelopment analysis (network DEA) technique is used to see which proportions of cooperative drivers can best benefit the city and drivers collectively. © Operational Research Society 2020.","cooperative navigation; network DEA; performance evaluation; Traffic congestion","Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Energy utilization; Global positioning system; Human resource management; Motor transportation; Network routing; Roads and streets; Congestion reduction; Cooperative navigations; Cooperative routing algorithms; Network congestions; Network DEA; performance evaluation; Routing efficiency; Traffic management; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079225606

The majority of existing ETS are early-stage systems implemented in and after 2013. These early-stage ETS are typically characterised by a focus on few industry sectors, and the employment of free emission allocation schemes including grandfathering and benchmarking. In this paper, we investigate the impact of emission allocation schemes in an early-stage cap-and-trade system in a duopoly market. We show that benchmarking scheme may lead the energy-efficient firm to reserve part of its emission permits, while firms always use up their after-trading permits under grandfathering. We also find that a more stringent emission cap may increase firms' profits rather than decreasing them under both allocation schemes, suggesting a possible cause for windfall profits observed in early-stage ETS. Benchmarking is found to lead to lower emissions compared to those under grandfathering, while it may result in higher or lower firm profits, consumer surplus, and the overall social welfare. Furthermore, under either allocation scheme, allowing emission trading does not affect the total emissions, while it can increase firm profits and consumer surplus and therefore the overall social welfare. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","benchmarking; Cap-and-trade; duopoly; emission permit allocation; grandfathering","Benchmarking; Competition; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Profitability; Cap and trade; duopoly; Economic incentive; Emission permits; Emission trading; Emission trading systems; grandfathering; Industry sectors; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078047924

We empirically test the models using a sample of U.S. public firms for a period of 2012–2016.

This paper models how firms compete by managing their online reputations. We consider a market consisting of competing firms that participate in a platform such as Expedia or Yelp. Each firm exerts effort to improve its rating but, in doing so, also influences the mean market rating. The sales of a firm are influenced by its own rating and the mean rating of the firms in the market. We formulate each firm’s decision as a stochastic control problem in which the objective is to maximize the discounted profit over a planning horizon. These control problems are connected through a common market belief that represents the mean rating of the firms in the market. The joint actions of the firms generate a mean market rating in equilibrium. We prove that such an equilibrium exists and is unique, and we use a simple algorithm to compute its value. An equilibrium analysis of the mean market rating reveals several insights. A more heterogeneous market (one in which the parameters of the firms are very different) leads to a lower mean market rating and higher total profit of the firms in the market. Our results can inform platforms to target certain firms to join: growing the middle of the market (firms with average ratings) is the best option considering the goals of the platform (increase the total profit of the firms) and other stakeholders, namely the incumbents and the consumers. For firms, we find that a firm’s profit can increase from an adverse event (such as a reduction in sales margin or an increase in the cost of control) depending on how other firms in the market are affected by the event. Our findings are particularly significant for platform owners to employ a strategic growth model for the platform. © 2021 INFORMS","competition; controlled diffusion process; equilibrium; online reputation","Commerce; Profitability; Sales; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Control problems; Controled diffusion process; Controlled diffusion; Diffusion process; Digital economy; Equilibrium; Marketing mix; Mean ratings; Online reputation; Total profits; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134688141

This result confirms that the changes in enforcement induced by the ruling reduced some of the distortions caused by patent litigation.

The FDA uses postmarket surveillance systems to monitor drugs already on the market; a drug found to be associated with an increased risk of adverse events (ADEs) is subject to a recall or a warning. A flawed postmarket decision-making process can have unintended consequences for patients, create uncertainty among providers and affect their prescribing practices, and subject the FDA to unfavorable public scrutiny. The FDA's current pharmacovigilance process suffers from several shortcomings (e.g., a high underreporting rate), often resulting in incorrect or untimely decisions. Thus, there is a need for robust, data-driven approaches to support and enhance regulatory decision making in the context of postmarket pharmacovigilance. We propose such an approach that has several appealing features-it employs large, reliable, and relevant longitudinal databases; it uses methods firmly established in literature; and it addresses selection bias and endogeneity concerns. Our approach can be used to both (i) independently validate existing safety concerns relating to a drug, such as those emanating from existing surveillance systems, and (ii) perform a holistic safety assessment by evaluating a drug's association with other ADEs to which the users may be susceptible.We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it retrospectively to a highly publicized FDA black box warning (BBW) for rosiglitazone, a diabetes drug. Using comprehensive data from the Veterans Health Administration on more than 320,000 diabetes patients over an eightyear period, we find that the drug was not associated with the two ADEs that led to the BBW, a conclusion that the FDA evidently reached, as it retracted the warning six years after issuing it. We demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by retroactively evaluating two additional warnings, those related to statins and atenolol, which we found to be valid. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

To mitigate climate-induced production losses, various stress-tolerant varieties have been developed and adopted in many countries around the globe. We assess the impacts of adopting submergence-tolerant (Sub1) rice varieties on productivity, profit, and rice consumption in northwest Bangladesh, using Endogenous Switching Regression and cross-sectional data in 2016. The findings reveal that the adoption of Sub1 rice had a significant positive impact on yield (6.0% higher), profit (55.0% higher), and rice consumption (15.0% higher) vis-à-vis the impact on non-adopters. Importantly, non-adopters could benefit if they adopted Sub1 rice—with about 8%, 48%, and 15% more rice yield, profit, and rice consumption, respectively. The findings further reveal that approximately 42% of the sampled farmers adopted Sub1 rice in northwest Bangladesh. The main drivers of this adoption are access to information on Sub1 rice through neighbors, farmer organizations, and training. Also, the application of pesticides and irrigation negatively affected the adoption of Sub1 rice. Finally, we find that rice production, profit, and rice consumption are location dependent. Therefore, we suggest implementing location-specific policies and developing social and institutional capacity to build trust in the new technology, which will increase the dissemination of Sub1 seeds by transferring agricultural knowledge and incentivizing farmers to adopt Sub1 rice in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Climate-resilient varieties; Impact assessment; Rice; Technology adoption","accessibility; adaptive management; climate change; farmers knowledge; flooding; food consumption; food policy; household structure; incentive; profitability; rice; technology adoption; tolerance; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118325044

By combining three databases: Orbis by Bureau van Dijk, FDIMarkets by Financial Times, and PATSTAT by The European Patent Office, we obtain a sample of more than 20,000 firms for the period 2008–2015. The MNE firms originate in 175 countries, which span the entire spectrum of economic development- from low to high-income countries. The industrial distribution of the firms covers 72 industries at the 2-digit ISIC level. We construct a model, which allows us to analyze the impact of OGFDI capital investment, as well as OGFDI-created employment, on the number of patents of the companies engaging in the GFDI. We control for various firm characteristics, such as performance measures and size of the corporate group. We also control for the country of origin of the firms, stratifying the sample into emerging market MNEs and developed countries MNEs. We use linear estimation techniques to analyze the relationship between the variables and test how the results change across industries with different patent intensities. We find that both capital investment and jobs created through OGFDI boost the innovation activity of MNEs, and these effects are bigger for industries with higher patent intensities, such as the production of chemicals, computers, and motor vehicles. For sectors that rely less on patents (oil and electricity sectors) the impact of GFDI on patenting activity is smaller and for the case of building constructions, we even find a negative impact of investments on innovation. We further find that the effects are larger for EMNEs than DMNEs and discuss appropriate policies. © 2021","Greenfield foreign direct investment; Innovation; Multinational enterprises; Patents","Investments; Capital investment; Foreign direct investments; Greenfield; Greenfield foreign direct investment; Innovation; Innovation activity; Internal generation; Multinational enterprise; Patent activity; Patent intensity; Patents and inventions; capital; foreign direct investment; innovation; multinational enterprise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115655602

However, how scaling occurs is scarcely understood. By building on the case studies of two healthcare social enterprises located in India, we make four important contributions to the understanding of the scaling up process. First, we demonstrate that entrepreneurial adjustments are guided by whether social firms prioritize alleviating their internal constraints or those faced by customers. Second, we show how such dynamic prioritization of constraints influences how firms mobilize resources and use operating routines from inception to market establishment. Third, we illustrate how, by pursuing resource mobilization strategies and operating routines, firms generate a ‘deep’ impact by expanding the number and type of their activities or a ‘broad’ one by increasing their membership base and/or geographic area.

In response, service providers offer “priority payment” which allows users to pay additional transaction fee in exchange for priority transaction processing. Despite its growing popularity, there is very limited formal research that studies this service and its impact. In this paper, we examine the impact of the priority option on SC members' blockchain payment service adoption behavior, payment service provider's strategies, as well as his revenue generation. We find that offering priority blockchain payment option increases heavy members' usage of the option and reduces their usage of the waiting blockchain payment option. On the other hand, it boosts certain light players' usage of both blockchain payment services when the transaction fee rate is not too high. The service provider should charge a lower (higher) transaction fee rate if the trust-enabling rate of the priority blockchain payment option is relatively high (low). Finally, we demonstrate that offering priority blockchain payment option actually reduces his revenue when the trust-enabling rate of the option is sufficiently low. Thus, blindly charging transaction fees actually does more harm than good to the service providers. © 2021","Blockchain; Game theory; Pricing strategy; Supply chain management","Costs; Economics; Game theory; Supply chain management; Adoption behavior; Block-chain; Chain management; Fee rates; Low-high; Payment services; Pricing strategy; Revenue generation; Service provider; Transaction processing; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114130965

However, significant barriers exist when sharing product design knowledge due to the lack of available formalized tools and methods. In this article, to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders during product design, a method to systematically improve the understanding of target objects, including the composition of the object, nature of the object, and tools to support its related communication, is proposed. Further, a knowledge representation framework is described which enables parties to clearly understand the characteristics of the object and greatly improve communication efficiency.

In this study, we focus on a firm's entire resource portfolio composition, and posit that bundling dissimilar types of resources is a complex process that involves trade-offs. Drawing on complexity theory, we propose that firm success may be influenced by resource composition, as represented by relative intangibility—that is, a firm's share of intangible resources relative to the sum of both types of resources. Curvilinear hypotheses with environmental moderators are developed and tested using Computer-Assisted-Text-Analysis (CATA) methodology on a 5-year longitudinal sample of 2,245 S&P 500 firms. The results suggest that relative intangibility exhibits a U-shaped relationship with productivity, a key indicator of firm success. However, shape-flips are observed when environmental moderators are introduced, as the relationship becomes inverted U-shaped in less complex environments characterized by low instability and high munificence. © 2021","Complexity theory; Curvilinear relationships; Firm success; Relative intangibility; Resource composition; Tangible and intangible resources","Economic and social effects; Moderators; Complex environments; Complex Processes; Complexity theory; Computer assisted; Intangible resources; Key indicator; Resource composition; Resource portfolio; Computer aided analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109089302

One of the most critical challenges is forecasting the demands of resources for appropriate resource allocations based on data from multiple sources with different levels of reliability. This paper deals with the challenge of data fusion and processing in forecasting resource demands for emergency responses to patients with various disease types. After an earthquake, the data on injuries, damages, and medical demands are characterized as diversified, unorganized, distributed, dynamic, and chaotic. Therefore, how to collect, filter, fuse, and mine data is most critical to forecast and allocate resources, especially for some emergent sources such as drugs for injuries and illnesses in post-earthquakes. To determine general patterns of outbreak diseases and corresponding medical needs, multi-source data is fused and processed to determine a reliable and accurate spectrum of post-earthquake diseases. The entropy-based weighting technology is adopted to determine the reliability and accuracy of data; the fused data is further processed to estimate the numbers of injuries, classify disease types, and finally predict the demands of medical supplies over time. In emergency rescues, medical resources are allocated and dispatched based on estimated numbers, types, and locations of patients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified and validated in simulation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Data fusion; Demand forecasting; Disease spectrum; Emergency response systems (EPS); Entropy-based weighting; Industry 4.0; Natural disasters","Data fusion; Data handling; Disasters; Earthquakes; Critical challenges; Emergency rescue; Emergency response; General patterns; Multiple source; Multisource data; Natural disasters; Resource demands; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108448333

Data thefts cause a loss of trust by the customer, but previous research has failed to identify how such events change customer perceptions and also influence future shopping behavior. Our survey of 390 individuals provides insight into how the individuality of the crime victims (targeting of a few named individuals or a large customer database) has strong effects. Specifically, respondents were more likely to blame the breached customers and less likely to blame the business if only a few individuals were targeted. Responses such as blaming the business and possessing a cynical perspective about the thieves and affected customers, along with the individuality of the crime, did have a significant effect on whether customers would choose to revisit the business. However, increased blame on affected customers did not necessarily lead to diminished revisits. We recommend that businesses respond to large database breaches with apologies and blame acceptance, and to small, targeted breaches with an agile mix of apology, blame acceptance, diminishment, and protest. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Customer relationship management; data theft; hacking; information technology and the internet; technology management","Personal computing; Public relations; Sales; Customer perceptions; Customer relationship management; Data thefts; E-commerce transactions; Empirical investigation; Number of datum; Shopping behavior; Technology managements; Crime",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081287414

The authors explore how social media influencers and traditional celebrities are using products within their own social media Instagram posts and how well their perceived endorsement of that product engages their network of followers. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 226,881 posts on Instagram were analyzed using the Inception V3 convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to identify product placement within the Instagram images of 75 of the world's most important social media influencers. The data were used to empirically test the relationships between influencers, product placement and network engagement and efficiency. Findings: Influencers achieved higher network engagement efficiencies than celebrities; however, celebrity reach was important for engagement overall. Specialty influencers, known for their “subject” expertise, achieved better network engagement efficiency for related product categories. The highest level of engagement efficiency was achieved by beauty influencers advocating and promoting cosmetic and beauty products. Practical implications: To maximize engagement and return on investment, manufacturers, retailers and brands must ensure a close fit between the product type and category of influencer promoting a product within their social media posts. Originality/value: Most research to date has focused on brand-controlled social media accounts. This study focused on traditional celebrities and social media influencers and product placement within their own Instagram posts to extend understanding of the perception of endorsement and subsequent engagement with followers. The authors extend the theory of network effects to reflect the complexity inherent in the context of social media influencers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Image analysis; Influencers; Object recognition; Product placement; Social media","Convolutional neural networks; Efficiency; Image analysis; Product design; Social networking (online); Beauty products; Design/methodology/approach; Higher networks; Network effects; Product placement; Product types; Related products; Social media; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114791176

The canonical example of this challenge is the landmark Illinois Brick ruling, which limits antitrust damages to only the direct purchasers of a product; for instance, consumers can file antitrust claims against colluding retailers but not against colluding manufacturers-only retailers can file claims against manufacturers. This controversial ruling was meant to reduce legal costs, but it can clearly lead to missed enforcement opportunities. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Illinois Brick ruling interacts with contracts adopted in the supply chain, and we show that otherwise equivalent supply chain arrangements can have markedly different effects. In particular, we find that wholesale price, minimum order quantity, revenue sharing, and quantity discount contracts lead retailers to take legal action against manufacturers in the event of collusive behavior. However, the wholesale price plus fixed fee contract structure (also known as a two-part tariff or slotting fee contract) facilitates collusion among the manufacturers with retailers compensated by the fixed fee and not filing the antitrust litigation. We further demonstrate that collusion is more likely under high demand uncertainty and high competition at the retail level but is less likely under high competition at the manufacturer level.

Although effective in reducing staffing level, hence labor cost, the potential impact of just-intime scheduling on workers' productivity and the firm's revenue is not well understood. Using a data set of 1,444,044 transactions from 25 stores of a full-service casual dining restaurant chain in the United States, we study how just-in-time scheduling impacts worker productivity. We consider two types of just-in-time schedules: (1) short-notice schedules that are assigned to servers shortly before the day of service (mostly two days in our data) and (2) real-time schedules that are assigned to servers on the day of service. We show that short-notice schedules do not harm server productivity overall, but real-time schedules do by 4.4%. Our analysis indicates this may be because servers reduce their upselling and cross-selling efforts when working on real-time schedules. We then propose an analytical scheduling model that accounts for both the value of staffing flexibility created through just-in-time scheduling and its impact on server productivity to inform the firm how to use just-in-time scheduling to improve profitability. Through a case study, we demonstrate that with the 4.4% productivity loss during the real-time schedules, the managers should shift from the heavy use of real-time scheduling toward scheduling more servers with longer advance notice. Such a shift not only provides more predictable work schedules for the workers but can also improve restaurants' expected profit by up to 1%, a significant number for the low-margin restaurant industry. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This study addresses this gap and builds on Strategic Niche Management and the Multi-level Perspective to distinguish two different niche actors: prosumers on the demand-side applying a niche innovation in a disruptive way to regime incumbents’ business model, and new entrants on the supply-side applying the niche innovation symbiotically with the regime. We examine incumbent responses to these different niche actors in different competitive and policy environments. Studying the United States’ electricity industry's sustainability transition toward solar from 2010-2017, we find that as more niche actors enter, regime incumbents are more likely to invest in the niche innovation, but the effect is influenced by policy and competitiveness of the environment. In competitive environments, incumbents are more likely to respond to disruptive niche actors (prosumers), while in traditional monopoly-like markets they are more likely to respond to symbiotic niche actors. We also find that the prosumer effect is stronger when the time that policies in support of the niche innovation have existed is shorter, indicating a potential substituting relationship of niche actors and policy. Our work contributes to the extant literature by demonstrating that the interplay between different niche actors needs to be understood within the context of policy, and that considering policy without accounting for the competitive environment may omit an important aspect of how regime actors become active participants in sustainability transitions. © 2021","incumbent response; niche actors and competition; prosumers; solar power; strategic niche management; sustainability transitions","Commerce; Competition; Demand side management; Investments; Business modeling; Competitive environment; Electricity industry; Incumbent response; Market niche; Regime shift; Strategic niche management; Sustainability transition; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107729275

It does so by applying an Intersectional Risk Theory (IRT) framework to new empirical data on gender equality initiatives in the Canadian screen industries. The paper shows (1) that gendered risk perceptions constrain women directors’ work opportunities; (2) that the construction of gendered risk perceptions (“doing risk”) is shaped by the screen industry context and social inequalities generally; and (3) that practices of constructing risk perceptions can be disrupted and changed, which creates opportunities for a “re-doing” or “un-doing” of gendered perceptions of risk and offers new analytical perspectives onto the efficacy of gender equality initiatives. By interrogating how perceptions of risk inform decision-making, the paper contributes new understandings of the drivers of systemic and intersectional inequality as a defining characteristic of work and labor markets in the screen industries and in the creative industries more broadly. © 2021 The Authors.

It serves as the largest net electricity exporter in Latin America. Nonetheless, the country´s electricity consumption per capita is one of the lowest in the world and the transmission and distribution network has one of the highest losses in Latin America. This paper presents an electricity expansion investment outlook (2018–2040) for Paraguay using OSeMOSYS, analyzing three electricity demand scenarios under different electricity export prices to Brazil. The study identifies the least-cost power generation mix, future investments and the financial requirements to meet the needs of different demand scenarios. We find that Paraguay will need to invest in hydropower plants, by mainly expanding the capacity of Yacyreta to cover its electricity needs and sustain national electricity exports levels. In the High demand scenario, where the electricity demand could approximately double by 2040, the country's overall electricity exports decrease by 50% compared to the Reference scenario. Based on the different scenarios examined, the government spends approximately 18.3–31.2 billion USD on power plant investments for the period 2018–2040 to cover future electricity demand. The findings could be useful in supporting decision-making concerning socio-economic development pathways in the country. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cost-optimization; Demand scenarios; Energy planning; Investment outlook; OSeMOSYS; Project finance","Decision making; Economics; Electric power utilization; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Investments; Electricity demands; Electricity exporters; Electricity-consumption; Financial requirements; Power generation mix; Power plant investment; Socio-economic development; Transmission and distribution; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099302574

Several approaches were developed to implement sustainability assessments at the organisation level. However, the majority are still for the private sector and are often not supported by active stakeholder involvement. Several PSO have adapted private-oriented models to assess their sustainability performance, which are often not adequate due to public administration, whose main mission is to provide public services. The present work aims at developing a conceptual framework to support PSO and to assess their sustainability performance. The proposed approach is supported by two sustainability performance assessment systems – Formal and Informal Sustainability Performance Assessment. The Formal Sustainability Performance Assessment system, which is the main focus of this paper, consists of a checklist of objectives and practices and a set of twenty-nine (29) performance indicators. An initial proposal was drawn from the literature review and then assessed through a participatory process involving practitioners and academics in semi-structured interviews, questionnaire surveys and a collaborative workshop. The Portuguese central public administration was used as a case study. The developed checklist of objectives and practices and related performance indicators will allow PSO to assess and communicate complex information about organisational sustainability. Reference values support the normalization of indicators’ results, and consequently, the comparison of sustainability-related performance between PSO integrated into the context of the Portuguese central public administration. This research contributes to the debate on organisational sustainability assessment and communication, and the importance of selecting and developing sustainability indicators using co-creation processes with key stakeholders. © 2021","Performance assessment and management; Public organisations; Stakeholder engagement; Strategies and practices; Sustainability indicators","Benchmarking; Public administration; Surveys; Performance assessment; Performance assessment systems; Performance management; Public organizations; Public sector organization; Stakeholder engagement; Strategy and practice; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114129999

In addition to sales outcome controls, inside sales managers use phone operational outcomes to influence inside sales agent performance, supporting the need to expand the broader definition of outcome controls. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the need to bifurcate outcome controls into two distinct variables: sales and phone operational controls. Researchers know little about the application of sales outcome controls beyond sales-only outcomes, which, in turn, limits the definition of outcome controls. Design/methodology/approach: Through the utilization of survey, secondary operational data and sales manager’s feedback, this paper demonstrates that the definition of outcome controls needs to be divided into two distinct areas, sales and phone operational controls for inside sales agents, which, in turn, acts collectively to impact an inside sales agent’s job performance and satisfaction. Findings: This research demonstrates that inside sales managers depend on both sales and phone operational outcome controls to drive sales agent performance, varying in degrees by industry. Even as inside sales managers focus on creating an employee-centric autonomous motivational work culture, the overarching controlling factors associated with phone operational outcomes dampen an inside sales agent’s performance and job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, as the first sales control research to examine an inside sales context, this study provides support to further study sales controls in an inside sales context. This research can be enhanced by examining business-to-consumer inside sales environments, behavior controls, greater sample size and additional work outcomes such as turnover and tenure. Practical implications: The findings have important implications because they can help practitioners understand the effect that both sales and phone operational outcomes have on sales agent performance. It also illuminates the need for inside sales managers to be less controlling in their focus on phone operational outcomes, as such a practice has a negative influence on key sales agent job outcomes. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to triangulate multiple data sources to illustrate the need to evaluate both sales and phone operational outcomes as broader components of sales outcome controls. The study of sales controls in a different sales context suggests that sales management controls may differ by sales context, opening the door to extend the vast sales control literature beyond its current context of outside sales. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Autonomous motivation; Control systems; Inside sales; Job satisfaction; Operational outcome controls; Outcome controls; Performance measurement; Personal selling; Sales; Sales management; Sales management culture; Sales performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111122914

The candidate prices belong to a wide range of a price interval; the modeling of the demand functions is nonparametric in nature, imposing only smoothness regularity conditions. One important aspect of our model is the possibility of the expected reward function to be nonconcave and indeed multimodal, which leads to many conceptual and technical challenges. Our proposed algorithm is inspired by both the Upper-Confidence-Bound algorithm for multiarmed bandit and the Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty principle arising from linear contextual bandits. The multiarmed bandit formulation arises from local-bin approximation of an unknown continuous demand function, and the linear contextual bandit formulation is then applied to obtain more accurate local polynomial approximators within each bin. Through rigorous regret analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves optimal worst-case regret over a wide range of smooth function classes. More specifically, for k-times smooth functions and T selling periods, the regret of our proposed algorithm is Õ(T(K+1)/(2K+1)), which is shown to be optimal via the development of information theoretical lower bounds. We also show that in special cases, such as strongly concave or infinitely smooth reward functions, our algorithm achieves an O(√- T) regret, matching optimal regret established in previous works. Finally, we present computational results that verify the effectiveness of our method in numerical simulations.

Furthermore, both instrumental variables estimates and the timing of gains suggest a causal relationship.

This paper focuses on unfinished infrastructure megaprojects and employs the escalation of commitment as a theoretical perspective. It addresses the following research question: How political polarization fosters escalation of commitment leading to unfinished infrastructure megaprojects? The paper employs a longitudinal case study, the USD 13 billion Mexico City New International Airport, recently terminated during the construction phase due to a political decision. The paper describes the interplay between the development of infrastructure megaprojects and political polarization.

The notion of coherency is central to this, which implies that the hierarchical time series follows some linear aggregation constraints. This notion, however, does not take several modelling uncertainties into account. We propose to redefine coherency as stochastic. This allows to accommodate overlooked uncertainties in forecast reconciliation. We show analytically that there are two potential sources of uncertainty in forecast reconciliation. We use simulated data to demonstrate how these uncertainties propagate to the covariance matrix estimation, introducing uncertainty in the reconciliation weights matrix. This then increases the uncertainty of the reconciled forecasts. We apply our understanding to modelling accident and emergency admissions in a UK hospital. Our analysis confirms the insights from stochastic coherency in forecast reconciliation.

Grounded in organizational learning theory, this study empirically demonstrates the impact of BDA implementation on organizational performance and how industry environment characteristics moderate the BDA-performance relationships. Using secondary data regarding BDA implementation from 2010 to February 2020, we find that BDA implementation has a significant impact on two types of business value creation: operational efficiency and business growth. Furthermore, the impact of BDA on operational efficiency is amplified in less dynamic and complex environments, while the BDA-business growth relationship is more pronounced in more dynamic, complex, and munificent environments. Collectively, this study provides a theory-centric understanding of BDA's economic benefits. The findings offer insights to firms about what actual benefits BDA implementation may generate and how firms may align the use of BDA with the industry environments they are operating in. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data and analytics implementation; Industry environment; Longitudinal study; Organizational learning theory","Economic analysis; Efficiency; Industrial economics; Knowledge management; Big data and analytic implementation; Business growth; Economic values; Firm Performance; Industry environment; Industry research; Longitudinal study; Operational efficiencies; Organisational; Organizational learning theory; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109731190

The present study, involving one of the leading electronics distributors in the world, aims to improve prediction accuracy under high demand volatility for procurement managers to make better inventory decisions. In response to requests for an integrated forecasting methodology, we undertook an iterative process based on three guiding principles—data pooling, theory-informed feature engineering, and ensemble-based machine learning. The resulting framework managed to improve forecast accuracy significantly and is applicable to a broad range of situations. We present reflections and insights derived abductively through engagement with managers in this problem situation. This “problem-driven” process corresponds to intervention as a research strategy that can foster theoretical and methodological innovations in OM. Our contribution goes beyond the development of the prediction framework as it elucidates ways OM researchers could leverage theoretical foundations to inform feature derivation and model construction.

We investigate the dynamic consequences of CEO internal performance attributions along a CEO's tenure. CEO internal attributions create an expectation that favorable firm performance will continue under the CEO's leadership. When firm performance turns negative, however, financial analysts also make internal attributions, pointing to the strategies highlighted by the CEO as the cause of performance downfall. Analysts' internal attributions provide a board with a legitimate account casting doubt on the CEO's leadership efficacy, increasing the likelihood of dismissal. We find strong empirical support for our hypotheses in a panel dataset that tracks CEO and analyst interviews in news media around quarterly earnings announcements. Managerial Summary: While prior studies of chief executive officers (CEOs) dismissal have considered different factors leading to CEO dismissal, our study highlights the role played by the CEO's own public performance attributions. Our results show that when CEOs attribute positive performance outcome to their leadership, financial analysts are also more likely to attribute subsequent negative performance outcomes to their leadership, which in turn ultimately leads to CEO dismissal. Given the difficulty of predicting firm performance over an extended period of time, CEOs should be aware that when they take credit for positive performance outcomes they may be setting themselves up for subsequent blame from external constituents seeking explanations for negative performance outcomes. Thus, our results suggest that CEOs may stand to gain from more self-effacing behaviors. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CEO dismissal; financial analysts; performance attribution; strategic leadership","Management; Planning; Chief executive officer; Financial analysts; Firm Performance; Internal performance; News media; Performance outcome; Strategic choice; Earnings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107360756

In this paper, we uncover a heretofore unknown benefit: we establish that resource flexibility facilitates learning the demand when the latter is censored, which could, in turn, enable firms to make better-informed future operational decisions, thereby increasing profitability. Further, we quantify these learning benefits of flexibility and find that they could be of the same order of magnitude as the extensively studied risk-pooling benefits of flexibility. This suggests that flexibility’s learning benefits could be a first-order consideration and that extant theories, which view flexibility only as the ability to act ex post, could be underestimating its true value when learning the demand is desirable, for example, when it enables managers to make better ex ante capacity, assortment, or pricing decisions in future periods.

Project companies often use outsourced providers that require capacity reservations that must be contracted before task durations are realized. We model these decisions for a company that, given partially characterized distributional information, assumes the worstcase distribution for task durations. Once task durations are realized, the project company makes decisions about fast tracking and outsourced crashing, to minimize the total capacity reservation, fast tracking, crashing, and makespan penalty costs. We model the company's objective using the target-based measure of minimizing an underperformance riskiness index. We allow for correlation in task performance, and for piecewise linear costs of crashing and makespan penalties. An optimal solution of the discrete, nonlinear model is possible for small to medium size projects. We compare the performance of our model against the best available benchmarks from the robust optimization literature, and show that it provides lower risk and greater robustness to distributional information. Our work thus enables more effective risk minimization in projects, and provides insights about how to make more robust capacity reservation decisions. Summary of Contribution: This work studies a financially significant planning problem that arises in project management. Companies that face uncertainties in project execution may need to reserve capacity with outsourced providers. Given that decision, they further need to plan their operational decisions to protect against a bad outcome. We model and solve this problem via adjustable distributionally robust optimization. While this problem involves two-stage decision making, which is computationally challenging in general, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm to find the exact optimal solution for instances of practical size. © 2021 INFORMS.","adjustable distributionally robust optimization; capacity reservation; optimal algorithm; project management","Benchmarking; Decision making; Optimal systems; Optimization; Piecewise linear techniques; Adjustable distributionally robust optimization; Capacity reservation; Distributional information; Fast-Tracking; Makespan; Optimal algorithm; Optimal solutions; Project company; Robust capacity; Robust optimization; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132318268

The supplier is allowed to deviate below the order quantity by at most the flexibility fraction. The supplier's regular production is subject to random disruption, but she has access to a reliable expedited supply source at a higher marginal cost. Academic/practical relevance: Despite the prevalence of supply-flexibility contracts in practice, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous academic literature examining the optimal design of supply-flexibility contracts. As such, the level of flexibility in practice is usually set on an adhoc basis, with buyers typically reluctant to share risk with suppliers. Our analysis of supply-flexibility contracts informs practice in two ways: First, using analytically supported arguments, it educates managers on the effects of their decisions on the economic outcomes. Second, it shows that the supply-flexibility contract benefits both the supplier and the buyer, regardless of which player chooses how supply risk is allocated in the supply chain. Methodology: Non-cooperative game theory, non-convex optimization. Results: We derive the supplier-led optimal contract and show that supply chain efficiency improves relative to the price-only contract. More interestingly, even though the buyer lets the supplier decide how the two share supply risk, profits of both the players increase by the introduction of flexibility into the contract. Further, supply flexibility may be even more valuable for the buyer compared with the supplier. Interestingly, the flexibility fraction is not monotone in supplier reliability and a more reliable supplier may even prefer to transfer more risk to the buyer. The robustness of these findings is established on two extensions: One where we study a buyer-led contract (i.e., the buyer chooses the flexibility fraction) and the other where the expedited supply option is available to both the supplier and the buyer. Managerial implications: The supply-flexibility contract is mutually beneficial for both players and yet retains all the advantages of the price-only contract-it is easy to implement, it requires minimal operational and administrative burden, and there is evidence of the use of such contracts in practice. While our focus is not on supply chain coordination, we note that the combination of two mechanisms-the supply-flexibility contract derived in this paper to share supply risk and a buyback contract to share demand risk-yields a coordinating contract. © 2020 INFORMS.","Disruption risk; Supply chain efficiency; Supply-flexibility contract","Convex optimization; Costs; Efficiency; Game theory; Managers; Supply chains; Disruption risk; Exposed to; Flexibility contracts; Ordering quantity; Problem definition; Random demand; Supply chain efficiency; Supply risk; Supply-flexibility contract; Whole sale prices; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116675056

Using detailed data on vehicle sales in four major Chinese cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing), this study investigates the impact of boycotts on sales and advertising effectiveness of products from different countries of origin. The boycott dramatically reduced the market share of Japanese brands and benefitted Chinese and non-Japanese foreign brands. Consumer switching to other brands accounted for the majority of the loss in sales. Advertising became less effective for Japanese brands during the boycott but more effective for non-Japanese brands, especially at the parent-brand level (e.g., Toyota) than sub-brand level (e.g., Camry). The sales impacts were strongest in Nanjing, the city that had the most atrocious war experience with Japan during the Battle of Nanjing in 1937, and weakest in Beijing, where local government agencies explicitly discouraged public demonstrations. Finally, although the decline in sales of Japanese brands did not vary by quality or production location, competing non-Japanese brands that were had better quality or were manufactured locally benefitted more. © 2020 INFORMS.","Advertising; Animosity; Automobile; Before–after research design; Boycott; Country of origin","Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Competition; Advertising effectiveness; Chinese cities; Japanese products; Local government; Market share; Nanjing; Production locations; Tianjin; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111930372

A methods assessment was used to identify core concepts in Arctic shipping and to develop a modelling approach that integrates together policy, alternative fuels, emissions and microeconomic theory - enabling the exploration of financial and implicit damage costs, opportunities and environmental risks within Arctic shipping. The integration of these paradigms can lead to more detailed insights into the economic feasibility of Arctic routes under different policy scenarios. The results indicate that by 2035 under both a business as usual and an Arctic zero emission ECA policy scenario, combined Arctic-Suez transits becomes financially viable for a Handymax wet bulker with a moderate ice class. By 2050 the transpolar route becomes accessible for 5 months for these vessels. The results also show that implicit damage costs cannot be overlooked and that it is possible to advance towards more holistic methods for assessing economic and environmental risks and opportunities in Arctic shipping.

Previous studies on e-participation have shown that this form of participation can increase the level of flexibility and inclusiveness of public engagements, make government interventions more responsive to citizens' needs, and increase government accountability. While there is a growing use of e-participation in the planning systems of developed countries, its application in developing countries has remained very limited. This paper explores the barriers to employing e-participation in the context of a developing country's planning system, using Iran as a case study. We have conducted interviews with different planning actors, including both public- and private-sector planners, to investigate what they perceive as such barriers. The results of this study show that the primary barriers to e-participation in Iran are attitudes towards participation, the structure and culture of the planning system, and staff capacity to engage the public through e-participation. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations regarding how these barriers can be overcome. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; E-participation; Information and communication technologies; Iran; Planning","accountability; decision making; developing world; governance approach; information and communication technology; participatory approach; planning process; private sector; public sector; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107592458

The results are robust to a number of specifications, including an instrumental variable approach that addresses the endogeneity of internet penetration. We also find some evidence showing that the impact of internet penetration on research output quantity decreases as the size of fixed broadband users increase in an economy.

This is true whether capacity is considered from a cost accounting framework, an engineering standpoint, or an economics orientation. Ultimately, the crux of the capacity question is about resources not being used to their fullest extent. In an economics context, understanding where firms are producing on their average cost curve provides information about whether capacity utilization is greater than, less than or equal to unity. In real life, most firms are multi-output, multi-input in nature which makes estimation of capacity utilization and capacity output challenging if a cost based measure is desired. This is further complicated in a short run analysis incorporating multiple outputs and multiple fixed inputs where the relevant concept is the minimum of ray average cost. This paper develops appropriate mathematical programming models for measuring capacity utilization in the short-run for multiple-outputs and multiple fixed inputs. We offer a simple transformation that linearizes the non-linear DEA problem to estimate average, or ray average cost, and to determine capacity utilization and optimal output. The models are empirically tested on data from a number of U.S. electricity producers for the single output case, and a sample of dental practices for the multi-output case. Results show that for both industries, most firms were operating at less than full capacity, and needed to expand output to minimize their average costs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Fixed inputs; Ray average cost; Scale economies","Cost accounting; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Cost functions; Electric utilities; Estimation; Linear transformations; Mathematical programming; Mathematical transformations; Capacity utilization; Dental practice; Electricity producers; Engineering standpoint; Firm Performance; Mathematical programming models; Multiple outputs; Non-parametric; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098479675

A total of 416 valid responses were received from practitioners with experience using WSDs on a construction project. The relative importance and criticality of 25 SFs for WSDs implementation were examined, and survey responses were grouped into general success factors, which were then tested for distinctions across four contingency variables: type of corporation, organization size, levels of Internet of Things (IoT) maturity, and organization experience using WSDs. The results of the statistical analysis revealed the most important SFs for WSDs implementation. The findings of the overall investigation indicate that the critical success factors (CSFs) typically differs depending on the contingency. However, educating and training workers, promoting personalized WSDs, and conducting detailed and continuous assessments of WSDs were identified as key strategies to improve the implementation of WSDs regardless of contingency.

This is particularly true for megaprojects that require higher levels of specialized workforces and exhibit more complicated organizational relationships. To examine the characteristics of megaproject collaboration from a dynamic network perspective, this research selected skyscraper projects as a featured megaproject field. A total of 422 completed skyscraper projects over 250 m in height that were built from 1990 to 2010 worldwide, as well as more than 1,100 participating organizations, were analyzed using social network analysis. Increasingly tight and interwoven collaborative relationships in the discrete-time global skyscraper networks were found, and design firms played a vital role by holding central network positions over time, indicating the importance of the design phase in skyscraper projects. The distinctive interregional and/or intraregional collaboration features were revealed at different geographical settings. Designers, especially those from North America, Europe, and Oceania, were also more active and thus successful in participating in skyscraper projects abroad, mostly in Asia and the Middle East, whereas the general contractors were more generally involved in local projects. The identified preferential attachment phenomenon and regional collaborative features led to the network topology dynamics.

In many cases, this assumption fails to hold, and thus, difficulties will be encountered to some extent when measuring efficiency with a standard DEA model. Ideally, the performance of DMUs with different characteristics could be examined using the DEA meta-frontier framework. However, some of these DMUs are mixed-type DMUs that may affiliate with more than one group. Furthermore, the total number of observations of these mixed-type DMUs is limited. This is one of the common problems when studies focus on faculty research performance in higher education institutions. In general, a faculty member is affiliated with a certain department, and if the departmental assessment policy is not suitable for faculty members who are involved in interdisciplinary research, their performance could be underestimated. Therefore, the proposed model is an extension of the DEA meta-frontier framework that can assess the performance of mixed-type DMUs by constructing the reference set without the same type of DMUs. In this paper, the scientific research efficiency of faculty members at the Inner Mongolia University is used as an example to provide a better understanding of the proposed model. The proposed model is intended to provide a fair and balanced performance assessment method that reflects actual performance, especially for mixed-type DMUs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis; Mixed-type decision-making units; Research efficiency; University","data envelopment analysis; decision making; higher education; research; university sector; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102830118

The proposed 'project life-cycle assessment circularity indicators and themes' (PLACIT) framework supports thematic circularity ratings in construction projects using 12 circularity indicators (CIs), representing high-level requirements of CE, grouped into five themes relevant to project life-cycle stages. This helps identify areas of good practice and those requiring circularity improvements. A systematic literature review, structured in line with PLACIT, revealed an increasing association between CE and 'constructability' but varying engagement with CIs. The predominant engagement with indicators within the industry's comfort zone indicates supply-push practices focusing on aspirational CE design solutions and CE management, missing opportunities from engaging with more demand-pull indicators-for example, reduced material inputs-and embedding circular materials in design practices. Full transition to CE will require engaging with a wide range of indicators throughout the whole project life cycle in a more complex network. Moreover, PLACIT has potentials to set clear boundaries between 'sustainability' and CE concepts, currently ill defined in the literature. Future research (Association for Project Management supported) will seek to validate PLACIT using expert feedback and use circularity ratings to support decision making in construction. © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Circular economy; Project management; Sustainability","Complex networks; Decision making; Life cycle; Project management; Circular economy; Constructability; Construction projects; Good practices; Holistic frameworks; Industry restructuring; Life cycle stages; Project's life cycle; Systematic assessment; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119405091

Peers are known to influence coworker productivity and likely also affect counterproductive behaviors. Academic/practical relevance: Many studies have shown how mechanisms such as helping, knowledge transfer, teaching, and social pressure generate productivity peer effects in service and other settings. Yet few papers empirically examine these effects in counterproductive behaviors. We argue that while the same mechanisms driving productivity spillovers also generate peer effects in misconduct, an additional effect - strategic peer response - reflects how coworkers, under managerial monitoring, adjust misconduct in response to peers' daily behavior. An additional contribution of this paper is to identify the effect of peers on operational performance in a firm setting. Methodology: We use transaction and theft data from 83,153 servers at 1,049 restaurants across 46 states in the United States. We employ instrumental variable (IV) models to account for both reflection problems and correlated error terms in same-day peer theft. We use Monte Carlo simulations to present how biases identified by a combination of ordinary least squares (OLS) and IV models suggest that managerial oversight might generate negative correlation in the same-day error terms of peers that reflects strategic peer responses. Results: Our results show that although servers are more likely to steal when working with high-theft peers, they steal less as peers steal more on a given day. We also show that this negative correlation in daily peer theft is higher under an information technology system that increases managerial oversight by reporting likely theft to managers. Importantly, we demonstrate how reflection effects can significantly amplify even small peer-effect coefficients to have large organizational implications. Our parameter estimates indicate that doubling a single worker's average theft amount will increase total theft in an average restaurant by 76%. Doubling all workers' theft amounts increases totals by 550%. Finally, we show that the positive peer effect from high-theft coworkers only exists for new workers in their first three to five months on the job, consistent with imprinting mechanisms that include knowledge transfer and norms. Managerial implications: The results show that the costs of employing unethical workers is higher than the direct cost of those workers' misconduct because their behavior spills over into coworkers' actions and amplifies through reflection effects.

However, frequent site switching can lead to increased setup and overhead costs. Specifically, workers expend significant time and cognitive effort getting reoriented with personnel, operating processes, tools, and resources whenever they switch sites. In this paper, we look at the productivity and quality implications of multisite work. Academic/practical relevance: Although multisite workplace deployment is increasingly common, its impact on people operations has not been examined in the operations management literature. We contribute to the literature by studying the effect of multisiting on individual worker productivity and quality of output. Methodology: To estimate the effect of multisite operations on performance, we turn to a setting where multisite worker assignment is common - that of physicians who have admitting privileges at multiple hospitals. We collected detailed data on individual physicians practicing in 83 hospitals between 1999 and 2010. Our extensive data set includes detailed operational and clinical factors associated with more than 950,000 patient encounters. Our empirical analysis takes the form of a panel, where we follow a given physician over time and link short-term multisiting to patient-level outcomes. Results: We find that multisiting negatively impacts productivity. Specifically, for each additional site at which a physician works, we observe a 2% increase in patient length of stay. For each site served, the likelihood of a patient developing a complication increases by 3%. Greater travel distance between sites and lack of focus at a given site explain the performance declines due to multisiting. In addition, we find that the performance declines resulting from multisite operation are reduced among low-complexity patients and among highly experienced physicians. Managerial implications: Multisite performance losses need to be traded off against the potential benefits. The negative effects ofmultisiting can be mitigated by limiting multisite deployment to simpler tasks and among highly experienced physicians. Managers can decrease switching costs of multisite work by standardizing workflows, processes, and tools across sites. In addition, the practice of multisite work can be limited to sites that are physically proximate to avoid the overhead costs associated with excessive travel. © 2020 INFORMS.","Hospital operations; Multisite operations; Operational familiarity; Productivity","Hospitals; Managers; Empirical analysis; Managerial implications; Operations management; Physical locations; Potential benefits; Problem definition; Worker assignments; Worker productivities; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114005398

We focus on the hospital emergency department (ED) as a service setting in which nurses (servers) have discretion over how they interact with patients (customers) in a facility that introduces significant heterogeneity in necessary walking distance. Academic/practical relevance: Prior studies on facility layout in operations have largely focused on the direct effect of transit times on reduced productivity. We extend this work to show how skilled service workers such as nurses adapt their work behavior to enhance their productivity in response to facility layout constraints. Methodology: To study this empirically, we utilize a unique data set consisting of infrared nurse location tracking data, patient electronic medical record data, bedside patient call data, and the architectural floor plan of a large academic ED. Results: Nurses working in a busy ED appear to reduce their walking distance by batching their tasks to distant patient rooms. Although the patients in these rooms receive the same amount of care time, this behavior results in longer wait times between nurse visits and more nurse call button activations, but it does not compromise the overall quality of care delivered. Nurse call button use is linked with poor patient satisfaction and interrupts nurse workflow. Managerial implications: These findings show that even in services, facility layout can lead to servers using task timing discretion in ways that help the server but lead to a additional waiting time for the customer. We propose countering the negative effects of distancebased task batching through proactive nurse rounding and operational transparency. © 2020 INFORMS.","Behavioral operations; Empirical service operations management; Facility layout; Healthcare operations management; Service worker behavior","Emergency rooms; Emergency services; Fasteners; Medical computing; Plant layout; Productivity; Architectural floor plans; Electronic medical record; Emergency departments; Hospital emergency departments; Managerial implications; Patient satisfaction; Problem definition; Service facilities; Nursing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114000651

Academic/practical relevance: A knowledgeable retail sales associate (SA) can explain the features of available product variants and give a customer sufficient confidence in the customer's choice or suggest alternatives so that the customer becomes willing to purchase. Although it is plausible that increasing an SA's product knowledge will increase sales, training is not without cost and turnover is high in retail, so most retailers provide little product-knowledge training. Methodology: We partner with two firms and collect data on more than 50,000 SAs who had access to training. We assemble a detailed data set of the training history and individual sales productivity over a two-year period. We conduct econometric analysis to quantify the causal effect of training on sales. Results: For SAs who engaged in training, the sales rate increases by 1.8% for every online module taken, which is a much higher benefit than the direct or indirect costs associated with this training. Brand-specific training has a larger effect on the focal brand; however, there is a positive effect on other brands the SA sells. We also assess how the training benefit varies depending on the SA's tenure, sales rate prior to training, and number of modules taken. Managerial implications: We present evidence of a novel training mechanism that can be extremely attractive to retailers. Online training tools, such as the one we study, have two characteristics that should not be overlooked. First, it is the brands, not the retailers, that create, develop, and pay for the training content. Second, the incentives are such that SAs invest their own time, rather than time on the job, to train, and this makes the retailer's investment in the training a profitable proposition. © 2020 INFORMS.","Data analytics; Empirical operations; Online learning; People operations; Retail","Costs; Online systems; Personnel training; Productivity; Sales; Econometric analysis; Managerial implications; Online training; Problem definition; Product feature; Product knowledge; Product variants; Sales productivity; E-learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113941485

In turn, CEOs can influence important decisions related to changes in R&D spending—the kind of spending with the potential to lead to innovation. We seek to understand the motivation and conditions under which CEOs may influence R&D spending changes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, this study investigates how CEO motivation affects changes in firm R&D spending. We explore the effect of CEO promotion and prevention foci on yearly R&D increase. We use a panel dataset of 688 S&P 1500 firms to test our hypotheses. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase, while CEO promotion focus produces no meaningful effect. We further test CEO compensation as a moderating mechanism, testing both incentive and fixed CEO compensation. We find that incentive compensation negatively moderates the relationship between CEO promotion focus and R&D increase, and positively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Additionally, CEO fixed income negatively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Based on these results we discuss theoretical implications of our findings, including differing effects of CEO regulatory focus on firm risk-taking behavior and how compensation packages may alter those effects. We further discuss the practical necessity for boards of directors to understand both the R&D goals of an organization and the individual motivational orientation of CEOs when crafting compensation packages. © 2021 Product Development & Management Association","CEO compensation; CEO motivation; R&D; regulatory focus theory","Motivation; Risk management; Statistical tests; Boards of directors; CEO compensations; Compensation packages; Incentive compensation; Motivational orientation; Regulatory focus; Research and development; Risk-taking behaviors; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111803966

However, we find that women with children in the store are more likely to run out of stock than both men and women who do not have children in the store.

What information would they prefer to avoid? How does the provision of information bear on welfare? And what does this mean for food policy? Representative surveys in eleven nations find that substantial percentages of people do not want to receive information even when it bears on health, sustainability, and consumer welfare. Nonetheless, substantial percentages of people also do want to receive that information, and people's willingness to pay for information, contingent on their wanting it, is mostly higher than people's willingness to pay not to receive information, contingent on their not wanting it. We develop a model and estimate the welfare effects of information provision. We find substantial benefits and costs, with the former outweighing the latter.

The applicants represented a population influx of displaced people that were accommodated primarily in urban settings, creating challenges for engineers and managers who needed to meet the new water and wastewater demands of the displaced persons without disrupting services to preexisting residents. To achieve this, local authorities and engineers had to consider temporary or permanent alterations to existing water and wastewater infrastructure - changes that could provoke opposition from a hosting community, depending on their perception of the changes. In this study, a modeling framework is proposed that allows decision makers to account for hosting communities' perceptions of alternatives for providing water and wastewater infrastructure services to displaced persons. The framework uses an agent-based model that is enabled by publicly available information, a survey deployed to German communities, and interviews with stakeholders involved in the accommodation of displaced persons in Germany. Our results indicate that alternatives used by local authorities did not always align with community-supported alternatives. To minimize such misalignments, we recommend that local authorities, early on in developing infrastructure alternatives, take into account the perceptions of hosting communities. Ultimately, the proposed framework promotes the sustainable provision of water and wastewater infrastructure to displaced persons. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Agent-based modeling; Displaced persons; Wastewater infrastructure; Water infrastructure","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Decision makers; Local authorities; Model framework; Population influx; Sustainable provision; Urban settings; Water and wastewater; Computational methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105163789

The use of interval forecasts instead of point forecasts allows us to incorporate the apparent forecast uncertainty. When forecasting count time series, one also has to account for the discreteness of the range, which is done by using coherent prediction intervals (PIs) relying on a count model. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis of coherent PIs for diverse types of count processes. We also compare them to approximate PIs that are computed based on a Gaussian approximation. Our analyses rely on an extensive simulation study. It turns out that the Gaussian approximations do considerably worse than the coherent PIs. Furthermore, special characteristics such as overdispersion, zero inflation, or trend clearly affect the PIs' performance. We conclude by presenting two empirical applications of PIs for count time series: the demand for blood bags in a hospital and the number of company liquidations in Germany. © 2020 The Authors.

Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills might have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers. We leverage a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills and IT use, which are also integrated with household labor force survey data on workers’ wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. We find that basic IT skills increase employment probability, and these employment effects can be explained by both increased labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills are not significantly associated with higher employment, conditioning on basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages and incrementally increases the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effects of basic IT skills on employment are significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. Additionally, IT skills complement occupations that have a higher share of nonroutine tasks that cannot be performed by predefined rules. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and basic IT training to traditionally socially disadvantaged groups to reduce the IT skills gap and close the digital divide. We contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the role of different IT skills in the entire labor force across multiple occupations and demographics, going beyond IT professionals and employed workers who have predominantly been studied in the information systems literature. We discuss implications for the future of work and education and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment for workers with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.

To assess the vulnerability of climate change from a land management perspective and spatially identify where the most extreme changes are anticipated to occur, we worked in collaboration with land managers to develop a climate change vulnerability map for the midwestern United States with a focus on riparian systems. The map is intended for use by regional administrators to help them work across various program areas (e.g. fisheries, endangered species) to prioritize locations needing support for adaptation planning. The tool can also be utilized locally by managers to better understand the effects that projected climate scenarios have on the hydrology of management units as they develop adaptation strategies. The vulnerability map is watershed-based (360 watershed units within the region) and combines 15 climate change indicators that were selected by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service natural resource managers based upon known and anticipated effects to species and habitats. The projected change in each of these indicators from the historical period (1986–2005) to the future period (2040–2059) was aggregated into a composite score for each watershed. Landscape-scale metrics reflective of a watershed's adaptive capacity were combined with the climate change indicators to produce a vulnerability score. We found sub-regional variation in vulnerability to climate change with the greatest vulnerability in Iowa, central Illinois, and northwest Ohio. Greater vulnerability was seen in the higher greenhouse gas concentration scenario, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 compared to the lower greenhouse gas concentration scenario RCP 4.5, when looking at the mean of the five downscaled climate models used in this study. By quantifying and mapping climate change vulnerability, natural resource managers can better understand the degree of vulnerability for individual watersheds and identify areas of prioritization in regional and local planning efforts. © 2021 the United States Geological Survey (USGS)","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Hotspot mapping; Indicator; Vulnerability; Watershed modeling","Aquatic ecosystems; Climate models; Conservation; Greenhouse gases; Managers; Mapping; Watersheds; Adaptive capacity; Climate change indicators; Gas concentration; Greenhouses gas; Hotspot mapping; Resource managers; Riparian ecosystem; Vulnerability; Vulnerability maps; Watershed models; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; decision making; greenhouse gas; historical ecology; landscape structure; prioritization; riparian forest; vulnerability; Illinois; Iowa; Midwest; United States; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102975235

A postponement strategy is well recognized as an effective means to deal with supply chain risks and uncertainties of producing customized products. However, coordinated decision-making among product design, postponement contracting and subcontracting is a challenging problem area that requires innovative modeling and decision support. This study develops a model that emphasizes interactive decisions within a three-level non-cooperative game that determines the optimal solutions for a single manufacturer, multiple distributors, and multiple subcontractors by maximizing their net profits. This study formulates a postponement contracting with subcontracting (PCS) problem for product family architecting to interact with postponement contracting and subcontracting decisions based on optimal planning of crowdsourced manufacturing activities. The PCS problem differs from traditional postponement design models that assume a (fixed) product architecture is given at the outset. In this study, interaction among different stakeholders is modeled as a non-linear, mixed-integer, three-level game-theoretic model based on the Stackelberg game theory. A novel virtual postponement structure is introduced to concretize optimization of the PCS problem and to justify which product module(s) should be postponed. Analytical solutions are developed incorporating a nested genetic algorithm. A practical case study of postponement contracting decisions in an electric vehicle company is reported to verify the feasibility and potential of the proposed approach for product family architecting. The optimal product family design, the types of postponed product modules, some parts in the postponed product modules that need to be further subcontracted, and other decision results are determined simultaneously in the case study. The sensitivity analyses on the proposed postponement cost and demand parameters indicate that the changes of their values greatly influence the decision makers’ net profit, and the net profit situation of each decision maker in different regions is obtained by the sensitivity analysis of the union of the two parameters. Thus, the PCS problem for product family architecting in crowdsourced manufacturing provides a more complete solution for the current implementation of the postponement strategy, and our proposed three-level game-theoretic model can handle well the coordination among the PCS problem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crowdsourced manufacturing; Manufacturing; Postponement; Product family; Stackelberg game; Supply chain management","Automobile manufacture; Crowdsourcing; Decision making; Decision support systems; Genetic algorithms; Product design; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Coordinated decision; Game-theoretic model; Manufacturing activities; Manufacturing resource; Noncooperative game; Postponement strategies; Product architecture; Product family design; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094888855

This decline, perplexing in the face of rising per capita income when malnutrition is rampant, has been termed India’s Calorie Consumption Puzzle. It has been partially attributed to a squeeze in the household food budget. This study employs Stochastic Cost Frontier Analysis to evaluate this explanation, upon the logic that such a squeeze shall likely result in the rising cost-efficiency of calorie purchases, that is, the more economical purchase of calories. Analysis of household expenditure data from India’s National Sample Survey reveals that Indian households’ purchase of calories did become more cost-efficient at every level of income, suggesting that there was indeed a squeeze in the household food budget, making this a viable explanation of the Calorie Consumption Puzzle. Besides thus investigating India’s Calorie Consumption Puzzle, this study demonstrates a novel application of Stochastic Cost Frontier Analysis, to consumption instead of the more common production, in that the method has not previously been applied to the consumption of multiple items treated as inputs yielding an output. Stochastic Cost Frontier Analysis applied to calorie acquisition may be a new way of gauging changes over time in food security, with a rise in cost-efficiency indicating a squeeze in the food budget or declining food security. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Calorie consumption puzzle; Stochastic cost frontier analysis","econometrics; food security; frontier region; malnutrition; numerical model; stochasticity; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091612003

Overall, an average dynamic productivity change for both global and non-global firms is negative, with − 0.4%, although there is heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the growth rates across both groups of firms. The productivity change differences come from the technological regress for non-global firms in spite of the technological progress experienced by global firms.

The self-employed are at higher risk of income volatility while facing lower levels of social insurance. Individual transitions into self-employment may be driven by a range of factors, both 'pull' and 'push'. This paper proposes a re-evaluation of the evidence on whether private sector business organizations stimulate entrepreneurial transmission amongst their employees. In the UK context rising self-employment may reflect the consequences of flexibilization and falling job quality, rather than outright job loss. Previous research has focused mainly on the subjective notion of job satisfaction to identify the level of attachment the future self-employed have to their current employer. Quantitative analysis is undertaken using large scale British longitudinal survey data. The paper extends this work to show that organizational (dis)attachment is evidenced in a range of extrinsic indicators of job quality, providing explanatory information beyond intrinsic job satisfaction. Specifically, the paper shows that the impact of training on self-employment entry depends asymmetrically on the source of that training. Finally, the paper argues that reduced attachment provides an alternative explanation for any 'entrepreneurial transmission' effect, through which employees, particularly those in smaller organizations, are more likely to enter self-employment. However, anticipated improvement in the experience of work from choosing self-employment is seen to be somewhat illusory, speaking to growing concerns about the impact of the growth of the gig economy. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We find that threshold approval voting is qualitatively superior, and also performs well in experiments using data from real participatory budgeting elections. © 2020 INFORMS.","Artificial intelligence; Group decisions; Utility preference theory; Voting committees","Management; Operations research; Computational social choices; Individual preference; Preference elicitation; Public funds; Real-world; Social welfare; Value for monies; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106684421

Using a rural region in Northern New York (USA), we consider the investment and operational costs of a broadband cooperative and determine service prices for which it is financially viable. Service prices need to increase 75%–131%, depending on grant restrictions, relative to existing market prices for a new broadband cooperative to become financially feasible. Put differently, the cooperative would not cash flow at market prices unless there was at least 14 potential subscribers per mile at a 62% take rate. For a cooperative, the grant restriction that providers offer a minimum level of speed at a maximum price results in a high level of subsidization by high-speed to low-speed members to support the business. Given grant funding and member equity investments, financial infeasibility has little to do with construction costs, than with annual operational and maintenance costs required to sustain the system long term. More reasonable feasibility scenarios occur for existing utility cooperatives expanding services into broadband, particularly areas with a high proportion of high-speed, year-round users and strong take rates. Consideration of public benefits of broadband arguably needs to be added to the equation, particularly surrounding access to healthcare and educational purposes, and as a prerequisite to supporting taxpayer-funded public-private partnerships to expand broadband services. Policy levers to eliminate or subsidize property taxes and pole rental costs reduce cash flow prices considerably; however, feasibility is highly sensitive to assumed take rates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cooperatives; Cumulative cash flow analysis; Financial feasibility; Rural broadband","Commerce; Investments; Rural areas; Taxation; Broadband service; Construction costs; Equity investment; Maintenance cost; Property taxes; Public private partnerships; Rural broadband; Service prices; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100868117

AMR refers to the ability of microbes to evolve resistance to those treatments designed to kill them, and is associated with the overuse or misuse of medicines such as antibiotics. AMR is an emerging global challenge with major implications for healthcare and society as a whole. Diagnostic tests for infectious diseases can guide decision making when prescribing medicines, so reducing inappropriate drug use. In the context of growing international interest in policies to stimulate innovation in AMR diagnostics, this study uses multicriteria mapping (MCM) to appraise a range of policy instruments in order to understand their potential performance while also highlighting the uncertainties that stakeholders hold about such interventions in complex contexts. A contribution of the article is the demonstration of a novel method to analyse and visualise MCM data in order to reveal stakeholder inclinations towards particular options while exploring interviewees’ uncertainties about the effectiveness of each instrument's design or implementation. The article reports results from six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK). The findings reveal which policy instruments are deemed most likely to perform well, and why, across stakeholder groups and national settings, with areas of common ground and difference being identified. Importantly, the conclusions presented here differ from prominent policy discourse, with international implications for the design of mixes of policy instruments to combat AMR. Strategic and practical methodological implications also emerge for general appraisal of innovation policy instrument mixes. © 2020 The Authors","Antimicrobial resistance; Diagnostic innovation; Foresight appraisal; Multicriteria mapping; Policy evaluation; Policy instrument mixes","Decision making; Mapping; Microorganisms; Uncertainty analysis; Antimicrobial resistances; European Countries; Global challenges; Infectious disease; Innovation policy instruments; Policy instruments; Research policies; Stakeholder groups; Diagnosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099119557

A natural question is whether we can extend the BTS framework to prediction markets (not just polls). To do so, this paper proposes two estimators, one based on a prediction market alone and the other based on both the market and a poll question. We show that both estimators are consistent within the BTS framework, under different sets of regularity conditions. Simulations are conducted to examine the convergence of different estimators.

This paper extends this research by considering how loyalty affects firms’ decisions to facilitate search for nonloyal consumers. We show that in equilibrium, the store with more loyal customers ends up having lower search costs even if facilitating search is costless. The intuition for this result is that nonloyal consumers expect higher prices at a store with a larger loyal segment, and therefore, this store has to set a lower search cost to counteract the negative effect of this expectation. Given this, it is optimal for the other store to set a higher search cost to avoid intensifying price competition. As a consequence, a larger loyal segment may lead to both higher prices and a higher market share among nonloyal customers. In other words, an advantage in customer loyalty leads to the store becoming the search hub of the nonloyal customers. This, in turn, implies that even a small advantage in customer loyalty may lead to a large increase in profits and may help explain why some managers place such a high value on earning customer loyalty. © 2020 INFORMS","Competitive strategy; Game theory; Loyalty; Pricing; Search costs","Commerce; Competition; Managers; Sales; Academic research; Customer loyalty; Market share; Price competition; Search costs; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105357131

Assuming one uses human judgment indirectly in this manner, we propose changing the elicitation question from the traditional direct forecast (DF) to what we call the private information adjustment (PIA): how much the human thinks the algorithm should adjust its forecast to account for information the human has that is unused by the algorithm. Using stylized models with and without random error, we theoretically prove that human random error makes eliciting the PIA lead to more accurate predictions than eliciting the DF. However, this DF-PIA gap does not exist for perfectly consistent forecasters. The DF-PIA gap is increasing in the random error that people make while incorporating public information (data that the algorithm uses) but is decreasing in the random error that people make while incorporating private information (data that only the human can use).

However, this concept can be challenging to implement efficiently and effectively for actionable strategies. First, the nature of skewed and sparse product-level data in the clustering process results in less meaningful solutions. Second, customer segmentation becomes challenging on massive data sets due to the computational complexity of traditional clustering methods. Third, market basket analysis may suffer from association rules too general to be relevant for important segments. In this article, we propose to partition customers into groups with their product purchase similarity maximized by detecting communities in the customer-product bipartite graph using the Louvain algorithm. Through a case study using data from a large U.S. retailer, we demonstrate that the proposed method generates interpretable clustering results with distinct product purchase patterns. Comprehensive characteristics of customers and products in each cluster can be inferred with statistical significance since they are essentially driven by products purchased by customers. Compared with the conventional RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) model, the proposed approach leads to higher response rates in the recommendation of products to customers in the same cluster. Our analysis provides greater insights into customer purchase behaviors, improves product recommendation effectiveness, and addresses computational complexity in the context of skewed and sparse big data. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","bipartite graph; community detection; cross-selling; market basket analysis; product affinity segmentation","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Graph algorithms; Population dynamics; Clustering process; Clustering results; Community detection; Customer segmentation; Market basket analysis; Product recommendation; Statistical significance; Traditional clustering; Sales; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; health service; Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Health Services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104610613

As we start to embrace ridesourcing in our daily life, we also rearrange our daily travel amongst different modes of transportation. As the fundamental decisions in travel behavior, car ownership and car travel should be re-examined in the advent of shared mobility. In this paper, we applied a vehicle choice model that factors in ridesourcing frequency to understand the decisions about (1) how many cars an individual would declare as the primary driver of, and (2) the annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for all cars he or she drive. We used a subsample of the latest 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data that focus on the Capital region (Washington, D.C. – Maryland – Virginia) as our study area. We applied a weighted regression analysis following the NHTS survey design and derived population-representative results on both decisions. In addition, we calculated the driving cost for each household vehicle based on the latest fuel economy data and incorporated driving cost into the car travel model. The results suggest that ridesourcing is associated with a smaller chance of an individual being the primary driver of a car. However, the elasticity indicates that ridesourcing usage has a small impact on the number of primarily driven cars. Furthermore, ridesourcing has no significant impact on the annual VMT, either. Driving cost, on the other hand, still plays the key role in determining driving distances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Car ownership; Driving cost; NHTS; Ridesourcing; Survey weights; VMT","Digital storage; Fuel economy; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Driving distance; Impact driving; Initial public offerings; National household travel surveys; Travel behaviors; Vehicle choice; Vehicle-miles traveled; Weighted regression; Surveys; car ownership; cost analysis; regression analysis; survey method; transportation development; transportation mode; travel behavior; District of Columbia; Maryland; United States; Virginia; Washington [District of Columbia]; Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101300322

These include the inadequate glycemic adjustment, care gaps, therapeutic inertia, and a lack of motivation. Personalized diabetes management can be seen as a kind of “standard process” that provides both physicians and patients with a framework. The aim of this empirical survey is the evaluation of patient preferences regarding personalized diabetes management. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the properties of the programs that are relevant for the choice of insulin-based therapy regimens for patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was applied to identify preferences for a personalized diabetes management in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Six attributes were included. The DCE was conducted in June 2017 using a fractional factorial design, and the statistical data analysis used random effect logit models. Results: N = 227 patients (66.1% male) were included. The preference analysis showed dominance for the attribute “occurrence of severe hypoglycemias per year” [level difference (LD) 2765]. Preference analysis also showed that participants weight the “risk of myocardial infarction (over 10 years)” (LD 1.854) highest among the side effects. Within the effectiveness criterion of “change in the long-term blood glucose level (HbA1c)” a change at an initial value of 9.5% (LD 1.146) is weighted slightly higher than changes at 7.5% (LD 1.141). Within the random parameter logit estimation, all coefficients proved to be significantly different from zero at the level p ≤ 0.01. The latent class analysis shows three heterogeneous classes, each showing clearly different weights of the therapeutic properties. This results in a clear three-folding: for 1/3 of the respondents the change of the long-term blood sugar (HbA1c value) is the top objective. Another third is solely interested in the short-term effectiveness of the therapy in the sense of the occurrence of severe hypoglycemias per year. The last third of the interviewees finally focuses on the follow-up regarding cardiovascular events. Overall, there were five structural and personality traits which have an influence on the respective probability of the class membership. Discussion/conclusion: This study identifies and weights the key decision-making criteria for optimal management of diabetes from the perspective of patients. It was shown that the effectiveness of a care program is the most important from the perspective of the patient and avoiding severe a hypoglycemia has the greatest influence on the choice. The risk of myocardial infarction as a follow-up disease and the long-term adjustment of the blood glucose follow the importance. In the analysis of possible subgroup differences by means of latent class analysis, it was found that three preference patterns exist within the sample.

As a new e-commerce phenomenon that appears more in the service industry, it integrates the original third-party platforms and is about to gain considerable development. This paper investigates whether it is favorable for a third-party platform to join the fourth-party platform. The best choice of third-party platform is discussed from three dimensions of profit, consumer surplus and social welfare. The Hotelling model and Pyramid Spatial model are established to describe the competition between different platforms and the choice of agents, and the Stackelberg game is constructed with commission rates as the decision variables. The main conclusions of this study include: i) the impact of commission rates is largely dependent on the business model of the third-party platform, such as the price of the service sold and whether it is consumer-oriented; ii) when the optimal commission rates are adopted by platforms, joining the fourth-party platform can bring greater profits to the consumer-oriented third-party platform and create greater consumer surplus and social welfare. This paper fills the gap of existing literature by providing decision support for the third-party platform under the vigorous development of the fourth-party platform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Commission rate decision; Platform competition; Platform integration; Service differentiation; Stackelberg game","Decision support systems; Profitability; Business modeling; Consumer surplus; Decision supports; Decision variables; Spatial modeling; Stackelberg Games; Three dimensions; Transaction cost; Service industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099860999

Using insights from the literature on goals as reference points and goal-setting theory, we predict that former leaders exert more effort compared to otherwise identical competitors. We test this prediction using two contexts. The first data comes from an educational business simulation game. The second setting draws on field data from a 2-month banking sales contest. We find that provision of effort increases following the loss of leadership. We also explore whether past leaders exert more effort in general or shift effort from other, potentially less-salient goals. We find evidence of both mechanisms. Finally, investigating the temporal effects, we find that having been a leader has an attenuating effect on subsequent behavior. Managerial Summary: Many competitions—such as sports championships, sales contests, idea-sourcing challenges, and competitions for promotions—can be understood as dynamic tournaments, in which rivals rise and fall in the provisional rankings as they compete over time for a terminal prize. This performance volatility can have important consequences for contestants' behavior. Focusing on the event of lost leadership, we show that former leaders try harder: those that are displaced from a prize-eligible position exert more effort in subsequent rounds, compared with identically placed rivals who have never led. Former leaders provide more effort overall, and also shift attention away from other tasks. Our results, which suggest that setbacks can be motivational, have implications for the optimal design of dynamic competitions. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","behavioral strategy; competitive dynamics; dynamic tournaments; lost leadership; reference points","Management; Planning; Behavioral theory; Business simulation games; Dynamic competitions; Goal-setting theories; Optimal design; Provisional ranking; Reference points; Temporal effects; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094635564

Much of this research has involved buyer–supplier exchanges and has often hinged on the assumption that powerful firms negotiate to wield (fully) their power for favorable outcomes. Yet, it is unclear to what extent firms transform their potential power into realized power. Building on insights grounded in resource dependence theory and literature on competitive dynamics and organization design, we theorize that structural factors (i.e., decentralization, spheres of influence, and mutual dependence) constrain firms from fully realizing their potential power. In doing so, we center on a more nuanced context—multimarket buyer–supplier exchanges, wherein buyers and suppliers handle multiple exchanges across different product markets. We use two controlled negotiation experiments to test our hypotheses. Our results show that in multimarket exchanges, three key factors (and how they sometimes interact) constrain power use. These results offer boundary conditions to extant theory. Most profoundly, our results reveal that centralization (traditionally viewed as a structural lever to enhance power use) alone does not affect power use but has distinct effects conditional on other factors—countering theory and challenging best practices in industry. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","bargaining game; economics-based experiment; inter-organizational power; multimarket; negotiation; organization structure; resource dependence theory","Industrial engineering; Operations research; Competitive dynamics; Mutual dependences; Operations management; Organization design; Potential power; Product markets; Resource dependences; Structural factor; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091691254

The main findings indicate that natural gas consumption can significantly promote CO2 emissions for the full sample and non-RCEP countries, and improved technological innovation can help alleviate CO2 emissions from natural gas consumption. In the RCEP countries, technological innovation can improve the carbon emission reduction effect of natural gas.

For this purpose, we develop an epidemic spreading model to explore the dynamics of a viral marketing campaign under network externalities and incentivized individuals. We will examine two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous incentive rates. In each case, we derive an N-intertwined dynamics model and obtain the existence and stability conditions of a trade-free or an endemic equilibrium. By treating the incentive as a control parameter, we investigate the problem of maximizing the monopolist's profit by formulating two nonlinear programming models. In the case of homogeneous incentive rates, results show that the optimal incentive is determined by devising a balance between the consumers’ states in the Markov process. In the heterogeneous case, it is observed that despite the existence of a strong correlation with different centrality measures, the optimal incentive allocation cannot be solely determined by centrality measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamical systems over networks; Epidemic spread; Incentive rate determination; Nonlinear programming; OR in marketing","Commerce; Markov processes; Nonlinear programming; Profitability; Centrality measures; Endemic equilibrium; Epidemic spreading; Existence and stability; Network externality; Nonlinear programming model; Optimal incentives; Sharing information; Marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089446050

Academic/practical relevance: The interconnected issues of water, energy, food, and flood are among the most formidable challenges faced by developing countries worldwide. The development of hydro systems has the potential to address all these issues simultaneously and thus has been prioritized in the international community to reduce poverty and promote sustainable economic development. Methodology: We develop a new integrated and dynamic modeling framework to capture the conflicts of these issues, explore the synergy among different sectors, and maximize overall benefits. The framework integrates hydro plant location and distribution decisions for both power and water; it endogenizes the budget and thus captures the dynamic interaction between water resource development and economic growth. Results:We derive analytical results in stylized models to develop general insights on the key driving forces and build a decision support model to solve large-scale problems in practice. By applying the model to the case of Pakistan, we provide solutions that outperform common practices in all aspects of energy, irrigation, and flood control.

Although uncertainty has been an important issue in the reward-based crowdfunding literature, there is limited research on how backers respond to probabilistic uncertain rewards. This study examines how backers respond to the lottery-a type of uncertain reward-and how their motivations may shape their responses to probabilistic uncertain rewards. We hypothesize (1) how backers respond to probabilistic uncertain rewards, (2) how these effects vary over time, and (3) how backer motivations moderate their response to probabilistic uncertain rewards. We empirically test our set of hypotheses using data collected from a reward-based crowdfunding platform in China. First, the results from project-level analysis show that although the lottery does help to attract a higher number of backers on a crowdfunding project, the lottery also reduces the total money raised by the project-and thus the probability of reaching its funding goal. Specifically, although the lottery incentivizes individuals who would otherwise not fund the project to become (small) lottery backers, it also cannibalizes regular prospective rewardees and donors by encouraging them to opt for the (cheaper) lottery option. Second, both the incentivizing and the cannibalizing effects of the lottery are stronger in the earlier stages of a project's fundraising cycle. Third, our individual backer-level analysis shows that the lottery has larger effects on backers with higher prior tendencies to be donors than rewardees. Our study theoretically contributes to three streams of literature-crowdfunding, decision making under uncertainty, and the lottery. From a practical standpoint, our study informs (1) fundraisers on how to design strategies to attract the right type of backers and (2) crowdfunding platform owners on how to leverage the lottery as a type of uncertain reward in crowdfunding platforms. © 2020 INFORMS","Crowdfunding; Lottery; Probabilistic rewards; Reward-based crowdfunding platforms; Uncertainty","Decision making; Motivation; Decision making under uncertainty; Design strategies; Project levels; Small investments; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104475025

The key feature in the model is a hold-up friction in the creation of new capital. Innovators generate ideas but are inefficient at implementing them into productive capital on their own. Firms can help innovators implement their ideas efficiently but cannot ex ante commit to compensating them appropriately. Rather, firms are disciplined only by the value of their reputations—the present value of their future partnerships. We model trust as a public signal and construct a correlated equilibrium. When trust is high, firms anticipate fruitful collaborations and thus can credibly commit to not expropriating inventors, leading to the more efficient production of new capital.

In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to quantify the operational impact of offering callbacks under a variety of callback policies. To achieve this goal, we formulate a structural model of the caller decision-making process under a callback option and impute their underlying preferences from data. Our model estimates shed light on caller preferences under a callback option. We find that callers experience three to six times less discomfort per unit of time while waiting for callbacks than while waiting in queue, suggesting that offering callbacks can increase service quality by channeling callers to an alternative service channel where they experience less discomfort while waiting. However, after controlling for expected waiting times, callers generally prefer waiting in a queue over accepting a callback and waiting offline. This suggests that managers of this call center may want to spend efforts in educating their customers on the benefits of the callback option. Using the callers’ imputed preferences, we are able to conduct counterfactual analyses of how various callback policies affect the performance of this call center. We find that in this call center, offering to hold the callers’ spot in line or to call back within a window (guaranteed timeframe) reduces average online waiting time (the average time callers wait on the phone) by up to 71% and improves service quality by decreasing callers’ average incurred waiting cost by up to 46%. Moreover, we find that offering callbacks as a demand postponement strategy during periods of temporary congestion reduces average online waiting time by up to 86%, increases service quality by up to 54%, and increases system throughput by up to 2.1%.

Chemical elements are the building blocks of natural resources which are sourced from across the planet to manufacture globally traded goods. While global technological, social and economic progress accelerates, evaluating the sustainability of these building blocks remains a challenge. Numerous methodologies to evaluate sustainability exist but most rely on high levels of data collection. In this paper, a methodology is presented within a multi-criteria decision analysis and composite indicator framework with the aim of rapidly and comprehensively estimating the sustainability of a chemical element. The framework is based on triple bottom line principles; the environment, economy and society, to measure the sustainability of 59 chemical elements. The output, the chemical element sustainability index (CESI), is a single value supported by the aggregation of the Human Development Index, Global Warming Potential, and National Economic Importance indicators, derived through a rigorous and systematic selection process. Recycling rate is employed within the framework as a control variable given its importance as a sustainability strategy. The results show that the greater the Human Development Index, National Economic Importance and Recycling Rate, and the lower the Global Warming Potential, the more sustainable the chemical element is, and vice-versa. The CESI was validated using three representative piezoelectric materials as a case study. The framework presented is useful for product designers, policy makers and educational bodies, to support decision making towards sustainable production and consumption. © 2020","Chemical element sustainability index; Composite indicator; Principal component analysis; Sustainable development; Triple bottom line","Chemical analysis; Chemical elements; Decision making; Global warming; Indicators (chemical); Ores; Recycling; Composite indicators; Economic importance; Global warming potential; Human development index; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Sustainability index; Sustainability strategies; Sustainable production; Sustainable development; consumption behavior; mineral deposit; ore deposit; principal component analysis; resource management; sustainable development; trade flow; article; controlled study; greenhouse effect; human; human development; multicriteria decision analysis; principal component analysis; recycling; sustainable development; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097772666

In order to handle aircraft and passenger recovery problems simultaneously, we work on integrated networks at which aircraft routings and passenger itineraries are superimposed. Consequently, we could calculate the actual profit and cancellation cost by evaluating each passenger itinerary while considering the seat capacity limitations.

The authors conducted a survey study to collect data from 169 automotive tier 1 suppliers and performed regression analysis to empirically test the hypotheses. Findings: The test results suggest that interorganizational task interdependence among tier 2 suppliers can promote interorganizational promotion-oriented information sharing and interorganizational joint decision making among these suppliers. These improvements can ultimately improve supplier’s NPD product performance. However, the buyer’s requirements uncertainty can reduce the positive effects of such an interdependence arrangement.

The aims of this Delphi study were to project which technologies will be most prevalent in dementia care in five years, articulate potential benefits and risks, and identify specific options to mitigate risks. Participants were also asked to identify technologies that are most likely to cause value tensions and thus most warrant a conversation with an older person with mild dementia when families are deciding about their use. Twenty-one interdisciplinary domain experts from academia and industry in aging and technology in the U.S. and Canada participated in a two-round online survey using the Delphi approach with an 84% response rate and no attrition between rounds. Rankings were analyzed using frequency counts and written-in responses were thematically analyzed. Twelve technology categories were identified along with a detailed list of risks and benefits for each. Suggestions to mitigate the most commonly raised risks are categorized as follows: intervene during design, make specific technical choices, build in choice and control, require data transparency, place restrictions on data use and ensure security, enable informed consent, and proactively educate users. This study provides information that is needed to navigate person-centered technology use in dementia care.

Although existing research has focused on the short-term financial gains that motivate firms to obfuscate, reputational concerns may at least partially counteract these incentives if consumers punish deceptive firms via loss of loyalty in future transactions and/or publicly observable negative feedback. This paper addresses the latter possibility, exploring the impact of mandatory shrouded surcharges on firm reputation in the U.S. hotel industry. Using data collected from two major online travel sites, I exploit differences in surcharge disclosure across booking channels to identify the causal effect of hidden “resort fees” on traveler ratings. I find that hidden fees decrease ratings by roughly 0.15 points (on a rating scale ranging from 1 to 5). The magnitude of this effect varies based on firm characteristics, and this variation is consistent with observed heterogeneity in resort fee adoption patterns: when the expected punishment is more severe, firms are substantially less likely to adopt shrouded surcharges. Results shed light on the extent to which reputational mechanisms may act as a check against price obfuscation and other similar practices intended to exploit boundedly rational consumers. © 2020 INFORMS.","Online feedback; Price obfuscation; Reputation mechanisms","Management; Operations research; Adoption patterns; Financial gains; Hotel industry; Rating scale; Short term; Travel sites; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101052491

Current mapping approaches however may present coarse spatial resolutions, and often fail to consider how UES flows serve resident demand at the appropriate micro-scale. In addition, prohibitive costs involved in collecting primary data to validate UES model parameters to local conditions may enforce the use of proxy methods, thereby inferring ambiguity in parameterisation and uncertainty in mapping outputs. This study examines both issues through the implementation of a high-spatial resolution approach to map multiple urban regulating ecosystem service (temperature regulation, stormwater absorption, and carbon storage) deprivation in Manchester, UK. Poorly performing UES areas are defined as the lowest 10% combined ecosystem service indicator values (‘coldspots’) at 100m grid resolution. Coldspots are compared to population demand levels, disaggregated from weighted population estimates, indicating neighbourhoods deprived of UES. Ambiguity in proxy method implementation is examined using combinations of UES parameter settings (n = 16) within various demand measures (n = 3) to measure changes in relationships between UES, and variation in final map outputs across the study area. Uncertainty is therefore quantified as an interactive process, whereby input parameter ambiguity affects local uncertainty in map outputs, due to varying landcover composition. As explicit sensitivity analysis in current UES mapping studies is limited, the study demonstrates how ambiguity in method parameterisation may impact UES mapping exercises.

These stress factors have resulted in significant fines being issued by the financial regulator Ofwat (>£6 million to UK water utilities in 2018). In addition, Ofwat's Price Review 2019 identified that UK water companies are struggling to secure the long-term resilience of their assets. In response, this research presents a simple visual methodology for characterising, both the process stress and resilience in discrete wastewater treatment processes which can be communicated simply to plant and operational management staff. Initially, the study focusses on the conceptual modelling of process stress and resilience, before moving on to how they can be de-coupled to characterise dynamic resilience. A six-step process stress evaluation methodology is presented, where; (1) is the selection of an existing process model; (2) is data entry and includes benchmarking of existing processes; (3) is the iteration of the process model using Monte-Carlo simulations; (4) is the computation of benchmark variation; (5) is the scaling of variance, with scalar values of −1 to 0 representing process stress and 0 to 1 resilience and, (6) is the visualisation of the variance from a benchmarked condition using contour plots. The outputs of the six-step modelling process are then used to compute the probability of process failure, reliability and estimation of process stability. All the parameters are then used to identify process related failure conditions; with process stress, and resilience being visualised in a contour plot heat map. These visualisations of process stress and resilience presented here, provide a conceptual methodology that allows plant and operational managers to discretely evaluate the stress, and resilience of their wastewater treatment processes. Also, as water chemistry monitoring instrumentation for wastewater treatment processes becomes more reliable, the methodology could be adapted to provide real-time process stress visualisations for both, wastewater and chemical processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmark; Primary sedimentation; Process stability; Reliability; Resilience; Wastewater process stress analysis","Climate change; Human resource management; Investments; Iterative methods; Monte Carlo methods; Reclamation; Sewage treatment plants; Visualization; Conceptual modelling; Estimation of process; Failure conditions; Operational management; Process equipments; Stress evaluations; Wastewater infrastructure; Wastewater treatment process; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094817614

In this paper, we seek to demystify why such puzzling phenomena occur and discourse how firms can better manage their supplier relationships. We argue that any set of dualistic outcomes is basically two manifestations of the same thing—what we refer to as a supplier's learned behavioral pattern. Depending on the buyer's specific relationship strategy, the supplier would learn to behave in a certain way, as it faces two separate—and often competing—business environments: the focal dyad and its extended ties. Adopting the embeddedness lens, we theorize buyer-supplier dyadic embeddedness (BSE) to ascertain the primary (intended) and incidental (unintended) outcomes of buyer strategies toward suppliers. We conceptualize BSE in social and economic dimensions and develop four basic BSE states, dividing each dimension into low and high. Then, we identify four archetypal supplier relationship strategies that correspond with the four basic BSE states and the outcome duality for each strategy type: stability strategy (high social-high economic BSE) inducing relational stability and supplier rigidity, exploitation strategy (low social-high economic) inducing lack of synergy and supplier opportunism, leverage strategy (low social-low economic) inducing relational ambiguity and supplier flexibility, and laissez-faire strategy (high social-low economic) inducing lack of control and supplier innovation. We model each outcome duality mechanism on seemingly unrelated regression (SUR).

The purpose of these investments has been to advance scientific progress in the supported scientific disciplines such as biodiversity and ecological research. However, there is scare research on how these CI investments impact scientific progress. We conducted a longitudinal case study of CI development and scientific progress based on the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program in the United States. We contribute to filling in the research gap by finding CI investments result in impacts both internal and external to the particular discipline of biodiversity. We also find a feedback effect from the discipline to CI development, such that the science and its supporting CI coevolve. The coevolution of CI development and the scientific discipline hinges on the “linking-pin” of data infrastructure. The large-scale data sharing within the discipline and across disciplines, in turn, is contingent on CI governance and how data are structured. The identification of the synergistic coevolution of CI and science enriches coevolutionary theories as well as CI development research. Accordingly, further research and policy changes relating to why and how to fund CI development for sciences, are necessary. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coevolution; Cyberinfrastructure; Data sharing; Longitudinal case study; Scientific discipline","Biodiversity; Data Sharing; Ecology; Cyber infrastructures; Data infrastructure; Feedback effects; Large scale data; Long-term ecological research; Longitudinal case study; Scientific discipline; Scientific progress; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090483672

This paper uses a rich dataset of foreign researchers at a leading German research institution to study the drivers of their innovation productivity (measured by patents and invention disclosures). Another contribution is that we examine the relative effectiveness of internal (institution-specific) and external human capital. These findings are compared to the behavior of native researchers. Results, based on a survey sample of nearly 1000 foreign researchers and taking account of the interdependence between invention disclosures and patenting, show that internal administrative leadership positions (especially group leaders) enhanced propensities to innovate, while purely academic positions (professor or guest researcher) did not positively impact innovation. With regard to external human capital, foreign researchers who were business owners or nascent entrepreneurs were more likely to innovate. Internal (institutional) experience mattered more than industry experience. Doctoral degrees seemed relatively more effective for patenting than for invention disclosures. No significant gender differences in innovation productivity were found. In contrast, while many of the influences were similar for domestic researchers, they experienced positive innovation spillovers from being directors, but domestic female researchers faced special innovation challenges. Finally, domestic professors, unlike foreign professors, did not experience negative tendencies towards innovation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Business owner; Director; Foreign researchers; Germany; Guest researcher; Human capital; Invention disclosures; Nascent entrepreneur; Patents; Professor","Patents and inventions; Personnel; Productivity; Business owners; Director; Foreign researchers; Germany; Guest researcher; Human capitals; Nascent entrepreneurs; Patents; Professor; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076531161

Design/methodology/approach: A pre-test and a between-subjects experimental study test the effect of accurate or biased perceptions of causal attributions on salespeople’s job satisfaction. Data collected from 209 salespeople provide evidence that they make perceptual attribution errors in their appraisals of the performance outcome they achieve or do not achieve. Findings: When salespeople correctly attribute their performance, causal stability affects their job satisfaction. However, company-related attributions affect their satisfaction only in the case of a poor performance outcome. As expected, salespeople who make biased attributions experience misattributed or “unwarranted” satisfaction or dissatisfaction, a higher or lower satisfaction level than they would have experienced had they made proper causal attributions. Research limitations/implications: Using Weiner’s theory of emotion and motivation as a theoretical framework, this study confirms that cognitive appraisals of event outcomes (in this case performance reviews) impacts salespeople’s emotional experience. Furthermore, causal ascriptions following the salesperson’s performance appraisal affect job satisfaction. Practical implications: This study discusses how managers can ensure the continued satisfaction of their salespeople, which constitutes a stable source of motivation, by understanding their performance attributions. Originality/value: This study introduces a new concept of misattributed job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. While anecdotally some scholars have investigated when salespeople play “the blame game”, this study shows how salespeople correctly or incorrectly ascribe blame for the outcomes and the impact on job satisfaction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Causal attribution; Causal stability; Company-related attribution; Experimental study; Job satisfaction; Sales; Sales force; Sales force management; Sales performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091286309

Previous studies have shown a negative relationship between quality and productivity in services. However, we argue the two can be positively related when innovation is present. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops and tests hypotheses using secondary data from COMPUSTAT, KLD STAT and the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). We test these hypotheses using ordinary least squares regression and conduct additional testing using path analysis. Findings: The findings show that quality and productivity are positively related when innovation is present in pure service companies. The findings also reveal find that innovation is antecedent to both service quality and productivity which in turn positively affect customer satisfaction. Practical implications: Both companies and customers can increase their outcomes including higher levels of service quality, productivity and customer satisfaction. Managers should therefore design innovative systems that enable customers to participate in service production. Other innovative systems may help to increase capacity utilization by smoothing high and low demand times, thus increasing both service quality and productivity. Originality/value: This study contributes to service research by identifying innovation as the key to simultaneously increasing service quality and productivity.

Predicting hospital Length of Stay (LOS) is a complex and ill-structured problem, driven by many factors such as a patient’s individual characteristics, treatment plans, and disease-interactions. In this paper, we develop a novel model to predict the expected LOS at the time of admission by combining network science and deep learning. We propose a two-dimensional construct of latent comorbidities comprising historical and probable comorbidities that a patient does not currently manifest but could likely develop during the course of hospital stay. The probable comorbidities are derived from a network comprising relationships among diseases observed in 3.2 million patient records in hundreds of US hospitals. We employ this construct of latent comorbidities in deep learning models to predict patients’ LOS using almost 10 million other patient visits belonging to various disease categories. Implementing these models and analyses required a high-performance computing (Big Data) facility. The average mean absolute percent error of our models across all categories of diseases was 29.8%, which is the best in the current state-of-the-art.

Chichester Harbour, an estuarine complex on the South coast of the UK, is used as a case study area in this paper. Saltmarsh habitat there has declined by 60.6% from 1946 to 2018. This downward trend is predicted to continue. Extrapolated from historic habitat loss, three future saltmarsh habitat area scenarios (worst-case, average loss, best-case) are used to estimate the net carbon sequestered by saltmarsh from 2018 to 2030. Only the best-case scenario predicts a positive net carbon sequestration. Two representative carbon prices (UK policy abatement cost, and the social cost of carbon) are applied to estimate the value of the net carbon sequestered. Discount rates of 2.3% and 3.5% are also applied. Average loss scenario values range from −£2,221,358.99 ± 627,655.96 (abatement cost and a 2.3% discount rate) to −£986,303.19 ± 278,684.84 (social cost of carbon and a 3.5% discount rate).

We argue that ICT shapes the influence of culture dimensions on national innovation in nuanced ways, depending on the nature of the dimensions. In particular, cultural dimensions that pertain to norms, formality, and structure (e.g., power distance and uncertainty avoidance) are often considered detrimental to innovation, whereas culture dimensions that pertain to the pursuit of goals and achievement (e.g., individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation) are often considered conducive for innovation. We hypothesize that ICT amplifies the positive effects of individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation on national innovation—and, attenuates the negative effects of power distance and uncertainty avoidance on national innovation. Our analyses of data on 66 countries from 2007 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses about ICT amplifying the positive effects of individualism and long-term orientation, as well as our hypotheses about ICT attenuating the negative effects of power distance and uncertainty avoidance on national innovation. The findings suggest that ICT amplifies the effects of culture dimensions related to the pursuit of goals and helps overcome barriers to innovation that arise from a culture’s focus on norms, formality, and structure. In turn, these findings can help managers and policy makers to make judicious decisions regarding ICT investments to transcend or leverage the country’s cultural characteristics for innovation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","country-level study; cultural dimensions; GLOBE; ICT; information technology investment; innovation; national culture; National innovation; patents; World Values Survey","Economics; Barriers to innovations; Cultural dimensions; ICT investment; Information and Communication Technologies; Long-term orientation; National innovations; Power distances; Uncertainty avoidance; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103828200

Design/methodology/approach: A time-lag effect is taken into account when examining the proposed model. Data are collected from the Annual Industrial Survey of the National Bureau of Statistics of China. A dataset containing 117,340 firms across the sample period (2001–2007) are used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that while R&D investment plays a significant role in strengthening the positive effect of export activity on a firm's productivity, foreign ownership surprisingly has a negative moderating role. Originality/value: Scholarly interest in the links between export activity and productivity is on the rise. However, the bulk of research has been focused on understanding the effects of export activity on productivity at the country or industry level. Little has been done at the firm level. Another gap in the literature is that the mechanism through which the impact of export activity can be leveraged to enhance the firm's productivity has been largely ignored. To address these issues, the study adopts the learning-by-exporting theory to examine the relationship between export and productivity at the firm-level and how R&D investment and foreign ownership may explain how learning can be leveraged to enhance the firm's productivity. Finally, these relationships are examined in the context of firms from an emerging market, China, which is especially relevant for the learning-by-exporting argument used in this study. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Export; Foreign ownership; Panel data; Productivity; R&D investment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102499143

In this paper, we propose a new model named fixed effects modal regression for panel data in which we model how the conditional mode of the response variable depends on the covariates and employ a kernel-based objective function to simplify the computation. The proposed modal regression can complement the mean and quantile regressions and provide better central tendency measure and prediction performance when the data are skewed. We present a linear dummy modal regression method and a pseudo-demodeing two-step method to estimate the proposed modal regression. The computations can be easily implemented using a modified modal–expectation–maximization algorithm. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the modal estimators under some mild regularity conditions when the number of individuals, N, and the number of time periods, T, go to infinity. The optimal bandwidths with order (NT) - 1 / 7 are obtained by minimizing the asymptotic weighted mean squared errors. Monte Carlo simulations and two real data analyses of a public capital productivity study and a carbon dioxide emissions study are presented to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the newly proposed modal regression. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Asymptotic property; Fixed effects; MEM algorithm; Modal regression; Panel data; Pseudo-demodeing","algorithm; capital formation; carbon emission; computer simulation; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; panel data; performance assessment; prediction; regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099079453

The results show that technological progress is the main driver of CATFP growth in the region and there is no absolute convergence, that is CATFP gaps across countries will not decrease over time and least performing countries will not grow faster than better performing ones without targeted policies. However, CATFP across LAC exhibits conditional convergence towards different steady states.

This is especially true for surface water given its fluid, fungible, and stochastic nature. Two quantifications have emerged: The prior appropriation doctrine provides absolute quantities to water allocated based on first use while proportional water rights distribute a set percentage of total water to owners. While theoretical differences have been identified, empirical tests are scarce due to the endogenous choice of water rights. I identify and utilize a natural experiment where acequias (Hispanic-rooted irrigation ditches) developed in Territorial New Mexico are later divided by the formation of Colorado, exogenously compelling that subset to be subject to the priority system while those in New Mexico continue to practice proportional division. Drawing on a broad compilation of archival, administrative, satellite, hydrological, and survey data, I find priority rights curtail investment for later irrigators, but that the marginal product of water is generally lower under that right system.

Pi-C is an analytical platform that allows stakeholders and decision makers to measure the current health trajectory of the construction industry by gauging increased or decreased trends in five dimensions: (1) economy, (2) stability, (3) social, (4) development, and (5) quality. Pi-C is expected to be developed and extended to a reliable construction index by adding new metrics and dimensions. As such, this research proposes a verification and validation framework of Pi-C to evaluate (1) the stability of the structure, and (2) the connectedness of the network to deal with the missing metrics and the unbalanced structure of Pi-C. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to validate the hierarchical structure and the network of Pi-C. The implementation of the proposed framework was conducted by adding a new metric, supply, under the economy dimension. As a result, it was revealed that adding supply was acceptable, supported by quantitative analysis, and provided the balanced Pi-C structure.

The product only offered by the traditional retailer is labelled as the differentiated product, while the product supplied by both the traditional retailer and the third-party suppliers is called the common product. As the online retailer' common product competes directly with the differentiated product, whether the traditional retailer should supply the common product becomes sophisticated. In this paper, we identify an intrinsic rationale for the traditional retailer not to supply the common product, even if he is unambiguously cost advantageous vis-a-vis the third-party suppliers. This is because the online retailer's order serves as a commitment device that puts the traditional retailer at the disadvantageous follower's position in the differentiated and common products competition; moreover, this quantity commitment allows the online retailer to clinch a better bargaining position on the differentiated product. We further show that it never pays the online retailer to split orders between the traditional retailer and the third-party suppliers.

The research results indicate that trust-, reciprocity-, market-, and contract-based KGMs have positive effects on product quality, efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, and process quality of AFSC. Furthermore, market-based KGM, located in the lowest level in the TISM hierarchy, should be given additional focus due to its role as a key force driving the higher level of AFSC performance and other KGMs. The findings provide AFSC practitioners with useful guidance on how the relationships between KGMs and AFSC performance should be managed to improve the performance of AFSC. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agri-food supply chain; Knowledge governance mechanisms; supply chain performance; total interpretive structural modelling","Commerce; Food supply; Supply chains; Agri-food industry; Agri-food supply chains; Complex structure; Knowledge governance; Mixed-methods research; Semi structured interviews; Structural modelling; Supply chain performance; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089902849

These changes cause environmental turbulence for supply chain entities operating in this sector. In the Greek ASC, there is a significant decline in its performance in particular at producers’ level. Based on the Contingency Theory this paper aims to identify the relevant environmental turbulence factors in Greek ASC context from the producers’ perspective and ascertain their impact on producers based on their choice of buyer type i.e. collaboration type. Twenty in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with Greek ASC producers. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interviews. The findings suggest the existence of six major environmental turbulence factors at producers’ level which are: regulatory, market, competitive, weather, economic and political turbulence factors. Producers selling their products to cooperatives were found to be significantly impacted by the different environmental turbulence factors.

Consumers are clustered into groups based on descriptive variables, consumer desire to outfit matching and customer relationship dimensions. According to the results of this research, female customers with the age 30 or younger, who have a bachelor degree and are single, are inspired to outfit matching and prefer customer involvement dimensions. Also, long-term partnership is the most significant dimensions of CRM for consumers who do not engage in outfit matching. Then, association rules were applied for extracting customer buying behaviour that influence customer tendency to outfit matching. These results can be useful for the fashion industry to apply more effective CRM systems and customise them with customer's preferences and behaviour analysis.

The objective is to maximize the profits of the agents/retailers while minimizing waste and improving customers’ shopping experience. To approach the problem, we develop a discrete-event simulation model to determine the optimum inventory scheme for displaying perishables. The proposed simulation model can show sales trajectories with respect to various features and estimate profit curves.

This paper proposes an optimisation model to identify the set of arcs that, when lost, results in the worst congestion under user equilibrium traffic. The model is formulated as a bi-level non-linear problem. The challenging formulation is solved via a customised version of Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic.

We refute common arguments for legalizing insider trading, including arguments that insider trading is a victimless crime and that the practice promotes efficiency. We explain why insider trading constitutes the moral wrong of cheating, grounding our theory in the legitimate expectations of market participants. Having considered Kantian deontology in other work, we find that virtue ethics theory offers a helpful albeit rough framework for assessing the morality of insider trading independent of its legality. We also find that social contract theories, with norms of equality of opportunity and moral desert, provide a compelling ethical basis for retaining, clarifying and broadening current legal prohibitions against insider trading. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cheating; Eavesdropper; Efficiency; Fairness; Insider trading; Nonpublic information; SEC Rule 10b-5; Social contract theory; Tippee; Tipper; Utilitarianism; Virtue ethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068111903

Analyzing these publicly available data to measure brand health has attracted great research attention. In this study, we focus on developing a method to measure brand favorability while accounting for the measure biases exhibited by social media posters. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic graphical model–based collective inference framework and implement a block-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique to obtain an adjusted brand favorability measure that is correlated with traditional survey-based measures used by brands. For analysis, we collect and examine Facebook data for more than 3,300 brands and about 205 million unique users that interact with those brands via their Facebook brand pages. Our data set is large and contains 6.68 billion likes and full text for 1.01 billion user comments, creating challenges for any modeling efforts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via out-of-sample prediction, external ground truth testing, and simulation. All demonstrate that our model performs very well, providing brand managers with a new method to more accurately measure consumer opinions toward the brand using social media data. © 2021 INFORMS","block-based MCMC; brand measurement; large scale; probabilistic model; social media","Managers; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Social networking (online); User profile; Block based; Block-based MCMC; Brand managers; Brand measurement; Consumer survey; Facebook; Large-scales; Probabilistic models; Social media; Social media datum; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134715773

We consider settings with no announcements and announcements of different accuracy levels. We face two key challenges: (1) we do not observe the reference points customers use in our data, as any other field studies, and (2) it is difficult to separate the reference-dependent behavior from the potential nonlinear waiting cost of customers. To address these challenges, we develop a dynamic decision model with consumer learning, through which we infer the reference point each customer used during any given call. The reference points may be different across different customers and evolve across different calls of the same customers. We also exclude the alternative explanation by showing that our main reference-dependent models better explain the observed customer abandonment than models where customers have nonlinear waiting cost. Our results indicate that customers are loss averse regardless of the availability or accuracy of the announcements when their waiting time is relatively long (≥ 90s). Although delay announcements do not alter the nature that customers are loss averse, accurate announcements may affect customers' belief about the offered waiting time and thus, impact the reference points. Through counterfactual studies, we demonstrate that providing delay announcements improves the call center performance given the loss aversion behavior observed in our data. Interestingly, as customers become more loss averse, the value of providing delay announcements decreases. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

A growing theoretical literature predicts that aspirations both “too close” and “too far” away from current standards lead to less investment in the future. These theories imply an inverted U-shaped relationship between the aspirations gap and investments. I test this hypothesis and extend existing empirical findings to rural Myanmar by examining the relationship between the income aspirations gap and real estate investment choices. I find that income aspirations that are ahead, but not too far ahead, of current income levels provide the best incentive for investment. Analysis of heterogeneity highlights that this relationship is strongest for those with relatively low income and those who hold fatalistic beliefs.

Based on a multiple wavelet coherence analysis, combined with Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (DCC-GARCH). The uni-directional co-movement is sequential, running from gold to the remaining metals. Silver leads platinum and palladium in returns, and platinum leading palladium. Interestingly, silver and platinum combined contribute to the variability of gold, while gold, silver, and palladium contribute to the variability of platinum, suggesting that some lead-lag relationships are complex and strengthened by multivariate relationships among the metals. The lead-lag dependence is high at medium and long investment horizons and responds to economic, political, and pandemic shocks to the global economy. We find that a wavelet-based dynamic hedging strategy performs better than a conventional hedging strategy.

This research focuses on one of the gig economy platforms, the online peer-to-peer (P2P) short-term rental (STR) platform. We examine how the governmental STR interventions affect the long-term rental (LTR) market. Using the prospect theory and the theory in the economics of regulation, we study the relationship between the STR regulations and the LTR rental prices. We find a nonlinear relationship between the STR regulation and the LTR rental prices through analyzing a constructed panel of monthly LTR and STR data from 15 cities across the United States. The nonlinear relationship between these two indicates that STR regulations only have a short-term impact on the LTR market prices but they cannot effectively contain the negative impacts of STR on the LTR market in the long run. Thus, policy-makers need to find alternative ways to govern the STR businesses.

Two studies, one a review of marketing research syllabi and another a content analysis of online job postings, explore this phenomenon. The results imply that, in contrast to the historical context of marketing research course, most advertised entry-level marketing jobs requiring marketing research skills are not in marketing research firms. Indeed, contemporary marketing research is more likely a function embedded within an array of generalist job duties that also require soft skills and the ability to analyze and present data to upper management. As a result of this research, educators should have a heightened awareness of the following: (a) the disconnect between the marketing research curriculum and current industry needs, (b) the changing role of marketing research as diffused throughout the organization, and (c) the broader set of skills and techniques required of entry-level marketing graduates. As a possible solution to these issues, this research proposes an integrated model whereby instructors can help their students navigate the current landscape by choosing an appropriate pedagogical path to assist students in their career goals. © The Author(s) 2021.","availability of careers; employer needs; market research; oral communication; surveys; written communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114460965

Spot instances have cost advantages, albeit at a trade-off of interruptions that can occur when the user's bid price falls below the spot price. The interruptions are often exacerbated since customers often require resources in bundles. For these reasons, customers might have to wait for a long time before their jobs are completed. In this paper, we propose a behavioral-economic model in the form of time-preference-based bids, wherein users are willing to use and bid for services at other times if the vendor cannot provide the resources at the preferred time. Given such bids, we consider the problem of provisioning for such service requests. We develop a time-preference-based optimization model. Since the optimization model is NP-Hard, we develop rule-based genetic algorithms. We have obtained very encouraging results with respect to standard commercial solver as a benchmark. In turn, our results provide evidence for the viability of our approach for online service-provisioning problems. © 2021","Behavioral-economic model; Binary integer programming; Cloud computing; Genetic algorithms; Spot Market; Time-preference","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; NP-hard; Behavioral economics; Commercial solvers; Computing markets; Differentiated Services; On-line service; Optimization modeling; Service requests; Time preferences; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114373117

Drawing from the long-established research on social pollution, in particular its contemporary ‘pollution-as-harm’ notion, we put forward a claim – and provide evidence – that these harmful effects constitute a new type of digital social pollution, which we name ‘algorithmic pollution’. Words do matter, and by using the term ‘pollution’, not as a metaphor or an analogy, but as a transformative redefinition of the digital harm performed by automated algorithmic decision-making, we seek to make it visible and recognized. By adopting a critical performative perspective, we explain how the execution of automated algorithmic decision-making produces harm and thus performs algorithmic pollution. Recognition of the potential for unintended harmful effects of algorithmic pollution, and their examination as such, leads us to articulate the need for transformative actions to prevent, detect, redress, mitigate and educate about algorithmic harm. These actions, in turn, open up new research challenges for the information systems community. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2021.","algorithmic pollution; critical performative perspective; harmful effects; Societal effects of AI and algorithms; transformative services","Automation; Decision making; Criminal justice; Harmful effects; Research challenges; Social welfare; Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106745671

This hybrid realized variance-based EWMA estimator produces forecasts of the conditional covariance matrix that are statistically more accurate and informative and economically more useful than those produced by the standard EWMA and the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models using only daily returns. The evidence of incremental forecast accuracy and the economic value over the intraday range-based hybrid EWMA estimator is, however, insignificant. Moreover, the hybrid EWMA estimators are less sensitive to the choice of decay factors than the standard EWMA model and thus provide a robust framework to accommodate intradaily information for estimates of daily return volatility while achieving a simplicity and ease of implementation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","conditional covariance matrix; exponentially weighted moving average (EMWA); intraday range; realized volatility","Forecasting; Specifications; Conditional variance; Decay factor; Economic values; Exponentially weighted moving average; Forecast accuracy; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Multivariate exponentially weighted moving averages; Return volatilities; Covariance matrix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104581308

While HEIs’ prominent role in promoting regional economic growth, innovation, and attractiveness receives considerable research attention, most of that attention is paid to aspects of HEIs that are directly related to STEM activity. There are various theories that suggest spillovers from non-STEM activity at HEIs as well, specifically in the arts. This study examines whether spillovers occur for HEIs’ large capital investments in the arts. Specifically, we focus on HEI investments in arts physical infrastructure and whether these investments have any effects on regional-level business activity, including jobs and firms. To analyze HEI spillovers of physical arts infrastructure on regional jobs and firms, we use construction starts data on building projects from Dodge Analytics, Inc. and data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which include administrative data for every college, university, and technical/vocational institution that participates in the federal student financial aid programs. We couple these data with public data on regional-level socioeconomic indicators from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Zip-code Business Patterns data. We employ a quasi-experimental propensity-score matching design in order to control for a host of HEI and regional-level characteristics in examining the impact of infrastructure investments.

Even when the benefits associated with a particular asset can be isolated, they involve a high degree of uncertainty, because their execution is affected by several organizational aspects. The multiple choices necessary for the project development imply different phases and cost schemes, so choosing among these choices has implications for the options available for the project manager once the project has started. Assuming a market environment with scarce information, irreversible investment expenditures, and uncertainty in demand, our paper determines a given implied utilization of the production capacity, that cannot be adjusted later. Facing the indicated environment one major problem arises: defining the optimal implied utilization capable of maximizing the option value of investing. Considering a multi-phase forestry investment project, which comprehends a seed and an expanded investment, complemented with a Kalman filter, our study includes a closed-form solution to estimate the optimal level of implied utilization. This paper provides a structure that estimates the critical values of seed capital forestry investment for technology-based projects, mitigating the risk and scheduling the investment efficiently. It intends to validate a two-phase real options tangible forestry investment model, assuming a seed forestry investment with a reducing effect over the uncertainty management. Thus, by exploring this effect, the model provides the optimal implied utilization and determines the suitable volume of seed capital required to maximize the forestry investment option. It contributes to extending the real options literature by linking forestry investment with implied utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Implied utilization; Information scarcity; Multi-stage investments; Seed capital","Application programs; Commerce; Forestry; Timber; Closed form solutions; Degree of uncertainty; Irreversible investments; Organizational aspects; Project development; Technology based projects; Uncertainty in demand; Uncertainty management; Investments; biomass; forest management; investment; Kalman filter; seed; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087975833

The method proposed in this study is motivated by the approach introduced by Kao (Eur J Oper Res 174(2):1087–1099, 2006) where a pair of two-level mathematical DEA models are converted into linear programming (LP) models to calculate the lower- and upper-bound efficiency scores in the presence of pure ordinal data. We show that the LP model proposed by Kao (2006) for finding the lower-bound efficiency score yields the upper-bound efficiency score.

Millions of people use social network apps to share precious moments with friends and family. Users are often asked to provide personal information such as name, gender, and address when using social networks. However, as the social network data are collected, analyzed, and re-published at a large scale, personal information might be misused by unauthorized third parties and even attackers. Therefore, extensive research has been carried out to protect the data from privacy violations in social networks. The most popular technique is graph perturbation, which modifies the local topological structure of a social network user (a vertex) via various randomization techniques before the social graph data is published. Nevertheless, graph anonymization may affect the usability of the data as random noises are introduced, decreasing user experience. Therefore, a trade-off between privacy protection and data usability must be sought. In this paper, we employ various graph and application utility metrics to investigate this trade-off. More specifically, we conduct an empirical study by implementing five state-of-the-art anonymization algorithms to analyze the graph and application utilities on a Facebook and a Twitter dataset. Our results indicate that most anonymization algorithms can partially or conditionally preserve the graph and application utilities and any single anonymization algorithm may not always perform well on different datasets. Finally, drawing on the reviewed graph anonymization techniques, we provide a brief overview on future research directions and challenges involved therein. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Data anonymization; Data utility; Online social networks","Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Graph algorithms; Perturbation techniques; Topology; User experience; Data anonymization; Data utilities; Future research directions; On-line social networks; Personal information; Privacy preservation; Randomization techniques; Topological structure; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070262818

It relied on case study approach to understand processes and outcomes of CSR investments by sampled mines. The study relied on both primary, secondary, qualitative and quantitative sources of data to triangulate perspectives. The case study explored four dimensions of CSR: how decisions and prioritisation of CSR were made; level of stakeholders’ engagement and participation; appropriateness and viability of performance monitoring and accountability systems of sampled mines on CSR commitments; and outcomes [benefits and costs] to host communities from CSR; and factors underlying associated outcomes. Overall, three common themes emerged, differentiated by adopted CSR model, mine ownership, alignment to national, local development priorities and depth of stakeholders’ engagement. Firstly, dominant narrative by extractives was enthusiastic about CSR and its positive impact on sub-national development. The second viewpoint, predominantly by Local Authority, civil society and community-oriented perspective was sceptical about effects of CSR, mining and reiterated strong concerns about negative impacts. Third perspective was mainly reformist by government entities, dominant political parties and development partners, who deemed optimisation of benefits from extractives as sub-optimal. © 2019","Extractives corporate social responsibility; Extractives sustainability index; North-western Zambia; Sustainable local development","Planning; Sustainable development; Accountability systems; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); In-depth understanding; Local development; National development; North-western Zambia; Performance monitoring; Sustainability index; Economic and social effects; corporate social responsibility; investment; optimization; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sustainability; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069694502

The SSFA allows for isolating the cross-sectional spatial dependence and evaluating the role of intangible factors in influencing an airport's economic performance through the inclusion of the distance matrix and the shared destinations matrix calibrated for different distances. By analysing the statistical differences between the traditional and the spatial model, it is possible to identify the competition effects. This study includes 206 airports at the worldwide level. The results show the existence of the spatial component: we detected a different influence of airports’ efficiency levels according to the geographical distances. This could have not been captured by the traditional SFA. We conclude that when incorporating spatial spillover effects into the airport efficiency analysis, the efficiency dynamics are strongly dependent on the spatial distance among airports. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Airport competition; Efficiency analysis; Major airports; Spatial interaction; Transportation","Airports; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Airport competition; Efficiency analysis; Major airport; Paper analysis; Potential impacts; Spatial dimension; Spatial interaction; Spatial stochastic; Stochastic frontier analysis; Stochastic frontier approaches; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106229227

In automobile maintenance service, traditional painting process scheduling scheme usually only considers the profits of enterprises, ignoring the requirements of customers or other stakeholders. To address this gap and achieve sustainable operations of enterprises in the long term, this paper concentrated on the vehicle scheduling of painting process problem with the concern of the demands of managers, workers, customers, governments and non-government environmental protection organisations. This problem was formulated as a nonlinear 0–1 integer programming model to minimise makespan (MP), total pollutant emissions (TPE) and total customers' perceived dissatisfaction (TCPDS). A genetic algorithm was designed to solve the model, and a practical case using data from both the information system and the survey was performed to test the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. Computational results revealed that the genetic algorithm performed well in terms of validity and stability. Pareto solutions demonstrated that optimising task sequences helped increase customers' perceived satisfaction while improving the makespan of vehicle painting, decreased paint waste, and reduced worker health and safety risks. Some of the increases in the percentage of well-timed customer service reservations were catalysed by the method that combined tiered pricing, related to delivery times, the automobile painting efficiency, which improved customers' perceived satisfaction. This paper also further guides managers to incorporate sustainable development into operations in service-oriented manufacturing enterprises. © 2021 The Authors","Multi-objective programming; Painting scheduling; Pareto solutions; Service-oriented manufacturing; Sustainable operations","Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Customer satisfaction; Environmental protection; Genetic algorithms; Health risks; Human resource management; Information use; Integer programming; Managers; Sales; Scheduling; Solid wastes; Maintenance services; Makespan; Painting scheduling; Pareto solution; Process optimisation; Service oriented manufacturing; Service-oriented manufacturing enterprise; Sustainable operations; Sustainable society; Workers'; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116350428

Specifically, it investigates how and why large-scale desalination operations have been employed to respond to community-based conflict over scarce freshwater resources in mining regions, and with what effect. This question was examined through interviews, focus groups, and participant observation among community members, mining company representatives, and government officials in three case study sites in Chile that have experienced recent conflict over water: regions surrounding the Escondida and Los Pelambres mines, which are both employing desalination to resolve concerns over water, and the Andina mine, which is not. Methods also included interviews and a focus group with national-level stakeholders in the capital, Santiago, and analysis of data on water use in Chile's copper mining industry overall. Findings indicate that a broad range of stakeholders are optimistic about the potential for desalination to reduce conflict over water in mining regions. In practice, the intervention has eased tensions with and brought benefits to highland communities near mining operations, but is likely to displace socioenvironmental harms of mining to coastal regions. Moreover, the addition of seawater supplies to mining operations will not reduce freshwater use overall, but rather, permit an expansion of mining production and its associated local and global impacts. The article concludes that desalination cannot resolve socioenvironmental conflict in mining regions if the underlying political and economic structures that cause the need for them in the first place are not addressed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chile; Climate change; Conflict; Extractive industries; Political ecology; Water desalination","Climate change; Ecology; Economics; Seawater; Water filtration; Water supply; Chile; Conflict; Extractive industry; Focus groups; Large-scales; Local impacts; Mining operations; Over water; Political ecology; Water desalination; Desalination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115923269

This research aims to determine the factors that affect customer satisfaction in cold chain logistics, which helps cold chain logistics enterprises identify the main aspects of the problem. Further, the suggestions are provided for cold chain logistics enterprises to improve customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the text mining approach, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to analyze the information implicit in customer-generated reviews. First, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used to identify the topics that customers focus on. Furthermore, to explore the sentiment polarity of different topics, bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a type of deep learning model, is adopted to quantify the sentiment score. Last, regression analysis is performed to identify the significant factors that affect positive, neutral and negative sentiment. Findings: The results show that eight topics that customer focus are determined, namely, speed, price, cold chain transportation, package, quality, error handling, service staff and logistics information. Among them, speed, price, transportation and product quality significantly affect customer positive sentiment, and error handling and service staff are significant factors affecting customer neutral and negative sentiment, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The data of the customer-generated reviews in this research are in Chinese. In the future, multi-lingual research can be conducted to obtain more comprehensive insights. Originality/value: Prior studies on customer satisfaction in cold chain logistics predominantly used questionnaire method, and the disadvantage of which is that interviewees may fill out the questionnaire arbitrarily, which leads to inaccurate data. For this reason, it is more scientific to discover customer satisfaction from real behavioral data.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors cooperate with a logistics server (G7) and establish a driving grading system by constructing real-time inertial navigation data-enabled indicators for both driving behaviour (times of aggressive speed change and times of lane change) and road smoothness (average speed and average vibration times of the vehicle body). Findings: The developed driving grading system demonstrates highly accurate evaluations in practical use. Data analytics on the constructed indicators prove the significances of both driving behaviour heterogeneity and the road smoothness effect on objective driving grading. The methodologies are validated with real-life tests on different types of vehicles, and are confirmed to be quite effective in practical tests with 95% accuracy according to prior benchmarks. Data analytics based on the grading system validate the hypotheses of the driving fatigue effect, daily traffic periods impact and transition effect. In addition, the authors empirically distinguish the impact strength of external factors (driving time, rainfall and humidity, wind speed, and air quality) on driving performance. Practical implications: This study has good potential for providing objective driving grading as required by the modern logistics industry to improve transparent management efficiency with real-time vehicle data.

Design/methodology/approach: This study developed three LSTM-RNN–based models that predicted the probability of bankruptcy before 1, 2 and 3 years using financial, the construction market and macroeconomic variables as input variables. Then, the impacts of the input variables that affected prediction accuracy in each model were identified by using Shapley value and compared among the three models. This study also investigated the prediction accuracy using variants of input variables grouped sequentially by high-impact ranking. Findings: The results showed that the prediction accuracies were largely impacted by “housing starts” in all models. As the prediction period increased, the effects of macroeconomic variables on prediction accuracy increased, whereas the impact of “return on assets” on prediction accuracy decreased. It also found that the “current ratio” and “debt ratio” significantly influenced the prediction accuracies in all models. Also, the results revealed that similar prediction accuracies could be achieved using only 8, 10, and 10 variables out of a total of 18 variables for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction models, respectively.

In this paper, the authors explore the role of digitalization as a driver of SCI, as well the role of human capital (HC) in digitalization, using a knowledge management (KM) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted using survey research. A sample of 188 omni-channel retailers in the Chinese market was analyzed using factor analysis and structured equation modeling (SEM) to examine the hypotheses presented in the conceptual model. Findings: This study reveals that HC is positively related to the level of a firm's digitalization in OCR, and that digitalization is positively related to the retailer's SCI. Moreover, the authors found that employees' capital has a greater impact on digitalization than managers' capital, while digitalization has a stronger driving effect on internal and customer integration. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that although digitalization requires retailers to accept the long-term investment challenges, it has a significant positive effect on the key of OCR strategy implementation, i.e. SCI. The findings also provide evidence for the application of KM in OCR, as this theoretical lens enriches our understanding of the phenomena of SCI in OCR and provides explanation to our results by linking digitalization and HC.

We study the impact of such distributed renewable energy (DRE) on utility profits and social welfare under net metering, which is a widespread policy in the United States. Utilities have been lobbying against net-metered distributed solar based on the common belief that it harms utility profits. We find that when wholesale market dynamics are considered, net-metered DRE may be a positive for utilities. That is, net-metered DRE strictly improves the expected utility profit when the utility’s self-supply is below a threshold and the wholesale electricity price is sufficiently responsive to wholesale demand fluctuations. Our paper distinctively considers both downstream and upstream impacts of net-metered DRE on utilities and analyzes the tradeoff between these impacts. Net-metered DRE can increase utilities’ expenses because of their required buyback from generating customers, and reduces their retail sales revenues. In addition, it can either reduce utilities’ wholesale procurement costs or affect their wholesale market revenues. Our results suggest that utilities might benefit from emerging business strategies that motivate their customers to install solar panels. Our numerical study uses data on the distributed solar in California and the wholesale electricity market operated by the California Independent System Operator, and demonstrates that our findings hold under realistic parameters.

Although the pooled structure, known to minimize the servers' idle time, is widely used in large-scale service systems, this study reveals that the dedicated structure, along with the join-the-shortest-queue routing policy, could be more advantageous for improving certain performance measures, such as the probability of a customer's waiting time being within a delay target. The servers' additional idleness resulting from the dedicated structure will be negligible when the system scale is large. Using a fluid model substantiated by asymptotic analysis, we provide a performance comparison between the two structures for a moderately overloaded queueing system with customer abandonment. We intend to help service system designers answer the following question: To reach a specified service-level target, which queue structure will be more cost effective?

Fitting rooms in B&M stores play a critical role in the customer experience as a venue to experience products and examine alternatives. High traffic in fitting rooms, however, obstructs the customer’s ability to choose a product. In this paper, we (1) examine the impact of fitting room traffic on store performance using archival data, (2) identify phantom stockouts as a plausible mechanism for this impact, and (3) provide a potential solution and quantify the magnitude of its impact using two field experiments. Academic/practical relevance: The consumer purchase decision process framework has been widely used in disciplines such as marketing and information systems. We consider the impact of high traffic in fitting rooms on customer’s purchase decision process. We show that high traffic in fitting rooms affects store sales negatively as it can obstruct customers’ ability to perform information search, evaluation of alternatives, or both. Methodology: We use archival data analysis, a field study, and a field experiment to demonstrate our findings. Results: We demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between fitting room traffic and sales using archival data analysis. Our field study reveals that high traffic in fitting rooms exacerbates phantom stockouts, which could contribute to the decline in sales. Finally, through field experiments at two retailers, we show that a timely backend recovery operation through a dedicated fitting room associate reduces phantom stockouts and increases sales by 22.4%–22.7%. Managerial implications: First, contrary to conventional wisdom that traffic drives sales, we identify that fitting room traffic beyond a certain point can hurt store sales. Second, we find a large magnitude of phantom stockouts in fitting rooms. Finally, we show that dedicated fitting room labor can significantly boost store sales by alleviating phantom stockouts. Our proposed solution was adopted by both retail organizations that we worked with. © 2020 INFORMS.","Empirical research; Field experiments; Fitting room traffic; Phantom stockouts; Retail operations","Data handling; Digital storage; Information analysis; Phantoms; Decision process; Empirical research; Field experiment; Field studies; Fitting room traffic; Phantom stockouts; Phantoms; Purchase decision; Retail operations; Stock outs; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120411968

Fulfilling the “hard responsibility” of product quality based on technical standards and the “soft responsibility” of product quality based on business ethics is an important principle stimulating the benign interaction and continuous progress of technological innovation and business ethics, and realizing a balanced development of enterprises and society, which could promote positive brand and enterprise image to both stakeholders and consumers, helping consumers choose high-quality products in the market and social competition. However, the strange marketing phenomena of “salable fake goods” and “unsalable quality goods” shows that no systematic marketing strategies have been identified to date, that enterprises could adopt to effectively promote the recognition of consumers and turn them into a loyal customer group and have a stable market share. Based on customer buying behavior theory, cognitive consistency theory, signal theory, and social identity theory, this study explored the influencing mechanism of quality responsibility on brand loyalty of consumers and the mediating role of corporate reputation and brand identification, using 224 valid questionnaires from 16 communities (residents) in Shanxi and Henan provinces of China tested by SPSS 20.0 and AMOS 25.0. Results show that quality responsibility has a significant positive influence on brand behavior loyalty and brand attitude loyalty, and both corporate emotional reputation and brand identification play mediating roles in the relationship between quality responsibility and brand behavior loyalty, and quality responsibility and brand attitude loyalty. Additionally, corporate cognitive reputation only plays a mediating role in the relationship between quality responsibility and brand behavior loyalty.

Energy efficiency measures (EEMs) have been identified as the best strategy to reduce air pollution and maximize social benefits. However, their adoption has been slow. The objective of this article is to investigate household preferences for financial incentives needed to promote private investments in EEMs in Central-Southern Chilean households and study the role of energy savings and the uncertainty about potential savings in the investment decision, with the aim of finding solutions to increase the adoption of these technologies. We use a choice experiment to explore the trade-off between the investment costs, financial instruments, energy savings, and the uncertainty about achieving the theoretical savings provided by engineering and architectural models. The results show that financial instruments play the most important role in this decision, followed by the savings achieved by the retrofit. Householders prefer to finance their investments with a mix of their personal resources and medium-term credits, trying to avoid long-term commitments. Although uncertainty was found to be a significant variable, it seems to play a small role in the investment decision. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chile; Choice experiments; Energy efficiency; Energy savings; Financial instruments; Retrofits; Uncertainty","Cost engineering; Economic and social effects; Heating; Investments; Pollution; Retrofitting; Chile; Choice experiments; Efficiency measure; Energy savings; Energy transitions; Energy-savings; Financial instrument; Investment decisions; Quality of life; Uncertainty; Energy efficiency; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; experimental study; finance; household energy; incentive; investment; strategic approach; trade-off; uncertainty analysis; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118182956

In this comprehensive paper, we globally review and theoretically unify these two strands of research in studying the record level of bank failures and the deepest financial crisis of an emerging market, Turkey, with sixteen distinct measures of efficiency, stemming from two alternative methods, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The results show that efficiency scores tend to deteriorate gradually before crisis, hit bottom during crisis, and rebound after crisis. Inelastic inputs and elastic outputs seem to produce this pattern. The efficient banks have the highest survival rates. Managers of survivor banks are evidently better at controlling costs and scales, utilizing and allocating resources, generating assets, revenues and profits. Demotion to a lower efficiency class is a rare event in normal times but widespread during crises. The least efficient banks are the least likely to be acquired by private bidders. Default prediction models notably improve with DEA scores, off-balance sheet items, definition of failure with “factual insolvency”, deciles of efficiency, changes in some key variables, homogenous dataset, and efficiency scores based on quantities of inputs and outputs rather than their noisy prices. © 2021","Crisis; DEA; Default; Early warning system; Efficiency; Failure; Financial stability; Probit; SFA; Turkish banks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112537592

The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Sequence mining; Session fingerprinting; Session stitching; Web analytics","Behavioral research; Decision making; Customer analysis; Demographic data; E-commerce context; Embedding technique; Hand held device; Matching algorithm; State of the art; Web navigation; Websites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107374274

Against that tendency, VCs are increasingly investing internationally—but with substantial heterogeneity across firms in extent, location, and success. We propose a mechanism that explains these patterns. The ties VCs form to immigrant entrepreneurs when investing domestically provide access to the knowledge and connections of those immigrants, which facilitates VC investments in the immigrants' homelands. Using data on U.S. VC activity in India, we find that firms invest in more Indian startups as their ties to Indian entrepreneurs in the United States increase—particularly in the Indian region where immigrants originate and when the VC faces heightened domestic competition. Such ties also enhance the odds of successful exit for the VC's Indian investments. Managerial Summary: Why are venture capital (VC) firms increasingly investing in foreign startups, and why do these firms differ in the location and success of such international investments? We demonstrate that the ties to immigrant entrepreneurs VCs establish when investing domestically provide knowledge and connections that enable future VC investments in the immigrants' homelands. Using data on U.S. VC firms, we find that the more ties to Indian immigrant entrepreneurs a firm develops, the more it subsequently invests in Indian startups. This effect is stronger when the VC firm faces heightened domestic competition (a push effect) and in the specific regions of India where the immigrants originate (a pull effect). Domestic ties to Indian immigrants also help U.S. VCs make more successful investments in India. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","entrepreneurship; immigration; internationalization; networks; venture capital","Competition; Domestic competition; International investments; Local networks; Pull effect; Push effect; Venture Capital; Venture capital investments; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105940240

The research directly measures the passengers' perception of perceived quality and value for money of using app-based ride-sharing services in Bangladesh and how it impacts passengers' satisfaction. The study also measures the indirect relationship of perceived quality and value for money and passengers' loyalty through the mediating effects of passenger satisfaction in app-based ride-sharing services. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used an online self-administered survey questionnaire to collect data from the respondents who have experienced app-based ride-sharing services in Bangladesh. In this study, 400 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents online (Google form) and received 281 useful responses that give a 70.25% response rate. The survey data were analyzed based on construct validity, convergent validity and structural equation modeling by using Smart PLS 3. Findings: The research findings indicate that perceived quality and value for money positively and significantly influence passengers' satisfaction. The passengers' satisfaction has a direct and significant relationship with passenger loyalty. The research findings also indicate that perceived quality and value for money have an indirect relationship with passenger loyalty through the mediating effect of passenger loyalty in app-based ride-sharing services. Practical implications: Both perceived quality and value for money have been the key drivers of passenger satisfaction and loyalty. Thus, the ride-sharing service providers should emphasize enhancing passenger value perception and quality service to reinforce passenger satisfaction and loyalty by increasing communication with the passengers about their apps. Besides, the service providers need to keep track of passengers' satisfaction levels and adopt necessary initiatives to ensure satisfied passengers toward loyalty. Originality/value: Limited studies have investigated the impacts of perceived quality and value for money on passenger satisfaction and loyalty to app-based rideshare service. It is a suitable time as the research findings will help ride-sharing service providers enhance their quality performance to compete healthily. Simultaneously, passengers can enjoy improved, and value-added services due to increasing competition among the app-based service providers. Regulators can also emphasize passenger quality services and the importance of money as a proposition while formulating policy and regulations toward the management of ride-sharing companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Passenger loyalty; Passenger satisfaction; Perceived quality; Ride-sharing service; Value for money","Decision support systems; Management; Construct validity; Convergent validity; Design/methodology/approach; Passenger satisfaction; Policy and regulation; Quality performance; Structural equation modeling; Value added service; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099502132

Moreover, the food waste when sent to landfills, decomposes to produce greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide. The emergence of food banks and aggregators has abated the problem of food wastage to a certain extent. An aggregator, which connects the retailers to the food banks, plays a critical role in ensuring that the food reaches the food banks on time. However, to ensure food security and reduce wastage of food, it is essential that food aggregators remain profitable. The aggregator has to determine the number of heterogeneous vehicles to hire from the market and allocate them their route on a daily basis depending on donations committed by the retailers and also take into account potential environmental impact from the decomposition of food waste and carbon emitted from hired vehicles. Hence, we propose decision support for aggregators, using data from an aggregator based in Turkey, which can help in reducing food wastage by allocating the donated food items from retailers to food banks while maximizing the profitability of the aggregator and minimizing the environmental impact. We have also analyzed how the availability of different types of vehicles can impact the aggregator's profit. Furthermore, the effect of various model parameters such as transportation cost, and percentage of retailers' gain paid to the aggregator on the total profit along with the impact of distances on types of vehicles hired is also analyzed. We have compared two strategies that the aggregator could possibly employ and generate managerial insights. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregator; Food supply chain; Logistics; Near-expiry food; Optimal allocation","Carbon dioxide; Decision support systems; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Logistics; Profitability; Sales; Solid wastes; Supply chains; Aggregator; Economic considerations; Food banks; Food security; Food supply chain; Food wastages; Food waste; Near-expiry food; Optimal allocation; Supply networks; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111812691

Design/methodology/approach: The present study is contextualised in the Iranian pistachio export industry. An extensive review of the state-of-the-art literature on supplier collaboration was conducted to identify key capabilities that are essential to establish a collaborative network. The set of defined capabilities were then optimised through interviews with 14 experts from the relevant industry, academics and export authorities. A combination of the fuzzy Delphi method and the best–worst method (BWM) approach was, respectively, used to reduce the number of capability alternatives and assign priority weights to these alternatives. Subsequently, a weighted aggregated sum product assessment method (WASPAS) was employed to rank and evaluate the ability to creating a collaborative network for the export of pistachio. Findings: From the extant literature review, 18 capabilities for the formation of coordination networks in the international markets were identified. Then, the prominent indicators in forming a global network were extracted. After ranking the top pistachio export countries/regions to formalise an efficient collaborative network, it was revealed that although Iran exports approximately 30% of the global market, it falls behind the USA and European Union. The competitors have scored higher in critical criteria, including “trust and commitment”, “strategy and management”, “managerial control and standardization” and “financial resources”. Originality/value: The proposed hybrid approach encompassing fuzzy Delphi–BWM–WASPAS offers to solve the capability evaluation and selection as well as ranking the possible alternative to formalise a collaborative network in an integrated fashion. This combination of methods is capable to first identify the most important factors, then measuring their importance and eventually rank the possible alternatives. The suggested framework provides an approach to deal with the uncertainty of global collaborative network formation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Best–worst method; Export network; Fuzzy Delphi method; Network collaboration; Weighted aggregated sum product assessment","International trade; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Capability evaluations; Collaborative network; Coordination networks; Design/methodology/approach; Financial resources; Fuzzy Delphi Method; International markets; Multi-layer hybrids; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109352291

In an estimated Euro Area New Keynesian model with financial frictions and climate policy, we study the possible perils of a low-carbon transition and evaluate the role of monetary policy and financial regulation. We show that, even for very ambitious climate targets, transition costs are moderate along a timely and gradual mitigation pathway. Inflation volatility strongly increases for disorderly climate policy, demanding a strong monetary response by central banks. In reaction to an adverse financial shock originating in the fossil sector, a green quantitative easing policy can provide an effective stimulus to the economy, but its stabilizing properties do not significantly differ from those of market neutral asset purchase programs. A financial regulation, encouraging the decarbonization of the banks’ balance sheets via ad hoc capital requirements, can significantly reduce the severity of a financial crisis, but prolongs the recovery phase.

The outcomes can be explained by the interplay of two opposing effects of competition: the reputation-building effect, whereby competing firms choose high quality to build a good reputation, and the rent-extraction effect, whereby competition hinders investment for quality improvements by lowering price premia. These observations are consistent with a repeated game model that incorporates public and private-payer segments.

Capturing the full cost benefits of modularized processes requires careful consideration of different aspects related to material, design, technology, logistics, installation, and so forth. Although many previous research efforts provided models to assess the feasibility of modularization in construction projects, no previous study developed a risk-based approach to assess the impact of adopting modular approaches on the cost performance of construction projects. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors followed an interrelated multistep research methodology. First, 50 modular risks were identified based on an extensive analysis of the literature conducted in a previous research study. Second, an industry survey was conducted in which 48 construction professionals - with an average of 24.25 years experience in construction operations and 13.6 years experience in modular construction - examined and assessed the impact of modular risks on cost performance. Third, integrated statistical and mathematical techniques - including distribution fitting - were utilized to develop a predictive model that (1) maps the 50 modular risks under investigation to cost performance data collected from 56 modular construction projects, and, consequently, (2) computes the associated cost saving and/or growth. The proposed model was verified using extreme condition tests, surprise behavior test, and sensitivity analysis, and was validated by industry experts. The authors provide guidelines for using the proposed model by industry practitioners. The developed model allows for maximized use of available project information to enable a reliable a priori cost assessment for the modularization processes throughout the different project phases. This is particularly important in the case of varying conditions over the project lifecycle. The developed model helps project stakeholders identify cost enablers and barriers that are interrelated with modularization processes. Accordingly, corrective actions and mitigation plans can be established. This research provides improved practices for decision-making, risk management, and project team alignment to maximize the cost benefits of modularization in construction projects. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Decision-support tool; Modular risks; Modularization; Proactive risk management","Construction industry; Costs; Decision making; Human resource management; Modular construction; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sensitivity analysis; Construction operations; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Distribution fitting; Project informations; Project stakeholders; Research methodologies; Risk based approaches; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112766026

Despite many countries granting Captive Power Plants (CPPs) access to the grid, integration may still be hindered by other barriers to entry. In Bangladesh, CPPs are required to sell their electricity surplus, but there is no evidence of trading with the national grid, mostly due to high connectivity costs. In this paper we develop and estimate a fit-for-purpose Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to examine the effects of the Bangladeshi CPPs connecting to the national grid and selling their surplus at regulated prices. The model parameters are set through a combination of calibration and Bayesian estimation. We find that if CPPs are connected to the national grid, steady-state industrial output, GDP, and household consumption decrease due to pre-existing energy price distortions. These results support the second-best theory, which implies that merely connecting the CPPs to the national grid without firstly removing market distortions can lead to economically inefficient outcomes. Instead, government should first consider alternative reforms such as phasing out subsidized tariffs and enabling a competitive market environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bangladesh; CPPs; DSGE model; Electricity generation","Bayesian networks; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Power markets; Stochastic models; Bangladesh; Captive power plants; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model; Electricity sector; Electricity-generation; Market access; National Grid; Performance; Power; Resources utilizations; Stochastic systems; Bayesian analysis; calibration; electricity generation; electricity supply; macroeconomics; market system; numerical model; stochasticity; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112507342

In this paper, a random effect eigenvector spatial filtering (RE-ESF) approach without and with non-spatially varying coefficients (SNVC) is identified to examine spatial heterogeneity and economic driving factors of SO2 emissions in China from 2011 to 2017. Using the Moran eigenvectors to extract information on spatial dependence, the main findings of the RE-ESF approach are as follows: First, after comparing different approaches for dealing with spatial dependence, it is found that the RE-ESF approach demonstrates the best fit to the dataset. Second, the global investigation shows that SO2 emissions are negatively determined by economic growth and government expenditure for environment protection, but are positively determined by road freight transport, coal consumption and oil consumption. Third, the local investigation indicates that the spatially varying coefficients of economic growth and coal consumption range from 0.1401 to 0.2732 with the median value of 0.2478 and from 0.2406 to 0.3611 with the median value of 0.3210, respectively, revealing significant spatial heterogeneity of SO2 emissions driven by economic growth and coal consumption. These findings provide meaningful insights into centralized and province-specific policies for reducing SO2 emissions. © 2021","Economic determinants; Environmental sustainability; Non-spatially varying coefficients; Province-specific policies; Spatial dependence","Coal; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Freight transportation; Random processes; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Economic determinant; Economic growths; Environmental sustainability; Non-spatially varying coefficient; Province-specific policy; Random effects; SO$-2$; Spatial dependence; Spatial filterings; Spatial heterogeneity; Economics; economic growth; eigenvalue; emission; government; heterogeneity; spatial analysis; sulfur dioxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111230894

Pre-processing of the data translates to an alteration of the regularization – explicit or implicit – embedded in ML algorithms. We review old transformations and propose new ones, then empirically evaluate their merits in a substantial pseudo-out-sample exercise. It is found that traditional factors should almost always be included as predictors and moving average rotations of the data can provide important gains for various forecasting targets.

In order to summarize and analyze the extent, sources, and consequences of survey error, we define empirical counterparts of key components of the Total Survey Error Framework that can be estimated using data combination. Specifically, we estimate total survey error and decompose it into three high level sources of error: generalized coverage error, item non-response error and measurement error. We further decompose these sources into lower level sources such as failure to report a positive amount and errors in amounts conditional on reporting a positive value. For errors in dollars paid by two large government transfer programs, we use administrative records on the universe of program payments in New York State linked to three major household surveys to estimate the error components previously defined. We find that total survey error is large and varies in its size and composition, but measurement error is always by far the largest source of error. Our application shows that data combination makes it possible to routinely measure total survey error and its components. Our results allow survey producers to assess error reduction strategies and survey users to mitigate the consequences of survey errors or gauge the reliability of their conclusions. © 2020 The Author(s)","Administrative data; Data combination; Linked data; Measurement error; Total survey error","Measurement errors; Data combination; Error components; Error reduction; Household surveys; New York State; Positive value; Response error; Unemployment rates; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098185548

The use of lateral flow serology can provide a clinically convenient approach for the assessment of prior infection with Covid-19. However, its widespread adoption in organisations seeking to use it to test for workforce immunity is controversial and confusing. This paper aims to explore the paradoxical dilemmas and dialectics immunity workforce testing creates. Design/methodology/approach: This study involved capturing the ethnographical participation of a chief executive officer (CEO) dealing with the experience of managing the outcomes of Covid-19 workforce immunity testing. The aim was to take a snapshot in time of the CEO's empirical world, capturing their lived experiences to explore how management actions resulting from Covid-19 immunity testing can played out. Findings: Providing staff with immunity tests at first glance appears sensible, decent and a caring action to take. Nevertheless, once such knowledge is personalised by employees, they can, through dialectic dialogue, feel disadvantaged and harbour feelings of unfairness. Subsequently, this paper suggests that immunity testing may only serve to raise awareness and deepen the original management dilemma of whether testing is a worthwhile activity. Originality/value: This paper aims to be amongst the first works to empirically explore the workforce management challenges that arise within small businesses within the service sector following the completion of Covid-19 immunity testing of their staff. It seeks to achieve this via utilising the robust theoretical framework of the paradox theory to examine Covid-19's impact upon small business workforce management thinking and practice. © 2021, Steven Davies, Gareth Reginald Terrence White, Anthony Samuel and Helen Martin.","Covid-19; Dialectic; Dilemma; Health care; Immunity testing; Lateral flow serology; Leadership; Management; Paradox; Working practices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128380585

Every year millions of child maltreatment incidents are reported to Child Protection Services (CPS) agencies. Experts in child protection face enormous workloads of analyzing reported incidents to assess the victims’ risk of experiencing a reoccurrence of maltreatment in the future. However, the existing systems deployed to help the experts are limited in two aspects: first, most have a limited capability in integrating a large amount of data originating from various entities dealing with child maltreatment; second, they are not adaptable enough to accommodate various degrees of un-structuredness inherent in the knowledge-intensive nature of CPS's tasks, thus relying on CPS and various other experts for system configuration beyond typical users’ skillsets. In response, we propose an adaptive machine learning system (AMLS) inspired by the Routine Activity Theory focused on predicting recurrent child maltreatment.

As an increasing amount of mobility data become available because of the development of location-based technologies, we argue that this resourceful mobility data can be used to improve link prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel link prediction framework that utilizes user offline check-in behavior combined with user online social relations. We model user offline location preference via a probabilistic factor model and represent user social relations using neural network representation learning. To capture the interrelationship of these two sources, we develop an anchor link method to align these two different user latent representations. Furthermore, we employ localitysensitive hashing to project the aggregated user representation into a binary matrix, which not only preserves the data structure but also improves the efficiency of convolutional network learning. By comparing with several baseline methods that solely rely on social networks or mobility data, we show that our unified approach significantly improves the link prediction performance. Summary of Contribution: This paper proposes a novel framework that utilizes both user offline and online behavior for social link prediction by developing several machine learning algorithms, such as probabilistic factor model, neural network embedding, anchor link model, and locality-sensitive hashing. The scope and mission has the following aspects: (1) We develop a data and knowledge modeling approach that demonstrates significant performance improvement.

Recognizing the challenges of user registration, many websites opt to delay their registration request until the end of the conversion funnel (i.e., ex post registration request). Our study explores an alternative approach by asking users to register with the website at the beginning of their shopping journey (i.e., ex ante registration request). Guided by a stylized analytical model, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment in partnership with an online retailer in the United States to examine how the ex ante request affects users' registration decisions, short-term customer conversions, and long-term purchase behaviors. Specifically, we randomly assigned the new users in the website's incoming traffic to one of two experimental groups: one with an ex ante registration request preceding the ex post request (treatment) and the other with only an ex post registration request (control). Our results show that the ex ante request leads to an increased probability of user registration; that is, the users in the treatment group, on average, are 58.08% relatively more likely to register with the website than those in the control group. Furthermore, the ex ante request leads to significant increases in customer purchases in the long run. Based on our estimation of the local average treatment effects, the ex ante registered users are 10.89% relatively more likely to make a purchase, place a 16.76% relatively greater number of orders, and generate 13.22% relatively higher total revenue for the firm in the long run. Finally, the ex ante request also does not impact customer conversion in the short-term. Further investigation into the long-term and short-term effects provides suggestive evidence on several potential mechanisms, such as firm-initiated interaction and screening of low-interest users. Our study provides managerial implications to the e-commerce websites on customer acquisition and contributes to the research on IT artifact design.

We also quantify the resulting value generated by reverse logistics and identify the drivers of that value. Academic/practical relevance: Reverse logistics has been gaining recognition in practice and theory for helping companies better match supply with demand, and thus reduce costs in their supply chains. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of clarity in practice and the research literature regarding precisely what in reverse logistics is so important, exactly how reverse logistics creates value, and what the drivers of that value are. Methodology: We first formulate a multistage inventory model to jointly optimize ordering decisions pertaining to regular, reverse, and expedited flows of product in a logistics supply chain, where the physical transformation of the product is completed at the most upstream location. With multiple product flows, the feasible region for the problem acquires multidimensional boundaries that lead to the curse of dimensionality. Next, we extend our analysis to product-transforming supply chains, in which product transformation is allowed to occur at each location. In such a system, it becomes necessary to keep track of both the location and stage of completion of each unit of inventory; thus, the number of state and decision variables increases with the square of the number of locations. Results: To solve the reverse logistics problem in logistics supply chains, we develop a different solution method that allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the feasible region and identify the structure of the optimal policy. We refer to this policy as a nested echelon base stock policy, as decisions for different product flows are sequentially nested within each other. We show that this policy renders the model analytically and numerically tractable. Our results provide actionable policies for firms to jointly manage the three different product flows in their supply chains and allow us to arrive at insights regarding the main drivers of the value of reverse logistics. One of our key findings is that, when it comes to the value generated by reverse logistics, demand variability (i.e., demand uncertainty across periods) matters more than demand volatility (i.e., demand uncertainty within each period). To analyze product-transforming supply chains, we first identify a policy that provides a lower bound on the total cost. Then, we establish a special decomposition of the objective cost function that allows us to propose a novel heuristic policy. We find that the performance gap of our heuristic policy relative to the lower-bounding policy averages less than 5% across a range of parameters and supply chain lengths. Managerial implications: Researchers can build on our methodology to study more complex reverse logistics settings, as well as tackle other inventory problems with multidimensional boundaries of the feasible region. Our insights can help companies involved in reverse logistics to better manage their orders for products, and better understand the value created by this capability and when (not) to invest in reverse logistics.

Acknowledging the theoretical rationale for both a specialist and a generalist approach to philanthropy, we took a question-driven, abductive approach, and found a robust positive association between philanthropic variety and firm profitability for donations by large US public corporations from 2003 to 2011. This association held for variety across causes but not within causes, for nonlocal giving and for giving by diversified firms, and was weaker for firms whose donations faced greater scrutiny. These findings are consistent with a moral hazard explanation whereby firms take advantage of the relatively inelastic support for philanthropy within a cause area by strategically spreading their donations across a wide range of supporter interests, thus maximizing profits. Managerial Summary: Do firms earn higher profits if they spread their philanthropic donations across many different causes, or if they concentrate them among a few? Examining donations by large US public corporations we found that firms earned higher returns when they gave to many different causes, holding the total amount of donations constant; that this relationship was primarily true for nonlocal giving and giving by multinational and multi-business firms, and was weaker for firms under shareholder scrutiny or those that gave inconsistently over time. Our best explanation for these results is that supporters of corporate philanthropy care more about whether a firm gives to a cause than how much it gives, making it optimal for firms to give minimal amounts to a large variety of causes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","abductive approach; corporate philanthropy; market for social goods; moral hazard; strategic CSR","Risk management; Corporate philanthropies; Firm profitabilities; Moral hazard; Nonlocal; Public corporations; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107844182

After that, “make” becomes a superior choice. We then demonstrate that the “buy-to-make” sourcing sequence is associated with superior technological and financial performances in the postdominant design phase of the architectural innovation period, as well as with greater firm survival during the market shakeout in the later period of modular standardization.

However, the theory is mainly developed assuming that the model is stationary with time invariant parameters. This is at odds with the prevalent evidence for parameter instability in economic time series, but theories for parameter instability are mainly developed for models with a small number of covariates. In this paper, we present two L2 boosting algorithms for estimating high dimensional models in which the coefficients are modeled as functions evolving smoothly over time and the predictors are locally stationary. The first method uses componentwise local constant estimators as base learner, while the second relies on componentwise local linear estimators. We establish consistency of both methods, and address the practical issues of choosing the bandwidth for the base learners and the number of boosting iterations. In an extensive application to macroeconomic forecasting with many potential predictors, we find that the benefits to modeling time variation are substantial and they increase with the forecast horizon. Furthermore, the timing of the benefits suggests that the Great Moderation is associated with substantial instability in the conditional mean of various economic series. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; L2 boosting; Locally stationary; Parameter instability; Sparsity","Economics; Mathematical techniques; Boosting algorithm; Economic time series; Great moderations; High-dimensional models; Local linear estimator; Macroeconomic forecasting; Parameter instability; Time varying parameter; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090490283

The two formulas express the marginal density as a convolution with suitable Gaussian kernels whose variances are related to the conditional moments of price returns. Via asymptotic expansion of the non-Gaussian function in the convolutions, we derive explicit formulas for European-style option prices and implied volatility. The European option prices can be expressed as Black–Scholes style terms plus corrections at higher orders in the volatilities of volatilities, given by the Black–Scholes Greeks. The explicit formula for the implied volatility clearly identifies the effect of the higher moments of the price on the implied volatility surface. Further, we derive the relationship between the VIX index and the variances of the two Gaussian kernels. As a byproduct, we provide an explanation of the bias between the VIX and the volatility of total returns, which offers support to recently proposed methods to compute the variance risk premium. Via a series of numerical exercises, we analyse the accuracy of our pricing formula under different parameter settings for the one- and two-factor models applied to index options on the S&P500 and show that our approximation substantially reduces the computational time compared to that of alternative closed-form solution methods. In addition, we propose a simple approach to calibrate the parameters of the multi-factor Heston model based on the VIX index, and we apply the approach to the double and triple Heston models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Finance; Option pricing; Stochastic volatility models; Variance risk premium","Convolution; Economic and social effects; Economics; Financial markets; Gaussian distribution; Numerical methods; Asymptotic expansion; Closed form solutions; Computational time; Conditional moments; Implied volatility; Marginal densities; Marginal probability; Variance risk premiums; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098194980

In this paper, the newsvendor model is developed considering all sustainability criteria to study a two-stage procurement system. The classic newsvendor model of optimizing supplier-retailer payoff is considered in this research to illustrate the economic perspective of sustainability. Moreover, other objectives are formulated to model the social and environmental pillars of sustainability. These objectives minimize the environmental effects of the standard newsvendor problem regarding the malicious environmental effects of unrecyclable unsold products. To solve the formulated model a compromise programming approach is hybridized with Lagrange relaxation and sub-gradient optimization for the proposed model. For more clarification, a real-world case study from the Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry with real data has been employed alongside sensitivity analysis. Moreover, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solving approach, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm were also designed and their parameters were tuned using the Taguchi method. Comparing the obtained results with the classical newsvendor model, the single economic objective loses at least 0.76% and at most 14.1% of its achievements by a trade-off with sustainable criteria. Furthermore, results indicated that both in terms of optimality and solution time, the proposed method has an extraordinary performance compared to GA and SA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Inventory; Lagrange relaxation; Multi-objective Optimization; Newsvendor Problem; Sub-gradient Optimization; Sustainability","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Lagrange multipliers; Sensitivity analysis; Simulated annealing; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Taguchi methods; Emerging economies; Inventory; Lagrange relaxation; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Multi-products; Newsvendor models; Newsvendor problem; Newsvendors; Sub-gradient optimization; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106321661

This limits a plaintiff's ability to sue. Crowdfunding has emerged as a new way to cover expenses. This article explores factors that contribute to success in litigation crowdfunding. Using data from CrowdJustice we study the impact of valence, arousal, and dominance in case description, on the funding success, considering the number of pledges, target amount, description, country, and category of the cases. Our findings show that while valence and arousal are negatively associated, dominance is positively associated, with funding success. All three associations are stronger for public interest cases. We highlight the importance of affective words and offer evidence of affect-driven decision-making in backers seeking to support crowdfunding litigation cases. Next, we highlight the power of the crowd, and show that cases concerning causes with public awareness are most likely to be successful. Therefore, the scale of the support base is crucial. For crowdfunding litigators, attaching the right cause amplifies the impact of affective words on the likelihood of successful funding.

Such technologies require consumers to give up control to a machine by delegating decision-making power. To better understand value perceptions, and ultimately adoption, this paper proposes a conceptual model that explains the value attributed to autonomous cars as an archetypal consumer autonomous technology. The model is developed from literature around the theme of autonomy and two qualitative studies, which identify consumers’ perceived individual benefits (Freeing Time, Overcoming Human Weaknesses, Outperforming Human Capacities), risks (Loss of Competencies, Security and Privacy risk, Performance risk) and their proximal antecedents (Perceived Expertise, Attitude toward the Delegated Task, Previous Engagement in Delegation). The model is tested on a national sample of French drivers using a quantitative methodology and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). This research contributes to literature on technological forecasting of autonomous technologies by developing and testing a conceptual model, which includes salient predictors of perceived value and highlights the mediating role of improvement in subjective well-being that consumers anticipate from adoption. The model can be used by managers to predict how users are likely to react to their products and communications about them. © 2021","Autonomous cars; Autonomous products; Consumers; Perceived value; Well-being","Decision making; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Well testing; Autonomous car; Autonomous product; Autonomous technology; Conceptual model; Consumer; Decisions makings; Perceived value; Rapid growth; Value model; Well being; Autonomous vehicles; car use; conceptual framework; consumption behavior; decision making; perception; quantitative analysis; technology adoption; unmanned vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106278171

To do so, we compare several models based on movie data, Facebook data, and Twitter data. We benchmark these model comparisons using various prediction algorithms. Next, we apply information-fusion sensitivity analysis to evaluate which variables are driving the predictive performance. Our analysis shows that social media data significantly increases the predictive power of traditional box office prediction models. Facebook data clearly outperform Twitter data and including user-generated content next to marketer-generated always improves predictive power. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that volume and valence based combination variables pertaining to Facebook comments are the most important variables. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the potential mechanisms driving differential predictive ability of Facebook and Twitter.

We argue that operational control by private companies, an attractive fiscal regime, and investor protection clauses were crucial elements in fostering the expansion of the oil industry after the oil opening in the 1990s. However, a successful investment cycle adding production and reserves, combined with an oil price boom, provided strong incentives for the government to increase taxes and expropriate projects. Weak institutions, policy instability, and the lack of credible property rights for the sector generated high “above ground risks” inhibiting FDI during the oil boom, despite the massive resource base and the substantial number of deals signed. FDI underperformance contributed to the decline of the Venezuelan oil industry, even before the imposition of U.S. sanctions. Using project-level data, and industry indicators, we document how volatile fiscal terms, changes in contract governance, discretionary policies, poor operating conditions, and the lack of investor protection, explain the failure to attract FDI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Expropriation; Foreign investment; Oil and gas; Venezuela","Petroleum industry; Proven reserves; Above grounds; Expropriation; Foreign direct investments; Foreign investment; Investment cycle; Oil and gas; Oil industries; Operational control; Private companies; Venezuela; Investments; foreign direct investment; gas industry; industrial investment; oil industry; private sector; Venezuela",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105346754

Previous studies have aimed to categorize this area using traditional review approaches, using a smaller body of literature and mostly focusing on the managerial aspects of remanufacturing. Our paper is the only study for which tech-mining and scientometric methods are used to examine remanufacturing research, for the purpose of identifying top actors and key trends with regard to business and technological approaches. We combine both management- and engineering-related studies in this scientometric study. The results shed light on the principal actors, nations, organizations, and scientific domains in this field. Remanufacturing research is categorized using the co-occurrence-based clustering method. This paper identifies four broad research clusters: production planning and control of remanufacturing, material and remanufacturing engineering, supply chain management of remanufacturing process, and remanufacturing applications and new trends.

In our study context, we focus specifically on the effectiveness of a second gatekeeping stage in the ED - a clinical decision unit (CDU). Although only 9.9% of patients in our sample are routed through the CDU, we find that had the unit not been in place during the observation period, the rates of unnecessary hospitalization and wrongful patient discharge from the ED would have increased by 14.3% and 29.6%, respectively. We also find that the CDU is especially beneficial for patients with a high ex ante risk of experiencing unnecessary hospitalization, with the rate for the most high-risk patients reduced from 14.0% without the CDU to just 4.8% had all such patients been routed through the CDU. The appropriateness of referrals is therefore a key contributor to the CDU's effectiveness: We estimate that random allocation of patients in our study hospital to the CDU would have reduced the unit's effectiveness by more than half. Finally, we investigate a critical trade-off in designing a two-stage gatekeeping system: Resources must be split between the two stages, increasing congestion in the first stage when the second stage is enlarged. We demonstrate that in the study hospital, the combination of an ED and CDU performs better than a pooled system that combines the capacity of both stages to enlarge the ED but does not have a designated CDU. In fact, we estimate that in this specific case, reducing the size of the first-stage ED in order to expand CDU capacity from the current 9.9% of ED patients to 25% would further reduce unnecessary hospitalizations by up to 33%. We discuss the insights that these results provide as to the circumstances under which it may be advantageous to add a second stage to a gatekeeping system. © 2020 INFORMS.","Congestion; Econometrics; Emergency department; Gatekeeping; Healthcare: hospitals; Referral error","Economic and social effects; Clinical decision; Emergency departments; Empirical studies; Gatekeeping; High-risk patients; Observation Period; Patient discharge; Random allocation; Emergency rooms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111768936

To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust optimization approach, whereby adaptive uncertainty sets capture the information acquired through monitoring. We consider two versions of the problem - static and dynamic - depending on how the monitoring times are chosen. We show that, under certain conditions, the same worst-case reward is achievable under either static or dynamic monitoring. This allows recovering the optimal dynamic monitoring policy by resolving static versions of the problem. We discuss cases when the static problem becomes tractable and highlight conditions when monitoring at equidistant times is optimal. Lastly, we showcase our framework in the context of a healthcare problem (monitoring heart-transplant patients for cardiac allograft vasculopathy), where we design optimal monitoring policies that substantially improve over the status quo recommendations. © 2020 INFORMS.","Monitoring; Optimal stopping problem; Robust optimization","Decision making; Delta modulation; Health care; Optimization; Computational resources; Dynamic monitoring; Healthcare problems; Heart transplant; Limited information; Optimal dynamics; Optimal monitoring; Robust optimization; Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111710466

This study evaluates the impact from transitioning to a modern irrigation technology. Deciding to adopt or not an alternative irrigation technology (sprinklers) is not necessarily a random determination. Therefore, selection bias can be present and this can lead to biased estimates. In this study, we apply methodological specifications to correct for self-selectivity biases. Then, we measure and compare the technical efficiency scores from adopters and non-adopters. The empirical application uses data covering 56 small-scale greenhouse farms in Crete (Greece) for the cropping years 2009-2013. The results reveal that the average technical efficiency for farmers who adopted sprinkler irrigation is lower than the group of non-adopters, when the presence of selectivity bias cannot be rejected. This implies that either the farmers need more time to incorporate the know-how of the newly acquired technology or they become less motivated after the adoption. Consequently, agricultural water saving technologies need to be promoted in combination with support to the farmers, so they can cope with the lower performance in the first years after adoption. © 2021, The Author(s).","Impact evaluation; Irrigation technology adoption; Sample selection; Stochastic frontier; Technical efficiency","Agricultural robots; Efficiency; Hose; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Water conservation; Agricultural water; Alternative irrigations; Biased estimates; Development project; Impact evaluation; Sprinkler irrigation; Technical efficiency; Water security; Technology transfer; agricultural technology; data; development project; environmental impact assessment; irrigation system; technical efficiency; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109154807

This paper investigates the impact of online review richness (i.e., reviews containing videos or follow-on reviews) on sales. Leveraging attribute substitution theory, we conjecture that online review richness can provide heuristic cues in the online shopping environment to help consumers make better purchase decisions. Using data from JD.com, we found that reviews containing either videos or follow-on reviews positively affect sales. In addition, different product types can also serve as heuristic cues to replace target cues, which can further affect how different forms of online review richness affect sales. We found that the impact of online review richness on sales is stronger for utilitarian products than for hedonic products, and stronger for negatively commented products than for positively commented products. Moreover, we conducted two online experiments and confirmed that the causal relationship is from online review richness to sales.

What is less commonly understood is that using self-reported information for decision-making results in endogenous selection bias, which creates spurious associations between the measure being reported and factors that influence reporting. Thus, conditioning on self-reported information can lead to inaccurate evaluations of firms and bias predictions of future performance, even when the self-reported measure is not intentionally misrepresented. We examine endogenous selection bias in self-reporting regimes using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We illustrate the problem using data from a policy change by the U.S. Department of Transportation that allowed firms to report not-at-fault for accidents. We find that large for-hire firms are much more likely to report not-at-fault for accidents—over 40 times more likely than independent drivers—even after controlling for time, location, and weather. When comparing independent drivers with large firms, the reporting disparities make large firms appear 25% safer when using at-fault accidents versus all accidents while providing no improvement in predicting future accidents. This study highlights the consequences of poorly designed information-gathering mechanisms and the usefulness of DAGs for understanding causality in supply chain research. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","DAGs; endogenous selection bias; supply chain safety; transportation policy","Decision making; Directed graphs; Supply chains; At faults; Directed acyclic graphs; Future performance; Information gathering; Policy changes; Selection bias; Self-reporting; U.S. Department of Transportation; Accidents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107312520

These qualities, along with ease of accessibility and relatively low acquisition costs, make TM data an attractive source for the supplementation of traditional transportation survey data, which are facing growing threats to quality. This paper develops a typology demonstrating ways in which TM data can aid in the design of transport studies, as well as in the augmentation of modeling efforts and policy scenarios, allowing for improved understanding and forecasting of travel-related attributes. However, challenges associated with integrating, validating, and understanding TM variables have resulted in only a few transportation studies that have used these data thus far. In this paper, we provide a transportation discipline-specific resource for TM data, informed by our integration of an extensive TM database with both the National Household Travel Survey (Georgia subset) and a statewide travel behavior survey conducted in Georgia on behalf of the Georgia Department of Transportation. Using the resultant datasets, we validate TM data by means of several approaches, and find that the TM dataset reports gender, age, tenure, race, marital status, and household size with match rates ranging from 70% to 90% relative to both transportation surveys. However, we also identify biases in favor of population segments that may have more longstanding financial/transactional records (e.g., males, homeowners, non-minorities, and older individuals), biases comparable but not identical to those of survey data. While this work suggests wide-ranging implications for the use of TM data in transportation, we caution that flexible and responsible approaches to using these data are critical for staying abreast of evolving privacy regulations that govern third-party data sources such as these. © 2021 The Authors","Big data; Consumer data; Household travel survey; Targeted marketing data; Third-party data; Travel behavior; Travel demand modeling","Commerce; Data integration; Marketing; Population statistics; Surveys; Consumer data; Data-source; Household travel surveys; Survey data; Targeted marketing; Targeted marketing data; Third party datum; Transportation surveys; Travel behaviour; Travel demand modelling; Big data; data set; household survey; marketing; modeling; transportation; travel demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107058993

Moreover, we find evidence of a positive association between executive accountants and accrual quality and faster remediation of material weaknesses in internal control when an executive accountant is present. Taken together, this evidence is consistent with more reliable financial reporting at firms with an executive accountant. In contrast, accountants identified in commonly used datasets (i.e., Execucomp or BoardEx) are not consistently associated with the reliability of financial reporting. We highlight the significant differences between datasets, largely attributable to the objectives and sources of the underlying data.

However, little is known of the factors that may determine the flow of international infrastructure investment to those countries. This study aims to bridge that knowledge gap, first by identifying the determinants of international infrastructure investment, and then by developing a structural equation model to reveal their underlying interrelationships. The structural equation model is applied to country-level data regarding international infrastructure investment with Chinese contractors in 141 countries worldwide over the 9-year period from 2009 to 2017. The results show that three determinants, namely infrastructure quality, labor supply, and investment interdependency, have a positive relationship with a country's international infrastructure investment inflow. However, another determinant, institutional environment, has a significantly negative impact, which suggests that when making foreign infrastructure investment, Chinese contractors enter countries with a comparatively poor institutional environment with substantial political risks. The results also highlight how much a robust infrastructure development plan can help developing countries avoid the poor-infrastructure trap, a situation in which poor infrastructure quality discourages international infrastructure investment. These research findings may assist international infrastructure investment firms to make informed decisions with regard to financing and managing projects and help policymakers who focus on attracting foreign investment in infrastructure. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Belt and road initiative; Foreign direct investment (FDI) interdependency; Infrastructure investment; Infrastructure quality; Institutional environment; Structure equation modeling","Bridges; Contractors; Developing countries; Employment; Economic progress; Foreign investment; Informed decision; Infrastructure development; Infrastructure investment; Managing projects; Political risks; Structural equation modeling; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104980841

In this study, we examine whether and how firms can leverage consumers’ social connections and engage consumers to share promotional incentives. In collaboration with a leading online deal platform, we report a large-scale randomized field experiment to test the effectiveness of different incentive designs (varying in the shareability and scarcity of promotion codes) in driving social sharing senders’ purchases and successful referrals. We find that the different incentive designs have distinct impacts on the purchase and referral outcomes. Specifically, providing senders with one non-shareable promo code significantly increases their own purchase likelihood, compared to the other experimental groups. In contrast, senders who receive one shareable promo code are less likely to purchase themselves yet are more likely to make successful referrals. Surprisingly, the incentive design with two promo codes containing one non-shareable code and one shareable code increases neither the senders’ purchases nor their successful referrals. Managerially, we estimate that although the one non-shareable promo code group derives the highest net revenue for the experimental period, the one shareable promo code group derives the highest customer lifetime value for the firm from the new customers acquired through the successful referrals. We further conducted two online experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk that replicate the field experiment’s findings and explore the underlying mechanisms of the observed relationships. We find that exclusivity perception and social motives triggered by the incentive designs with one promo code mediate their effects on senders’ self-purchases and successful referrals, respectively, and explain the ineffectiveness of two promo codes. Our study contributes to the bodies of literature on IT-enabled social sharing and social promotions, providing implications for firms on how to design promotional incentives that accommodate the dual role of consumers as purchasers and sharers. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

We study the relationship between online engagement and offline sales, utilizing a quasi-experimental setting in which a leading premium automobile brand gradually launched a new interactive website across markets, allowing for a treatment-control comparison. This paper offers evidence of a causal effect of online engagement on offline sales, with the high-engagement website leading to a decline of approximately 12% in car sales. This negative effect is due to substitution between online and offline engagement; users of the high-engagement website exhibited a decreased tendency to seek out personal contact with a car dealer and proceed to offline engagement—a necessary stage in the car purchase funnel. We develop an analytical model of the online-to-offline sales funnel to generalize our findings and highlight the conditions under which online engagement substitutes for offline engagement and potentially decreases offline sales. Taken together, our findings suggest that while online engagement serves as a means for both product information provision and consumer persuasion, it may fall short in achieving the latter goal, as compared to the offline channel. For purely offline products, hands-on engagement is a necessary step toward purchase. Thus, increasing consumers’ online engagement may not be an optimal strategy if it has the potential to halt progression down the sales funnel and reduce offline engagement. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

We first linearize the model using extensions of McCormick relaxation technique and then solve using a combined Sample Average Approximation with a Scenario Decomposition algorithm. A real life case study is presented to draw a several key managerial insights. It is observed that the disruption prevention model is able to reduce 16% overall system cost upon a power outage.

Within the literature focused on the institutional antecedents of formalization, less attention has been paid to the drivers of formal management practices. To help fill this gap, we study how state and market institutional logics affect the adoption and utility of formal management practices in manufacturing firms. We theorize how institutional complexity, resulting from coexistent, conflicting state and market institutional logics, may exert differential pressure on state-owned and private firms’ decisions to adopt these practices, diverging from prior studies that focus primarily on the role of market logics in their adoption. We then test these propositions in a representative sample of 390 manufacturing firms in China with uniquely detailed data on structured management practices using regression analysis. Variation in ownership differentiates the relative influence of state and market institutional logics on firms in China's transition economy. We find that measures of structured management practices are higher for state-owned firms, while scores are significantly lower for domestic private firms. We further show that, on average, a firm's overall management practice score is positively and significantly related to total factor productivity (TFP) in state-owned firms, but the correlation is no different from zero in both domestic and foreign private firms. Our findings support a role for structured management practices as a response to institutional complexity, by enabling firms to satisfy multiple imperatives from distinct audiences. © 2021 The Author(s)","China; Institutional complexity; Management; Ownership; Productivity","complexity; firm ownership; management practice; manufacturing; regression analysis; state owned enterprise; total factor productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102444233

Using order-level data from an online fashion retailer in Sweden, we investigate the introduction of free returns for customers in Denmark starting November 1, 2017, but not for customers in Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Germany, and the rest of Europe (the control group). Using difference-in-differences, with and without sample matching, the introduction of free returns increased the order bill by 54.95 Swedish Krona (SEK) (9.15%), product variety per order by 0.057 (8.74%), gross margin per order by 29.90 SEK (9.71%), and returns by 0.195 items per order (7.86%). This likelihood of increased returns was generally similar across different product categories. The findings are robust to parallel trends, event studies, placebo effects, alternative control groups (with Scandinavian countries, Sweden and Norway), country-time trends, and correlations between outcome variables.

Using an advanced four-component stochastic frontier model on Belgian adult education data, we distinguish between persistent and transient inefficiency of adult education programs. Whereas persistent inefficiency is structural and difficult to tackle because of its time-invariant nature, transient inefficiency can be eliminated somewhat easily without a major structural change. Thus, reduction in different inefficiency components may require different policy measures. Our results indicate that despite the presence of persistent inefficiency, the overall inefficiency is mainly driven by the transient component, and hence, at the control of the adult education management. The findings suggest that social interaction is relevant in adult education as both more sessions and more learners per program increase educational efficiency. Moreover, adult education programs seem to be particularly useful for young less-educated learners. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adult education; Four-component model; Inefficiency; Stochastic frontier analysis","adult education; efficiency measurement; numerical model; policy approach; stochasticity; structural change; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094955764

In this paper, we estimate a nonparametric production function, in which technology spillovers and common shocks have persistent effects on productivity and are controlled for through spatial networks and a factor structure in the productivity evolution process. We synthesize the proxy variable method to structurally identifying the production functions using the semiparametric common correlated effect estimator. The proposed model is then applied to the Chinese computer and peripheral equipment firms. We find that the annual productivity growth rate in this high-technology sector is about 15%. While firms are cross-sectionally dependent via both spatial and non-spatial connections, the productivity growth is largely explained by firms’ own effort, and mildly explained by the neighbors’ activities. Productivity is found to be higher in the areas of agglomeration, and the common shock effects on productivity are not necessarily correlated with the spatial variables. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agglomeration; Chinese computer and peripheral equipment firms; Cross-sectional dependence; Productivity; Technology spillover","estimation method; growth rate; high technology industry; industrial agglomeration; industrial performance; industrial production; productivity; spillover effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089099789

Meanwhile, the interactive paths amongst the six groups were proposed. A questionnaire survey was performed with 210 practitioners experienced in IJVs in HSR projects to assess the significance of the factors, and 113 valid questionnaires were received. Based on the collected data, six groups of 22 determinants and nine interactive paths were verified by applying partial least-squares structural equation modeling technology. Specifically, these significant paths could be classified into two categories, namely the coopetition-capability oriented paths, and the coopetition-relationship oriented paths.

An expanding body of literature relates to assessing whether consumers would be willing to pay for these ‘green’ practices in the aviation industry, such as biofuels or sustainable airport construction/renovations. While previous studies have experimentally examined these scenarios, we are aware of no prior research that has proposed and assessed a structural model related to determining which factors influence consumer's perspectives on ‘green’ airports. A sample of 722 eligible participants from the United States completed the study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We examined future time perspective, affect toward climate change, the perceived value of sustainability, and perceptions of climate change on the endogenous variables of willingness to pay for sustainability and intentions to take action against climate change. Six of the seven hypotheses proposed were supported. Affect, perceived value, and perceptions of climate change were all significant and positively related to willingness to pay, which was positively associated with intention to act. Two non-hypothesized paths, between perceived value and future time perspective, were also positively related to intention to act.

These studies have demonstrated that newly emerging digital platforms financing early-stage ventures threaten traditional venture capital (VC). We argue that, conversely, VC benefits from advances in information and communication technology (ICT), as ICT fosters entrepreneurship and mitigates agency issues in VC deals. This paper examines the impact of digitization on VC investments from 23 European countries spanning 2007–2019 using a dynamic panel two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique. The results show that the factors “ICT penetration” (a general measure of societal internet and computer access and use) and “digital economy” (a measure of ICT-powered economic activity) exert significant and positive effects on early-stage, later-stage, and total VC investments. Moreover, availability of bank credit moderates the effect of digital economy on VC investment. Finally, this study reveals that it is digital entrepreneurship (as reflected in our “digital economy” measure), and not total entrepreneurial activity, that attracts VC investment. We conclude that the VC industry is aligned with rather than threatened by the newly emerging digital environment. The empirical results are robust to different control variables and data sources. This paper offers useful implications for policy and contributes to the literature on digital entrepreneurship and venture capital. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Digital entrepreneurship; Digitization; Financial development; FinTechs; ICT; Venture capital","Investments; Method of moments; Digital environment; Disruptive technology; Economic activities; Entrepreneurial activity; Estimation techniques; European Countries; Generalized method of moments; Information and Communication Technologies; Economics; digital image; financial system; information and communication technology; innovation; investment; technological change; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103273958

IRI can lead to significant issues in retail, e.g., by causing stockouts and revenue losses triggered by unnecessary replenishment. This paper evaluates the effects of IRI on retail store inventory and sales management performance. We propose a novel network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model, capable of setting store-level performance standards more accurately than state-of-the-art models. To support managers in identifying the root causes of IRI and in setting realistic target for mitigating IRI, the insights of the proposed NDEA model are used to develop two novel performance indicators: the IRI improvement potential and the IRI improvement workload. This research uses real-life data of an international fashion retailer. The data set contains information of more than 5,250,000 inventory items kept in 81 retail stores. The computational experiments show the benefit of using relative measures to quantify IRI levels accurately across SKUs. Furthermore, decomposing store-level management into inventory management and sales management is found to be highly beneficial for evaluating the impact of IRI on store-level performance. Numerical results also demonstrate that IRI improvement is small for near-efficient stores and remarkably large for highly inefficient stores. © 2021 The Author(s)","Inventory record inaccuracy; Network data envelopment analysis; Retail; Store performance; Supply chain","Data envelopment analysis; Information management; Inventory control; Retail stores; Supply chains; Data envelopment analysis models; Inventory management; Inventory management systems; Inventory record inaccuracy; Network data; Network data envelopment analyse; Performance; Sales management; Stock outs; Store performance; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103101080

A conceptual framework inspired by swarm intelligence theory is introduced to measure the emergence degree or level for a specific technology. Swarm intelligence belongs to complex systems theory, and has evolved into a helpful tool for heuristic algorithms and optimization computation, and brought forward an insightful perspective on the evolution and emergence of natural or social systems in the past decades. To verify the proposed framework for measuring emergence degree of a specific technology based on the basic philosophy of swarm intelligence, a case study analyzes an annual set of emerging technologies of the World Economic Forum.

Developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and operations research have increased the prevalence of computer systems in decision making tasks across a myriad of applications. Markov decision processes (MDPs) are utilized in a variety of system controllers, and attacks against them are of particular interest, even though this problem structure is relatively understudied in the adversarial learning literature. Therefore, in this research, we consider the finite-horizon MDP poisoning problem wherein an adversary perturbs a decision maker's baseline MDP formulation to induce desired behavior while balancing the risk of attack detection. We formally define the associated mathematical programming formulation as a mixed-integer bilevel programming problem. We provide a single-level representation that can be handled by some commercial global solvers, but, since their performance is frequently inadequate, we develop gradient-based, gradient-free, and bifurcation heuristic solution methodologies that include self-tuning extensions. The performance of these algorithms is explored on a wide array of sample problem instances to determine their relative efficacy in terms of solution quality and computational effort for different finite-horizon MDP structures. © 2020","Adversarial learning; Data poisoning; Machine learning; Markov decision process; Reinforcement learning","Artificial intelligence; Balancing; Behavioral research; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Learning systems; Markov processes; Operations research; Adversarial learning; Bilevel programming problem; Computational effort; Finite-horizon Markov decision process; Heuristic solutions; Markov Decision Processes; Poisoning problem; System controllers; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100082378

Using daily data from 16 futures markets, we discover that the conventional quantile hedge ratio displays an inverted U shape to various extents for different futures. When looking into high- and low-volatility states, quantile hedge ratios show different results compared with conventional models. While the quantile hedge ratio in low-volatility state is relatively flat, in high-volatility state, the quantile hedge varies with the spot return distribution and displays a U-type relationship. Moreover, the U shape is more prominent for agricultural futures and less prominent for others. Also, by comparing hedging effectiveness, the quantile hedge strategy is found to be more effective than the no-hedge strategy and the hedging strategy derived from error correction models. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Futures; Hedge ratio; Markov regime switching; Quantile hedging","error correction; Markov chain; numerical model; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079541530

While studies on inequality in sub-Saharan Africa are becoming numerous, less attention has been devoted so far to the growing polarization the region is undergoing. Polarization, as distinct from inequality, refers to the tendency of shifting away from the centre of a distribution to its tails, creating a hollowed-out middle. This paper, using a set of sub-Saharan African national household surveys, provides a first estimate of the regional expenditures' polarization. This latter steadily increased throughout the 2000s and its growth was mainly driven by increasing polarization between countries, meaning sub-Saharan Africa tended to polarize spatially, with the Southern cone countries and some Western African countries performing above the average, and the rest of the region lagging behind. © 2020 Oxford University Press 2020.

Examples include in-home video entertainment, technology goods and services, multisourced data platforms, and patent pools. This paper develops an economic model to study demand, production choices, revenue sharing, and relative market power in such markets. Producers in these markets are not rivalrous competitors in the usual zero-sum sense, because output of each casts an externality on production decisions of others and total market demand expands with total output, albeit with diminishing returns. This property allows multiple producers to flourish in equilibrium (versus just one with the most favorable technological or cost structure), and more so when the market expands less quickly with total output. Equilibrium production quantities of competitors are strategic complements, yet competition between producers does manifest itself, for example, if one acquires better production technology (i.e., makes value units at lower cost) then the equilibrium production levels of other producers are reduced. Insights are also derived for alternative market structures, for example, producers have more output and earn higher profit when organized into a distribution consortium (e.g., Hulu or consortia of zoos or museums) versus relying on a separate retailer. Mergers between producers have similar effect. The formulation enables us to rigorously answer economic questions ranging from pricing, revenue sharing, and production levels in a static setting, to market dynamics covering both the causes and effects of changes in industry structure. © 2020 INFORMS","Aggregators; Bundling; Platforms; Revenue sharing; Value cocreation","Management; Operations research; Economic structure; Industry structures; Market structures; Production decisions; Production quantity; Production technology; Strategic complements; Value aggregations; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105281794

In both personal and workplace environments, advances in information technology and the availability of information have enabled people to perform much more search and access much more information for decision making than ever before. Because of this abundance of information, there is an increasing need to develop an improved understanding of how people stop search, since information available for most decisions is now almost infinite. Our goal in this paper is to further our understanding of information search and stopping, and we do so by examining the neurocorrelates of stopping information search. This is a process that involves both stopping the search and the decision to stop the search. We asked subjects to search for information about consumer products and to stop when they believed they had enough information to make a subsequent decision about whether to purchase those products while in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) chamber. Brain activation patterns revealed an extensive distributed network of areas that are engaged in the decision to stop searching for information that are not engaged in search itself, suggesting that stopping is a complex and cognitively demanding neurological activity.

In this paper, we focus on the interactions between economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and climate action (SDG 13). Some previous studies have found an inverted U-shaped relationship between income per capita and inequality, and a similar relationship between income per capita and environmental degradation. Despite their weak theoretical and empirical bases, these hypothesized relationships have gained popularity and are assumed to be universally true. Given differences in underlying contextual conditions across countries, the assumption of universal applicability of these curves for policy prescriptions can be potentially misleading. Advances in data analytics offer novel ways to probe deeper into these complex interactions. Using data from 70 countries, representing 72% of the world population and 89% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), we apply a nonparametric classification tree technique to identify clusters of countries that share similar development pathways in the pre-recession (1980–2008) and post-recession (2009–2014) period. The main outcome of interest is the change in per capita CO2 emissions (post-recession). We examine how it varies with trajectories of GDP growth, GDP growth variability, Gini index, carbon intensity, and CO2 emissions (pre-recession). Our study identifies twelve country clusters with three categories of emission trajectories: decreasing (four clusters), stabilizing (three clusters), and increasing (five clusters). Through the application of data mining tools, the study helps unravel the complexity of factors underlying development pathways and contributes toward informed policy decisions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Archetypes; Classification tree; Clustering; Development trajectories; Environmental Kuznets curve; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","complexity; data mining; economic growth; economic planning; empirical analysis; environmental degradation; Gross Domestic Product; growth; Sustainable Development Goal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087947982

It is argued that the incidence of mutual, and not necessarily unilateral, trust between the employee representation and the management accounts for these differences, as mutual trust fosters information sharing and helps to strike deals that are mutually beneficial. Against the background that the institutional and organizational characteristics of some workplace employment relations regimes also constitutes information sharing and joint decision making, the author further argues that mutual trust is a functional equivalent. Design/methodology/approach: Methodologically, the article is international and cross-country comparative in nature and conducted on the basis of a unique, large and transnational comparable data set of the employment relationship at firm level in eleven countries. Findings: Our results show that strong mutual trust is associated with significantly higher incidences of increases in firm profitability, regardless of the workplace employment relations regime in which the firms are embedded. Practical implications: The results clearly indicate that trust between the employee representation and the management works as a functional equivalent to performance enhancing employment relations regimes. Therefore, some policy recommendations and imposed institutional reforms of employment relations regimes by the IMF and the European Central Bank in some countries are sub-optimal and might not have been necessary. Trust building initiatives between the employee representation and the management are therefore an alternative, which is less conflictual and could have the same effect on the performance of firms. Originality/value: Previous analyses on differences in the performance effects of workplace employment relations regime concentrated almost exclusively on institutional factors. Factors that account for differences in the functioning of regimes such as in particular the role of trust were not considered before. Against this background, the originality of this analysis is that it clearly shows that it is not sufficient to consider only the institutional and organizational structure of regimes, but it is essential for a better understanding of the effects of the employment relationship to consider factors which account for the functioning of the regimes such as, in particular, trust. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Efficiency; Employee relations; Financial performance; Inter organization management; Organization effectiveness; Work systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100159707

This situation has driven government policy level support for transformational change initiatives, such as value-based health care (VBHC), through closer alignment and collaboration across the health-care system-life science sector nexus. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the necessary antecedents to collaboration in VBHC through a critical exploration of the existing literature, with a view to establishing the foundations for further development of policy, practice and theory in this field. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted via searches on Scopus and Google Scholar between 2009 and 2019 for peer-reviewed articles containing keywords and phrases “Value-based healthcare industry” and “healthcare industry collaboration”. Refinement of the results led to the identification of “guiding conditions” (GCs) for collaboration in VBHC. Findings: Five literature-derived GCs were identified as necessary for the successful implementation of initiatives such as VBHC through system-sector collaboration. These are: a multi-disciplinarity; use of appropriate technological infrastructure; capturing meaningful metrics; understanding the total cycle-of-care; and financial flexibility. This paper outlines research opportunities to empirically test the relevance of the five GCs with regard to improving system-sector collaboration on VBHC. Originality/value: This paper has developed a practical and constructive framework that has the potential to inform both policy and further theoretical development on collaboration in VBHC. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Government; Health care; Industry; Innovation; Life science sector; Management; NHS; Organization; Policy; Process; VBHC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089155460

To answer this question, we study the association between firms' engagement in REM and the extent of commitment to planned investments in IT infrastructure. We also study the extent to which this association is moderated by IT decentralization, and, in turn, how such a moderating relationship is influenced by other corporate governance mechanisms such as institutional ownership and takeover threats. We document three important findings based on our analyses of data on 2, 884 U.S. firms over the period 1998-2009. First, we find a negative association between engagement in REM and IT infrastructure investment commitment, suggesting potentially negative consequences of REM for realizing IT investment plans. Second, we find that IT decentralization weakens the negative association between REM and IT investment commitment (ITIC), implying that decentralized IT governance mechanisms can serve as a potential antidote to negative effects of REM on IT investments. Finally, we find evidence that other corporate governance mechanisms, such as institutional ownership and takeover threats, can complement IT decentralization to further mitigate the negative association between REM and ITIC. Together, these findings provide new insights on how REM, IT decentralization, and other corporate governance mechanisms influence actual IT investments of firms. Our work here, which focuses on deviations from one's own IT investment plans, makes a novel contribution by extending prior work which has so far focused only on deviations from industry norm in IT investments. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

Based on a unique dataset that includes reviews as well as pertinent purchases at the individual level from a large online retailer, this study investigates whether consumers exhibit time habits for online shopping and whether following such time habits affects their satisfaction and revisit behavior. We employ activity-based metrics to assess individual shopping time habits, and the results show that consumers form shopping time habits and obtain higher consumer satisfaction and exhibit greater revisit behavior when the timing of shopping follows their shopping time habits. While prior works have documented that consumers exhibit time habits for physical shopping, driven mostly by time and location constraints, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to examine online shopping time habit and, most importantly, its effects on consumer satisfaction and revisit behavior. With the availability of detailed individual transaction data in online shopping and the advance of technology in providing personalized services that enable companies to act upon knowledge of individual behaviors, this research provides important practical implications for system and website design, marketing strategy, and customer relationship management. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained widespread popularity as a mode of sustainable transport. The increasing demand for of electric vehicles (EVs) has reduced the some of the environmental issues and urban space requirements for parking and road usage. The current body of EV literature is replete with different optimization and empirical approaches pertaining to the design and analysis of the EV ecosystem; however, probing the EV ecosystem from a management perspective has not been analyzed. To address this gap, this paper develops a systems-based framework to offer rigorous design and analysis of the EV ecosystem, with a focus on charging station location problems. The study framework includes: (1) examination of the EV charging station location problem through the lens of a systems perspective; (2) a systems view of EV ecosystem structure; and (3) development of a reference model for EV charging stations by adopting the viable system model.

Empirical data analysis to determine the socio-spatial characteristics of flood-related reporting trends between 2013 and 2017 from four diverse neighborhoods highlights two important capabilities of crowdsourced data i) identify unique problems experienced by diverse communities and thus address marginalization in managing flood related problems and ii) identify the patterns in types of problems experienced by neighborhoods characterized by divergent socioeconomic and biophysical vulnerabilities. Further, analysis of adoption rates of SeeClickFix in the context of neighborhood characteristics provides valuable insights into the scope of voluntary geographic information (VGI) and its potential role in participatory decision-making. Results indicate that problems of standing water/mosquito complaints are the majority of flood related reports in a high socioeconomic status and biophysically vulnerable neighborhoods, while stormwater infrastructure dominates repeated reports in socioeconomically vulnerable area, suggesting inadequate maintenance of critical infrastructures. Finally, the early adoption of the app and steady increase of reports in poorer neighborhoods during the study period indicates that crowdsourcing of data through a participatory Geoweb has the potential to give voice to marginalized communities and foster transparency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biophysical vulnerability; Crowdsourcing; Participatory decision making; Resilience; Socioeconomic vulnerability; VGI; Voluntary geographic data","decision making; disaster management; flood frequency; mapping method; marginalization; neighborhood; participatory approach; socioeconomic conditions; socioeconomic impact; socioeconomic status; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102266092

We focus on product categories where consumers may purchase multiple products during a season and investigate a new reason why frequent assortment rotations can be valuable to a retailer. Namely, by distributing its seasonal catalog of products over multiple assortments rotated throughout the season, as opposed to selling all products in a single, fixed assortment, the retailer effectively conceals a portion of its full product catalog from consumers, injecting uncertainty into the consumer’s relative product valuations. Rationally acting consumers may respond to this structural difference by purchasing more products, thereby generating additional sales for the retailer. We refer to this phenomenon as the value of concealment and show that the retailer enjoys a positive and significant value of concealment under quite general conditions. However, we show that when consumers are forward looking, the value of concealment is context dependent. We present insights and discuss intuition regarding which product categories likely lead to a positive versus negative value of concealment.

Due to the usually small and highly variable demand sizes, accurate forecasting of intermittent demand has always been challenging. However, accurate forecasting of intermittent demand is critical to the effective inventory management. In this study we present a band new method - modified TSB method for the forecasting of intermittent demand. The proposed method is based on TSB method, and adopts similar strategy, which has been used in mSBA method to update demand interval and demand occurrence probability when current demand is zero. To evaluate the proposed method, 16289 daily demand records from the M5 data set that are identified as intermittent demands according to two criteria, and an empirical data set consisting three years’ monthly demand history of 1718 medicine products are used.

However, it is unclear where to target policy solutions. We estimated excess returns (the extent to which a firm’s profits are higher than expected given the risk associated with their investments) for manufacturers and middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain to determine who is making excessive profits. Excess returns were calculated as the difference between return on invested capital and the expected returns given risk, which is known as the weighted average cost of capital. We compared excess returns for manufacturers and middlemen to the average for S&P 500 companies. We find that both manufacturers and middlemen have higher excess returns in 2013–2018 compared with the S&P 500. However, if we treat research and development (R&D) as an investment rather than an expense, we find that excess returns for pharmaceutical manufacturers are lower than the S&P 500 (1.7% vs. 3.6%), but biotech manufacturers (9.6%), wholesalers (8.1%), and insurers/PBM/retailers (5.9%) continue to have significantly higher excess returns compared to the S&P 500. Our findings suggest public policies that promote competition in all areas of the pharmaceutical supply chain are important avenues for curtailing drug spending. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Drug price policy; Drug prices; Excess returns; Pharmaceutical supply chain","drug; algorithm; commercial phenomena; cost; drug industry; economics; marketing; United States; Algorithms; Commerce; Costs and Cost Analysis; Drug Industry; Marketing; Pharmaceutical Preparations; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098765514

We obtain the online search data sets of the NAVER, one of the largest online search services in Korea, and the information on IPO stocks and their post-IPO stock returns at the Korea Exchange. We investigate the daily online search volume data of 87 companies that went public in the year of 2016. After analyzing the relations of the abnormal returns and online search volumes using the event study methods, we find that the lower the amount of online search for stocks before IPO, the higher the stock returns after IPO both in short and long-term. One standard deviation increase in search volume decreases one-day return by 3 basis points, two-day return by 6 basis points, and 4-day return by 10 basis points. These economically significant results become stronger if we control for benchmark returns, firm size, and book-to-market ratio.

The evolution of small-scale and large-scale geo-distributed datacenters operated and managed by individual Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) raises new challenges in terms of effective global resource sharing and management of autonomously-controlled individual datacenter resources towards a globally efficient resource allocation model. Earlier solutions for geo-distributed clouds have focused primarily on achieving global efficiency in resource sharing, that although tries to maximize the global resource allocation, results in significant inefficiencies in local resource allocation for individual datacenters and individual cloud provi ders leading to unfairness in their revenue and profit earned. In this paper, we propose a new contracts-based resource sharing model for federated geo-distributed clouds that allows CSPs to establish resource sharing contracts with individual datacenters apriori for defined time intervals during a 24 hour time period. Based on the established contracts, individual CSPs employ a contracts cost and duration aware job scheduling and provisioning algorithm that enables jobs to complete and meet their response time requirements while achieving both global resource allocation efficiency and local fairness in the profit earned. The proposed techniques are evaluated through extensive experiments using realistic workloads generated using the SHARCNET cluster trace. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability and resource sharing fairness of the proposed model. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Federated cloud; geo-distributed cloud; resource sharing; resource sharing contracts","Cloud computing; Contracts; Data structures; Efficiency; Profitability; Public policy; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Servers; Computational model; Distributed clouds; Federated clouds; Resource management; Resource sharing; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040994787

However, HFT trading marker prediction is a rarely investigated problem in Fintech literature. In this study, we first propose a novel manifold learning based HFT trading marker prediction model: M-SCAN to handle this challenge. Our study takes advantage of manifold embeddings of HFT data and seeks potential markers among the outliers in density-based clustering. We further propose HFT trading marker evaluation algorithms to validate the prediction effectiveness besides unveiling trading marker discovery via visualization. Our results demonstrate locally linear embedding (LLE) outperforms its peers in capturing trading markers in terms of accuracy and complexity for its local data structure keeping mechanism in embedding though different stocks may demonstrate their model preference under M-SCAN. Our studies also propose novel entropy and variance concentration ratios (VCR) to quantify HFT data and show that a high-entropy dataset is more likely to have better trading marker prediction than a low-entropy one.

Meanwhile, with super efficiency incorporated, the proposed model enabled to distinguish the DMU from DMUs with same efficiency value, further, a projection analysis was conducted to direct the improvement of the identified inefficient decision-making units (DMUs). Finally, the comprehensive green urbanization index system was applied to a western Chinese province (Sichuan Province) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models, from which it was found that the overall green urbanization efficiency in Sichuan province was 81.54%, due to an input distribution imbalance and low technical efficiency. © Copyright © 2021 Chen and Lu.","efficiency measure; green urbanization; projection and improved analysis; SBM model; Sichuan province","Energy management; Energy resources; Assessment index system; Decision making unit; Environment protection; Input distributions; Performance assessment; Projection analysis; Slacks-based measure models; Technical efficiency; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101595081

Various mitigation measures such as business closures have been imposed to reduce health risks. Such measures also limit economic activities and reduce emissions. Measures disproportionately affect the contact-intensive sectors such as the leisure and hospitality industry, as their economic activities involve more person-to-person interactions.

To achieve this aim, there is a need for a measurement program to manage both quantitative and qualitative measurements, considering uncertainties. In this research, the Hierarchical Evidential Reasoning (HER) procedure is utilized to handle uncertainties and complications in the productivity evaluation area. For evaluating apparel productivity, the HER method is used to develop a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) structure. The suggested structure is performed to assess the productivity of twelve garments industries in Bangladesh. After assessing productivity, a comparison and sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the critical measures that contribute to enhance productivity. In this study, it can be observed that Yager's rule and Dempster-Shafer theory present administrators with a decision-making mechanism, which can help them to prioritize productivity characteristics, assessing the traits, and judgmental assessment to gain the total consequence of productivity. Therefore, examining the status allows the supervisors to elaborate plans for a greater state and enhance overall productivity. As one of the findings of this research based on Yager's rule and Dempster-Shafer theory, DBL Company, compared with 11 other organizations in Bangladesh, has the highest value of the index, which indicates the overall performance of DBL Company is much better compared to the other organizations.

Yet projects routinely suffer from the influence of Parkinson's Law. This behavioural phenomenon routinely results in failure to deliver work that is completed early before its assigned deadline. As a consequence, the late completion of other work is not offset, and overall project performance suffers. Hence, project success rates below 40% are widely reported. Our work uses mechanism design within non-cooperative game theory. A particular issue in the design process is to eliminate the possibility that a project worker with multiple dependent tasks can improve their incentive payment by falsely reporting some of their task completion times. From our review of the academic and business literature of project management, no incentive scheme used in practice accomplishes this. Our results include the design of incentive schemes that eliminate or mitigate Parkinson's Law. These schemes apply to projects designed under either traditional Critical Path Method (CPM) planning or modern Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) planning, and are also invulnerable to group strategy. A large-scale computational study validates the resulting benefit to project performance as substantial and also robust across different project characteristics. We also provide what is apparently the first analytical comparison between traditional CPM and modern CCPM planning systems. The incentive schemes we propose are simple and easily implementable. We recognize that performance incentives are structured differently by each organization, but our work provides a flexible basis from which various practical schemes can be designed. © 2020 The Author(s)","Incentive compatibility; Mechanism design; Parkinson's Law; Project management","Computation theory; Economics; Game theory; Machine design; Turnaround time; Computational studies; Critical Chain Project Management; Critical path method; Economic activities; Incentive payments; Non-cooperative game theory; Project characteristics; Project performance; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087303685

Our paper casts doubt on this misconception by examining the dynamics between social media customer complaints and brand service interventions. We find service interventions indeed cause more complaints, yet this increase is driven by service awareness rather than chronic complaining. Due to the publicity and connectivity of social media, customers learn about the new service channel by observing customer service delivery to others—a mechanism that is unique to social media customer service and does not exist for traditional call centers. Importantly, high-quality service reduces future complaints. As a result, proactive customer service is a sound strategy on social media, as long as firms dedicate to service quality. Hence, firms should be less concerned about whether to respond and more focused on how to respond to customer complaints. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","awareness enhancement; chronic complainer; complaint management; customer service; Social media; Twitter","Quality of service; Sales; Active service; Awareness enhancement; Chronic complainer; Complaint management; Customer complaints; Customer-service; Learn+; New services; Service channels; Social media; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120972000

Overlooking or underestimating noncompliance in organizations can result in substantial fines, damage to a company’s reputation, and, ultimately, loss of business. To help alleviate this risk, we explore whether organizations can assess noncompliance by monitoring users’ answers and related mouse cursor movements in an intelligent online questionnaire. Namely, we propose that noncompliant (compared with compliant) individuals will experience more cognitive dissonance on questions about (1) what constitutes noncompliance behavior and (2) what consequences for noncompliance are appropriate. We predict that increased cognitive dissonance in noncompliant individuals will influence their questionnaire responses—as well as their mouse cursor movements—when answering these questions. We collect data to test our hypotheses in a study from individuals who voluntarily chose to cheat on an online task for monetary gain. The results suggest that the responses to these two groups of questions, along with the associated mouse cursor movement, can work together as a low-cost, scalable tool to help assess noncompliance risk. This paper contributes to theory by explaining how people who are noncompliant tend to provide more lenient answers to questions about what constitutes compliance and the consequences of noncompliance. In addition, we show how mouse-cursor deviation provides theoretical insight into the level of cognitive dissonance that users experience, and that users who are noncompliant show greater deviation on compliance and consequence questions. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Regulatory compliance; Risk assessment; Surveys; Cognitive dissonance; Cursor movement; Legal compliance; Low-costs; Management tasks; Mouse cursor; Online questionnaire; Online surveys; Organisational; Users' experiences; Mammals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120934654

In these cases it is important to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions of these algorithms. Motivated by this, we present a novel learningbased Bayesian inference approach for quantifying uncertainty in a prediction. Our approach uses samples drawn from the joint distribution of measurements and predictions to train a generative adversarial network (GAN). Thereafter, given a noisy measurement, we use the generator component of the GAN as a prior in a Bayesian update. By reformulating the resulting high-dimensional posterior sampling problem to the low-dimensional latent space of the GAN, we are able to perform efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) updates. We apply this approach to image classification and image inpainting problems in computer vision and to forward and inverse uncertainty quantification tasks arising in computational physics, and demonstrate how the ability to quantify uncertainty can be used to (a) detect samples that lie outside the distribution of the training samples, (b) quantify the confidence in the prediction, and (c) determine the subsequent measurement within an active learning strategy. © 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and American Statistical Association.","Active learning; Bayesian inference; Generative adversarial network (GAN); Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC); Machine learning; Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); Model order reduction; Uncertainty quantification","Bayesian networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Inference engines; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Uncertainty analysis; Active Learning; Bayesian inference; Generative adversarial network; Hamiltonian monte carlo; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Model order reduction; Network-based; Uncertainty quantifications; Generative adversarial networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118512048

Dealing with contract violations plays an important role in managing projects. The aim of the research is to investigate the impact of trust, analyzed in terms of the goodwill-based and competence-based trust, on both contract and social enforcement after a contract violation. A questionnaire survey, partially based on semi-structured interviews, was used for data collection. All the data is from the Chinese construction industry since it provides a fertile context to explore the research questions. The results show that: 1) reputation is used as social enforcement in practice and the severity of it is reflected by the scope of the disclosure, 2) the two dimensions of trust have opposite influences on the severity of contract and social enforcement via different mediating effects of perceived intentionality. Specifically, goodwill-based trust reduces the severity of enforcement via decreasing perceived intentionality, while competence-based trust increases the severity of enforcement by increasing perceived intentionality. A comprehensive and nuanced understanding for managing contract violation is generated in this research, which will help project managers to manage the contract violation and the interfirm relationships more effectively. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contract enforcement; Contractual breach; perceived intentionality; social enforcement; trust","Construction industry; Chinese construction industry; Construction projects; Contract violation; Inter-firm relationships; Managing projects; Questionnaire surveys; Research questions; Semi structured interviews; Surveys; construction industry; industrial practice; law enforcement; project management; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111638683

Unfortunately, prior studies have paid less attention to how these technologies are affecting sales scholars’ work, such as conducting literature reviews. Our study expands the repertoire of inquiry for sales academics in the domain of AI/ML in three novel ways. First, we offer an efficient process to analyzing the sales literature, through an unsupervised ML-based process, which allows the identification of articles/topics based on semantic similarity rather than based on keywords. Second, we validate our process by applying it to scholarly work published in JPSSM as well as to the practitioner’s literature in the past 40 years. We find that the topics and trends uncovered by our autonomous reader are coherent with previous academic reviews, with some topics being entirely new. We also find that academic research published in JPSSM accurately reflects corporate realities, thereby alleviating concerns about the ‘sales academics-practitioners’ gap. Finally, we provide authors and reviewers with an online application, which allows for rapid identification of related JPSSM articles, and a set of ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) tools, which can help researchers in quickly producing their own literature reviews of articles published in any journal. © 2021 Pi Sigma Epsilon National Educational Foundation.","artificial intelligence; Literature review; machine learning; Python; sales; topic modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108826149

This period reflects the years following the financial crisis of 2008 when mounting criticism emerged that weak corporate governance partly explained The Financial Crisis. It is suggested that the Board of Directors' composition may have played a pivotal role in the Crisis and that Boards that better reflect society perform better. OBJECTIVE: This research examines the impact of gender, age, nationality, and presence of independent directors on firm performance. METHODS: Data on board characteristics were collected from Hemscott, as well as information from the companies' annual reports and financial database FAME. Using the Generalized Method of Moments, the data were assessed to examine board diversity and firm financial performance. RESULTS: This study consists of 456 observations from 76 listed FTSE 100 companies during the period 2010-2015. Twenty-four companies were excluded due to missing data that related to directors' attributes after controlling for firm characteristics, board structure, and potential endogeneity issues, the findings support the business case for gender and nationality board diversity. However, no significant associations were found between firm financial performance and board age diversity or board independence. CONCLUSION: This study, although British based, joins a growing global body of evidence that more diverse boards improve firm performance. It is incumbent on practitioners, decision-makers, and politicians to educate and persuade firms' directors of the merits of more diverse boards. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a panel dataset of 64 Ghanaian insurance brokerage firms spanning 2011–2015. Static [ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effect and random effect and dynamic (two-step generalized method of moments (GMM))] estimation techniques are employed to analyze the data. Findings: The study finds the existence of both economies and diseconomies of scale and scope theories in the Ghanaian insurance brokerage industry confirming the existence of nonlinear nexus between size and performance. This finding is consistent for both stakeholder and shareholder profit performance. Thus, the results show that size improves profitability of insurance brokerage firms, but beyond a certain threshold, the relationship turns negative as size negatively affects profitability. Practical implications: The research findings have implications for both policy and research; the study recommends that Ghanaian brokerage managers should understand that not all growth is good and exercise a duty of care when applying growth strategies by monitoring size effect on performance so as not to go beyond the inflection point. Further research can be done to examine this effect in other contexts, timeframes and jurisdictions. Originality/value: This research is unique in that it employs a panel dataset consisting of 96% of insurance brokerage firms in Ghana whilst employing both static and nonstatic regression models to examine the effect of size. The research analysis adopted is robust, and the findings are significant. Also, the lack of empirical studies on the operations and dealings of auxiliary institutions such as the insurance brokerage firms adds value to this research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavior < L – industrial org; Diversification; Insurance brokerage firms; L25 – firm performance: size; Organization; Profitability; Scope < L2 – firm objectives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107731894

The AIRR approach breaks down project NPV into scale (the capital invested) and economic efficiency (the AIRR), and maintains NPV consistency for accept/reject decisions. Here we examine extensions of the AIRR to risky capital asset projects, a domain where the IRR appears intractable. We show that one can uniquely break down a risky NPV into a risk-sensitive project scale and a risk-sensitive extended AIRR, representing risky project efficiency, so that consistency with NPV for accept/reject decisions is maintained in the certainty-equivalent sense, in direct analogy to the deterministic case. This novel breakdown gives managerial insight by helping determine a risky project’s locus of uncertainty, be it the project scale, or economic efficiency, or both. In this way, risky features of competing projects can be explored in more detail, leading to insights substantiating the NPV ranking. We also show that under risk neutrality, the expected AIRR is equal to the AIRR of the expected cash flow, a property that notoriously fails for the stochastic IRR. © 2021 Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers.",,"Efficiency; Stochastic systems; Capital asset; Certainty equivalent; Economic efficiency; Internal rate of return; Net present value; Project scale; Risk neutrality; Risky projects; Earnings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105996928

This paper aims to propose an Information Security Preparedness Model that was developed to examine how SME executives’ perceptions of security importance, implementation challenges and external influences impact their awareness and commitment to security preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Funded by the Department of Justice, a national survey of SME executives’ perceptions of information security preparedness was conducted. Using PLS-SEM, the survey responses were used to test the proposed Information Security Preparedness Model. Findings: The results indicate that as perceptions of security importance and external influences increase, SME executives’ awareness and commitment to information security also increases. In addition, as implementation challenges increase, awareness and commitment to information security decreases. Finally, as security importance and awareness and commitment to information security increases, executives’ perception of security preparedness also increases. Research limitations/implications: Executive perceptions of information security were measured and not the actual level of security. Further research that examines the agreement between executive perceptions and the true state of information security within the organization is warranted.

Congestion is evidenced when decreases (increases) in some inputs result in increases (decreases) in some outputs without worsening (improving) any other input/output. Most of the existing methods for measuring the congestion of DMUs utilize the traditional definition of congestion and assume that inputs and outputs change with the same proportion. Therefore, the important question that arises is whether congestion will occur or not if the decision maker (DM) increases or decreases the inputs dis-proportionally. This means that, the traditional definition of congestion in DEA may be unable to measure the congestion of units with multiple inputs and outputs. This paper focuses on the directional congestion and proposes methods for recognizing the directional congestion using DEA models. To do this, we consider two different scenarios: (i) just the input direction is available. (ii) none of the input and output directions are available. For each scenario, we propose a method consists in systems of inequalities or linear programming problems for estimation of the directional congestion. The validity of the proposed methods are demonstrated utilizing two numerical examples. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2021.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Decision making units; Directional congestion","Data envelopment analysis; Linear programming; Numerical methods; DEA models; Decision makers; Decision making unit; Input and outputs; Linear programming problem; Multiple inputs and outputs; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102041227

This is a variant of bipartite matching except that advertisers may strategize by choosing their bidding profiles and their total budget. Because the ad network’s allocation rule affects the bidders’ strategies, equilibrium analysis is challenging. We show that this analysis is tractable when advertisers face a linear budget cost rj. In particular, we show that the strategy in which advertisers bid their valuations shaded by a factor of 1 + rj is an approximate equilibrium with the error decreasing with market size. This equilibrium can be interpreted as one in which a bidder facing an opportunity cost rj is guaranteed a return on investment of at least rj per dollar spent. Furthermore, in this equilibrium, the optimal allocation for the ad network, as determined from a linear program (LP), is greedy with high probability.

This research explores the role that emotional solidarity and empowerment play in explaining residents’ involvement in planning for tourism. We collected a sample of 415 residents residing in three counties highly impacted from tourism in Central Florida–Orange, Osceola, and Seminole. Using structural equation modelling, we found that constructs tested in the model, including welcoming nature, sympathetic understanding, social empowerment, and political empowerment, explained 54% of the variance in residents’ involvement in tourism planning. Furthermore, two relationships including the effect of resident emotional closeness on their involvement in tourism planning and the effect of resident psychological empowerment on their involvement in tourism planning were not significant. Interestingly, standardized regression coefficients were stronger for the two social and political empowerment factors in explaining resident involvement in tourism planning than for welcoming nature and sympathetic understanding factors. Our results thus contribute to empirically-rigorous, holistic modelling of residents’ attitudes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emotional closeness; EQS; Florida; Orlando; residents’ empowerment; structural equation modelling; sympathetic understanding; Welcoming nature","ecotourism; empowerment; holistic approach; numerical model; psychology; resident population; tourism management; Florida [United States]; Orange County [Florida]; Osceola County [Florida]; Seminole County [Florida]; United States; Citrus sinensis; Florida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101110775

However, most postmarket studies have not been completed as promised. We address this noncompliance problem. Academic/practical relevance: The prevalence of this noncompliance problem poses considerable public health risk, thus compromising the original purpose of a well-intentioned AP initiative. We provide an internally consistent and implementable solution to the problem through a comprehensive analysis of the myriad complicating factors and trade-offs facing the FDA. Methodology: We adopt a Stackelberg framework in which the regulator, which cannot observe the manufacturer’s private cost information or level of effort, leads by imposing a postmarket study deadline. The profit-maximizing manufacturer then follows by establishing its level of effort to invest in its postmarket study. In establishing its deadline, the regulator optimizes the trade-off between providing public access to potentially effective drugs and mitigating public health risks from ineffective drugs. Results: We develop a deadline-dependent user fee menu as a screening mechanism that establishes an incentive for manufacturer compliance. We show that its effectiveness in inducing compliance depends fundamentally on the enforceability of sanction, a drug-specific measure that indicates how difficult it is to withdraw an unproven drug from the market, and the drug’s success probability: The higher either is, the higher is the probability that the mechanism induces compliance. Managerial implications: We synthesize and distill the salient tradeoffs and nuances facing the FDA’s noncompliance problem and provide an implementable solution. We quantify the value of the solution as a function of a drug’s success probability and enforceability. From a public policy perspective, we provide guidance for the FDA to increase the viability and effectiveness of AP.

Building on recent work, we provide a coherent framework for constructing DFS portfolios where we explicitly model the behavior of other DFS players. We formulate an optimization problem that accurately describes the DFS problem for a risk-neutral decision maker in both double-up and top-heavy payoff settings. Our formulation maximizes the expected reward subject to feasibility constraints, and we relate this formulation to mean-variance optimization and the outperformance of stochastic benchmarks. Using this connection, we show how the problem can be reduced to the problem of solving a series of binary quadratic programs. We also propose an algorithm for solving the problem where the decision maker can submit multiple entries to the DFS contest. This algorithm is motivated by submodularity properties of the objective function and by some new results on parimutuel betting. One of the contributions of our work is the introduction of a Dirichlet-multinomial data-generating process for modeling opponents’ team selections, and we estimate the parameters of this model via Dirichlet regressions. A further benefit to modeling opponents’ team selections is that it enables us to estimate the value, in a DFS setting, of both insider trading and collusion. We demonstrate the value of our framework by applying it to DFS contests during the 2017 National Football League season.

Although there are consequences for unnecessarily canceling flights (i.e., displaced passengers, lost revenue, etc.), any benefits associated with such cancellations are best realized if made early, often before any traffic flow rate limitation is imposed. This paper proposes a framework for optimizing an adaptive decision strategy based on the evolution of the forecast uncertainty. Using an ensemble forecast, a scenario tree is generated to highlight both key planning scenarios and the likelihood of these scenarios developing over the forecast horizon. By aligning decision points at the initial and intermediary nodes in the tree, the recommended flight cancellations and cancellation timing are optimized for minimum expected cost with respect to the forecast uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied to a case day and analyzes the recommended cancellations across the forecast horizon against different predicted scenarios. The results demonstrate that by directly planning for future strategy adaptation lower costs are incurred earlier, when a higher degree of uncertainty exists, as compared with decisions based on a single decision point. © 2020, AIAA International.

Utilizing publicly available big data related to the construction labor market and postdisaster infrastructure repair expenditures, this study seeks to (1) measure construction labor demand surge in the highways, roads, and bridges construction sector following federally-declared disasters in US metro-areas and (2) identify when such postdisaster demand surge occurs. A total of 118 US metro-areas were analyzed for demand surge following federally-declared disaster events from 2004 to 2017. Findings highlight inflated postdisaster construction labor wages in metro-areas, with the demand surge spiking within six months after a disaster. This data-driven study is the first to quantitatively measure postdisaster demand surge in the US highways, roads, and bridges sector following multihazard disaster events.

We used salary survey data from the Project Management Institute and multi-national pay data to investigate the relationships among human capital variables, national policy, salaries, and gender wage gaps. The results showed the project management profession consistently has a narrower gender wage gap than the national gender wage gaps. Using ANOVA and mediation models, we showed that the project management gender wage gap can be reduced in the presence of national anti-discriminatory laws and national human capital development – both of which raise women's salaries to reduce the gender wage gap among project managers in Westernized countries. However, the human capital theory did not apply to the gender wage gap among project managers in Non-western contexts. Other recommendations to reduce gender wage gaps include national and organizational policies such as prohibiting discrimination against women in hiring practices, skills training, career development, and educational opportunities. We concluded there is still more work to be done to achieve equal pay between men and women, even in the project management profession and especially in Non-western contexts. © 2020","Female labor force participation; Gender wage gap; Human capital; National policy; Project managers","Employment; Managers; Project management; Surveys; Career development; Educational opportunities; Hiring practices; Human capital development; Human capital theories; National policies; Organizational policies; Project managers; Wages; gender disparity; human capital; labor participation; labor policy; project management; wage gap; womens employment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092256112

The distribution of extended warranties through an intermediary can be characterized in terms of two basic forms. A large proportion of retailers sell their own extended warranty, whilst others choose to resell the extended warranty provided by upstream agents. Several questions arise from these conditions. How will optimum decisions vary under different strategic choice? Is it profitable for a retailer to engage in selling extended warranties? And finally, which strategy is more profitable for related players? We answer these questions using a game theoretic model where the retailer has the flexibility to choose between offering its own extended warranties (Model ER) or reselling extended warranties provided by a manufacturer (Model EM). Our analysis reveals that it is indeed a profitable business for both parties when the retailer engages in selling extended warranty, irrespective of whether they are owned by the retailer or by the manufacturer. Surprisingly, we find that, when marketing cost of the extended warranty is high, the retailer benefits more from reselling the extended warranty, a strategy that is always beneficial for the manufacturer. Put differently, when marketing cost of the extended warranty is high, reselling extended warranties from the manufacturer can secure Pareto improvements. However, when marketing cost of the extended warranty is not pronounced, a preference confliction arises between both parties: The retailer prefers to sell its own extended warranty, while the manufacturer would be fond of the other one. Extending both models to the case where the manufacturer encroaches into retail market with selling both products and extended warranty reveals that the preference confliction between both parties is quite robust. © Operational Research Society 2020.","E-commerce; extended warranty; game theory; supplier encroachment; Supply chain","Commerce; Game theory; Manufacture; Profitability; Brand names; Extended warranties; Game-theoretic model; Optimum decision; Pareto improvements; Product markets; Retail market; Strategic choice; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087634906

Managing the availability of the parts in the supply chain to ensure uninterrupted operation of the system is non-trivial and can be costly in terms of capital and resources. A DMSMS (Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages) issue is the loss, or impending loss, of a manufacturer because the manufacturer discontinues production or support of needed parts. Proactive DMSMS requires the ability to forecast part availability in the marketplace under varying conditions. This paper goes beyond part-level forecasting by developing a framework to estimate availability risk at the system level. The proposed framework quantifies and compares availability risk for multiple parts in a system using a finite-source capacitated queuing model. Two availability risk metrics are defined: the fraction of time with no vendor parts available and the time until a part will be unavailable in the market. The metrics are demonstrated in scenarios that a DMSMS practitioner is likely to experience. The results demonstrate that the framework can be used to inform proactive DMSMS decisions by providing a measurement of the risk in the logistics system which supports cost and resource allocation trade-offs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Availability risk; diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS); finite-source capacitated queuing model; obsolescence","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Obsolescence; Queueing theory; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Supply chains; diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS); Enterprise system; Finite sources; Logistics system; Product lifetime; Queuing models; System lifetimes; Uninterrupted operations; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082953957

In OR we aspire to be logical, and therefore our behaviours should be relatively easy to replicate in logic, the basis of computer systems. We also pride ourselves on our attention to context, our project management skills, and our pragmatic approach. To think about the issues, we can turn to our experience of practicing OR and to the insights of mathematics, philosophy, sociology, and economics. Mathematicians and philosophers have widened the scope of logic to cover many aspects of decision-making; sociologists have conducted research into the social context and consequences of new technologies and economists have analysed their rates of penetration. Some OR jobs will be destroyed and others will be created giving rise to new, more varied career paths. The paper concludes that the centre of gravity of OR practice will move from analysis to those aspects difficult to computerise, the ‘residuals’. When AI does finally displace OR practitioners, it may come in the form of ‘AI strong enough for OR’, strong enough to satisfy potential OR clients in terms of efficacy and cost.

Data was collected and Earned Value analysis was used to compare the performance of both sides over the life of the subcontract. The study showed measurable benefits in terms of productivity and project progress through the implementation of TQM. Applying TQM through integrated management, better communication and involvement of all participants resulted in an increase of productivity up to 3%.

Consumer trials are influenced by past purchases, the inherent appeal of the products, and the ranking of each product. Consumer purchases conditional on trying the product are dependent on the inherent quality for the given consumer segment. The platform owner needs to devise a ranking policy to display the products to maximize the number of purchases in the long run, and to decide whether to display the number of past purchases. The model proposed attempts to understand the impact of market segmentation in a trial-offer market with position bias and social influence. Under our model, consumer choices are based on a very general choice model known as the mixed multinomial logit model, which embeds product appeal, ranking, and past purchases into the taste parameters. We analyze the long-term dynamics of this highly complex stochastic model and we quantify the expected benefits of market segmentation as well as the value of social influence. When past purchases are displayed, consumer heterogeneity makes buyers try the sub-optimal products, reducing the overall sales rate. We show that consumer heterogeneity makes the ranking problem NP-hard. We then analyze the benefits of market segmentation. We find tight bounds to the expected benefits of offering a distinct ranking to each consumer segment. Finally, we show that the market segmentation strategy always benefits from social influence when the average quality ranking is used. One of the managerial implications is that the firm is better off using an aggregate ranking policy when the variety of consumer preference is limited, but it should perform a market segmentation policy when consumers are highly heterogeneous. We also show that this result is robust to relatively small consumer classification mistakes; when these are large, an aggregate ranking is preferred. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Market segmentation; OR in marketing; Ranking policies; Revenue management; Social influence","Aggregates; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Purchasing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Aggregate ranking; Consumer purchase; Consumer segments; Market segmentation; Multiple products; Online platforms; OR in marketing; Ranking policy; Revenue management; Social influence; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111041662

While a growing body of evidence shows that such procedures can be highly accurate, limited research has evaluated how well decision-makers can execute the prescriptive recommendations of aids based on such strategies in practice. Drawing on the behavioural, neuropsychological and decision-analytic literatures, we propose that an alignment between individual, model and task features will influence the effectiveness with which decision-makers can execute strategies that draw on prescriptive psychological heuristics – “fast and frugal” or otherwise. Our findings suggest that strategy execution is highly sensitive to task characteristics however, the effects of the number of alternatives and attributes on individuals’ ability to deploy a given strategy, differ in magnitude and direction depending on which decision-strategy is prescribed. A more compensatory decision-style positively affected overall task performance. Subjects’ ability to regulate inhibitory control was found to positively affect non-compensatory strategy execution, while having no discernible bearing on comparable compensatory tasks. Our findings reinforce that rather than an aspect of the prescriptive model, synergies between individual, model and task features are more instrumental in driving task performance in aided MCDM contexts. We discuss these findings in light of calls from OR scholars for the development of decision-aids that draw on prescriptive “fast and frugal” principles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioural OR; Compatibility effects; Executive function; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Psychological heuristics","Decision making; Decision theory; Operations research; Behavioral OR; Compatibility effect; Decision makers; Decision process; Executive function; Individual modeling; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Psychological heuristic; Strategy execution; Task performance; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106634325

The investor earns stochastic labour income with both permanent and temporary shocks, and has access to equity, conventional bond, inflation-indexed bond and cash, as well as two types of deferred annuities: nominal and inflation-protected. The objective function consists of power utility in terms of real retirement income from the annuities as well as bequest from remaining wealth in tradable securities. Asset returns are represented by a vector autoregressive model underpinned by Nelson–Siegel real and nominal yield curves. The optimization problem is solved numerically using multi-stage stochastic programming with a hybrid scenario structure combining a scenario tree with scenario fans. Our numerical results show that deferred annuities are bought early and in increasing amounts during the working lifetime of the investor, with portfolio risk declining with age. Welfare is diminished by 40% if deferred annuities are not available. Inflation-protected deferred annuities are marginally more important in the presence of real labour income risk, but nominal deferred annuities are bought as a cheaper alternative if real yields are low or negative.

Over the recent years, advanced metering infrastructure has proliferated in industry. This has given rise to many load forecasting methods based on frequent measurements of power states obtained by smart meters. Meanwhile, real-world constraints arising in this new setting present both challenges and opportunities to achieve high load forecastability. The bandwidth constraints often imposed on the transmission between data concentrators and utilities are one of them, which limit the amount of data that can be sampled from customers. There lacks a sampling-rate control policy that is self-adaptive to users’ load behaviors through online data interaction with the smart grid environment. In this paper, we formulate the bandwidth-constrained sampling-rate control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and provide a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to solve the MDP for an optimal sampling-rate control policy. The resulting policy can be updated in real time to accommodate volatile load behaviors observed in the smart grid. Numerical experiments show that the proposed RL-based algorithm outperforms competing algorithms and delivers superior predictive performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; Machine learning; Markov decision processes; Reinforcement learning; Sampling-rate control","Bandwidth; Behavioral research; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Smart power grids; Control policy; Load behavior; Load forecasting; Machine-learning; Markov Decision Processes; Rate controls; Reinforcement learnings; Sampling rates; Sampling-rate control; Smart grid; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103991306

However, currently SAF cannot be produced at competitive prices relative to petroleum-based jet fuel. Pennycress is a crop whose oilseed could be used as a relatively low-cost feedstock to produce SAF, potentially benefiting farmers and the environment. This stochastic techno-economic analysis (TEA) studies an enterprise buying pennycress oilseed from farmers, extracting the bio-oil and selling it to a biorefinery that converts bio-oil into SAF. Maximum buying prices (MBP)—prices that yield a zero net present value—the crushing enterprise could pay farmers for pennycress oilseed are estimated. To conduct the analysis, discount rates are estimated based on financial data of biofuel firms, thus providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate profitability and feedstock buying prices. Estimated risk-adjusted discount rates vary between 12 and 17%, above rates typically used in similar valuations. Estimated stochastic MBP range between 10.18 and 11.73 ¢ pound−1, which is below the price at which farmers are willing to plant pennycress, according to recent research. By considering the crushing facility’s inherent cash flow structure and risk, the distributions of stochastic modified internal rate of return suggest the crushing enterprise could be economically attractive at a 14% discount rate, our most likely estimate. However, between 11 and 17% times the cash flow model is simulated, the firm falls under financial distress. Overall, the findings suggest potential barriers for deployment of a SAF supply chain without governmental incentives or related policies.

Yet, these studies succumbed to the conventional pitfall of assuming that consumers write reviews only after they fully read the book that they purchased. A recent industry report revealed that although many individuals initiate book reading, only a few finish them. With these considerations in mind, we investigated how consumers’ book-consumption patterns affect their review behaviors and how reviews generated from incomplete consumption influence subsequent sales. We used expectation confirmation theory (ECT) as a theoretical foundation to elaborate on the review behaviors of consumers at various stages of their e-book consumption. On the basis of ECT, we argue that customers can submit reviews not necessarily after full consumption, but at any point during this trajectory, and even when consumption has yet to take place. Consumption patterns were traced and captured from records of reading activities on e-book devices and apps. Our results indicate that a considerable number of consumers provide positive reviews even before initiating reading or after progressing up to an extremely early section of a book. In addition, the relationship between review valence and completion rate can be characterized as a U-shaped pattern, given that reviews arising from negative disconfirmations occur more frequently than those emerging out of positive disconfirmations. The findings also uncover that customers occupying the extreme ends of the completion continuum provide less extreme review ratings. The effect of completion rate on review length is significantly positive. Our text-analysis results suggest that reviews based on sufficient consumption contain more useful insights than do those grounded in incomplete consumption. Moreover, review comments formed after incomplete consumption adversely affect subsequent sales. Finally, we discuss a number of our findings’ implications and provide actionable recommendations that can aid platforms in their efforts to refine their online-review systems and policies in pursuit of enhanced credibility in peer evaluation. © 2021 INFORMS","consumption rate; digital content consumption; incomplete consumption; information good; online review; review quality","Consumer behavior; Online systems; Sales; Consumption patterns; Consumption rates; Content consumption; Digital content consumption; Digital contents; Expectation Confirmation Theory; Incomplete consumption; Information goods; Online reviews; Review quality; Reviews",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134693641

A hierarchical Bayesian model, using a unique data set from a leading electronic shopping platform and a simulated experiment, reveals that in the early phases of the purchase funnel, consumers are more likely to click on extremely priced options (i.e., the highest or lowest), which consumers use as anchors to evaluate the broad range of options. Later in the purchase funnel, when clicks tend to convert to purchases, consumers instead are more likely to click on moderately priced options, which usually offer a compromise between price and quality. The effects of price rank diminish among adver­tisements that sponsor more specific keywords and increase among those that sponsor more popular keywords. These findings provide new insights into the role of price information in the PLA context, as well as managerial implications for devising effective PLA strategies. © 2021 INFORMS","click-through rate; consumer purchase funnel; conversion rate; keyword popularity; keyword specificity; price rank; product list advertising","Decision making; Purchasing; Sales; Advertizing; Clickthrough rates (CTR); Consumer purchase; Consumer purchase funnel; Conversion rates; Keyword popularity; Keyword specificity; Price information; Price rank; Product list advertizing; Bayesian networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134645676

Under CFS, consumers waive the shipping surcharge if the order exceeds a certain threshold, whereas under MFS, consumers pay an upfront fee and enjoy the free-shipping perk throughout the membership period. We develop a stylized model that considers consumer heterogeneity in two dimensions: (1) disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product—a product that consumers would not otherwise purchase—to qualify for CFS; and (2) shopping frequency over a given period. Our analysis suggests that the introduction of MFS allows the e-tailer to segment the market further, which could lead to a higher product price. When the disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product is moderate, the e-tailer should charge a high membership fee to target only frequent shoppers who forgo CFS. However, the e-tailer should lower the fee to lure also (1) frequent shoppers who would otherwise take CFS, when the disutility is high; or (2) infrequent shoppers who would otherwise forgo CFS, when the disutility is low. In all cases, although the collected fee revenue can never compensate for the cost arising from offering the free-shipping perk, the loss can be recouped as a desirable outcome of a more segmented market. Our research generates insights into the optimal design of e-tailers’ shipping policies, shedding light on the practical challenges that confront e-tailers. © 2021 INFORMS","contingent free shipping; electronic commerce; free shipping; price discrimination; segmentation","Electronic commerce; Ships; Contingent free shipping; E-tailers; Economic impacts; Free shipping; Membership fees; Price discrimination; Product price; Segmentation; Two-dimensions; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134637298

One of the key factors that affects the quality of cloud services is congestion, and it has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Congestion leads to a potential loss of end users (e.g., riders and drivers of Uber), thereby adversely affecting the demand for cloud services. Discount has been a useful mean to stimulate demand and reward customer loyalty. However, in the presence of congestion, the effect of discount on demand is ambiguous. On the one hand, a higher discount leads to higher demand; on the other hand, higher demand can lead to higher congestion, thereby lowering the demand. Given that end users are both price and congestion sensitive, the choice of optimal discount under congestion is, therefore, not straightforward. Using a game-theoretic model, we study the dynamics between congestion and discount and explore how congestion moderates both the buyer’s and seller’s optimal decisions. Our results show that the buyer is not necessarily worse off even when the end users are more intolerant to congestion. In fact, we find that when end users are more congestion sensitive, the demand of cloud services can actually sometimes increase, and the discount offered by the seller can decrease. These findings have important managerial implications on the seller’s pricing and capacity decisions. We also observe that a lower cost of technology can sometimes hurt the buyer, and the buyer can pass on lower benefits to end users. Moreover, given that the cloud services are prone to disruptions, a buyer sources from multiple cloud vendors, which further complicates the matter. We draw useful insights about the buyer’s procurement decisions under congestion in a multicloud setup. © 2021 INFORMS","cloud computing; congestion; game theory; pricing; quantity discount","Computation theory; Computer games; Costs; Distributed database systems; Sales; Web services; Amazon web services; Cloud services; Cloud-computing; Congestion; End-users; Game-theoretic; High demand; Key factors; Potential loss; Quantity discount; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129690119

Although the existence of this tension is generally accepted, less understood is the mechanism that underlies it. We show that no arbitrage along with the rich information in the cross section of yields has strong implications for both the dynamics of volatility and the forecasts of yields. We show that this link implied by the absence of arbitrage-and not the factor structure per se-underlies the tension between first and second moments found in the literature. Adding to recent research that has suggested that no-arbitrage restrictions are nearly irrelevant in Gaussian DTSMs, our results show that no-arbitrage restrictions are potentially relevant when there is stochastic volatility. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

When employees can use their own discretion, which may be influenced by personal preferences, to select a supplier, the incentives of the employees and the organization may be misaligned. Disclosing information about previous purchasing decisions made by other employees can reduce or exacerbate this misalignment, as peer effects may come into play. To understand the effects of transparency, we introduce a theoretical model that compares employees' actions in two settings: One where employees cannot observe each other's choices and one where they can observe the decision previously made by a peer before making their own. Two behavioral assumptions are central to our model: That employees are heterogeneous in their reciprocity toward their employer, and that they experience peer effects in the form of income inequality aversion toward their peer. As a result, our model predicts the existence of negative spillovers as a reciprocal employee is more likely to choose the expensive supplier (which gives the employee a personal reward) when the employee observes that a peer did so. A laboratory experiment confirms the existence of negative spillovers and the main behavioral mechanisms described in our model. A surprising result not predicted by our theory is that employees whose decisions are observed by their peers are less likely to choose the expensive supplier than the employees in the no-transparency case. We show that observed employees' preferences for compliance with the social norm of appropriate purchasing behavior explain our data well. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Furthermore, a review of the fair AI and philosophical literature demonstrates the unsuitability of ‘treat like cases alike’ and other intuitive notions as conceptions of fairness. That review then generates three desiderata for a replacement conception of fairness valuable to AI research: (1) It must provide a meta-theory for understanding tradeoffs, entailing that it must be flexible enough to capture diverse species of objection to decisions. (2) It must not appeal to an impartial perspective (neutral data, objective data, or final arbiter.) (3) It must foreground the way in which judgments of fairness are sensitive to context, i.e., to historical and institutional states of affairs. We argue that a conception of fairness as appropriate concession in the historical iteration of institutional decisions meets these three desiderata. On the basis of this definition, we organize the insights of commentators into a process-structure map of the ethical territory that we hope will bring clarity to computer scientists and ethicists analyzing Fair AI while clearing some ground for further technical and philosophical work. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","AI; Ethics; Fairness; History; Medical AI","artificial intelligence; decision making; morality; Artificial Intelligence; Judgment; Morals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119682858

DLFM is parsimonious and dependent on a much smaller data set that needs to be updated regularly but technically and computationally more complicated, especially when there are mixed-frequency data. On the other hand, MIDAS is data-intensive but computationally more tractable. The analysis is done through a comparison of forecast performance measures (such as mean absolute prediction error) and application of statistical tests of comparative predictive accuracy and tests of forecast encompassing. Results obtained so far indicate that just about every method in the pool of forecasting methods studied performs best in some cases and worst in other cases. Thus, there is no clear winner. Furthermore, combining forecasts from the alternative methods, especially using least squares weights, improves forecast accuracy, and therefore is advocated for use in practice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Indian Econometric Society.","ARDL; Combining forecasts; Dynamic latent factor model; Elastic net; Factor analysis; Forecasting; MIDAS; Nowcasting; Principal components; VAR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119207744

The specific scope of the study is pair programming. The study aims to discover whether intra-pair communication in pair programming has a significant impact on the pair programming process and output. Literature review: Many of the pair programming communication studies are descriptive and qualitative studies whose foci lay more on communication contents and alternative message deliveries. As a result, more research that focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of a person's communication skill level while performing a demanding task is needed. Research question: Does the communication competency level significantly impact pair programming output? Methodology: A pool of novice university programming students was deployed for the experiment. The Conversational Skills Rating Scale (CSRS) was used to categorize them into three cohorts-""high-high,' 'high-low,' and 'low-low.' The confounding variables were controlled. Results: No significant difference was found among the three cohorts in terms of their pair programming code output. Additionally, the post-experiment questionnaire responses revealed no significant difference in compatibility and confidence levels, but did show a significant difference in communication level. Conclusion: With all things being equal, a programmer's high communication skill level doesn't play a significant role in the programming output in a pair programming setting. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Communication; Communication competency; Pair programming","Encoding (symbols); Personnel training; Problem solving; Signal encoding; Code; Communication competency; Communication skills; Encodings; High output; Pair-programming; Problem-solving; Programming profession; Receiver; Skill levels; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117323557

Replacing the erratic daily death counts U.S. states initially reported with counts based on death certificate date, we build a week-ahead statistical forecasting model that explains most of their daily variation (R2 = 0.97) and isolates COVID-19’s TRP (p &lt; 0.001). These counts, normalized at 31 °C (U.S. mid-summer average), scale up to 160% at 5 °C in the static case where the infection pool is held constant. Positive case counts are substantially more temperature sensitive. When temperatures are declining, dynamic feedback through a growing infection pool can substantially amplify these temperature effects. Our estimated TRP can be incorporated into COVID-related planning exercises and used as an input to SEIR models employed for longer run forecasting. For the former, we show how our TRP is predictive of the realized pattern of growth rates in per capita positive cases across states five months after the end of our sample period.

Drawing on debates on industrial composition and industrial dualism, I argue that a key driver of falling wage growth and inflation has been the growing share of employment in “stagnant services”: those with limited productivity growth, competitive product markets, and thin profit margins. In these services, it is difficult to raise wages and prices. I use these insights to revisit Baumol's cost disease theory, arguing that weak wage growth in stagnant services has spilled over to other sectors with more room for wage growth, resulting in the gradual disinflation observed in recent decades. Using graphical plots and error correction models of nominal wage growth and inflation in 21 advanced economies from 1972-2009, the analysis shows that employment growth in stagnant services over this period was associated with a reduction of nominal wage growth and inflation by more than half. Without deep changes in stagnant services, slow wage and price growth are here to stay. © 2021","inflation; services; structural change; wage growth","competitiveness; employment generation; inflation; productivity; profitability; structural change; wage determination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114772446

This article examines why and how new collaborative mechanisms have emerged in practice, and with what effect on socio-environmental dynamics in communities under pressure from the impacts of mining and climate change. The research is based on qualitative fieldwork among civil society, the private sector, and the public sector near the Escondida, Los Pelambres, and Andina mines in Chile, as well as among national-level representatives of each of these stakeholder groups in Santiago. Results indicate that companies’ discursive emphasis on collaboration reflects actual changes in industry practice that are an improvement of community relations methods. However, the ways this collaboration is currently carried out may result in a transformation and displacement of harms at the root of conflict, rather than permanent solutions to them. Whether, how, and where harms are transformed and displaced depend upon the interaction of geographical and social factors, with the negative impacts of mining tending to flow downstream and/or from more powerful to less powerful communities. These findings are conceptualized in a framework of “hydrosocial displacements,” which adds explanatory and predictive capacity to scholarship in political ecology on the hydrosocial cycle. In addition, the framework offers a policy tool for stakeholders to assess the context of water conflicts and achieve solutions—rather than displacements—of their causes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chile; Climate change; Community relations; Extractive industries; Latin America; Water","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Water; Chile; Community relations; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental dynamics; Extractive industry; Latin America; License to operate; Over water; Shared values; Water conflict; Climate change; climate change; conceptual framework; corporate social responsibility; displacement; mining; resource management; water management; Chile; Metropolitana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113165155

Although the expected return of a diversified portfolio is the weighted average return of its constituent parts, the variance of the portfolio is less than the weighted average variance of its constituent parts. Our results suggest that very few people have correct statistical intuitions about the effects of diversification. The average person in our data sees no benefit of diversification in terms of reducing portfolio volatility. Many people, especially those low in financial literacy, believe diversification actually increases the volatility of a portfolio. These people seem to believe that the unpredictability of individual assets compounds when aggregated together. Additionally, most people believe diversification increases the expected return of a portfolio. Many of these people correctly link diversification with the concept of risk reduction but seem to understand risk reduction to mean greater returns on average. We show that these beliefs can lead people to construct investment portfolios that mismatch investors’ risk preferences. Furthermore, these beliefs may help explain why many investors are underdiversified. © 2021 INFORMS.","Decision making; Diversification; Financial decision making; Investing; Judgment; Numerical cognition","Behavioral research; Statistical methods; Decisions makings; Diversification; Expected return; Financial decision making; Financial decisions; Investing; Judgment; Numerical cognition; Weighted averages; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110800369

Since the interests of both parties might not be aligned, we propose a proper scoring rule to elicit the expert's forecast that is tailored to the decision problem the newsvendor faces. Under the proposed scoring rule, both the newsvendor's expected profit and the expert's expected payment increase as the expert exerts a higher effort when gathering information to formulate a forecast. Trust issues arise in this setting because the ex post payment the expert receives is contingent on the accuracy of the reported forecast, which in turn depends on a future realized outcome that might be only available to the newsvendor. We show that coding the proposed proper scoring rule as a blockchain-based smart contract allows the newsvendor to signal trustworthiness while, at the same time, inducing the expert to devote more effort in information gathering. Following the design science research framework, we conclude the paper by suggesting a design and a fully functional prototype of a blockchain-based smart contract that implements the proposed tailored proper scoring rule. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Forecasting; Newsvendor; Proper scoring rules; Smart contracts","Forecasting; Decision problems; Demand forecast; Design-science researches; Expected profits; Functional Prototypes; Information gathering; Inventory levels; Proper scoring rules; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109098168

Can ML deliver better algorithmic rules than traditional simple legal rules? This paper argues that the answer to these question is “no” by building an argument based on three increasingly more serious barriers that ML faces to develop legal (or quasi-legal) algorithmic rules: data availability, the Lucas’ critique, and incentive compatibility in eliciting information. Thus, the case for simple legal rules is still sound even in a world with ML. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; D85; Economics; H10; H30; Machine learning; Simple rules",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101205434

We use a direct measure of sunk costs, player compensation, and a quasi-experimental method that considers the endogenous relationship between compensation and productivity. Using the spike in salary cap for the 2016–2017 season, from new television broadcasting contracts, we find compensation has a significant effect on playing time. Specifically, we use players signing free agent contracts in 2015–2016 or 2016–2017. For both groups, we analyze the change in salary from the pre-contract season to the post-contract season. Using the difference-in-differences, we find the inflated salary cap, from the new television contracts, increased player compensation by 81.7%, on average. Instrumental variables estimations show the increase in compensation significantly affects playing time. The change in salary yields an additional 1.93 min played per game, which is approximately equal to the effect of a one-standard deviation increase in contemporaneous productivity. Furthermore, we find that our conclusions are robust to the use of various advanced analytical measures or traditional box-score statistics. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Compensation; National Basketball Association; Playing time; Sunk cost","compensation system; experimental study; income distribution; inflation; productivity; sport; television; wage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098631172

The accessibility of explicit interaction of decision makers at a single platform in the form of embedded group decision environment is a great impediment to the researchers. Accordingly, this research aims to tailor a novel alternative system of dealing with the embedded group decision under a remote group decision environment via integrating MACBETH and Exploratory Factor Analysis. The study finds that an embedded remote group decision making system could serve as an alternative system of group decision making which has plentiful perks in group decision applications. This system could help researchers to carry out research without confusing in embedded group decision environment but including all decision-makers in the model.

A total of 254 complete samples were collected for our hypotheses test. Findings: The results confirm the overall significant roles of IT capabilities in the three agile capabilities. The results further reveal that the IT capability for knowledge management has a higher influence on sensing capability, while the IT capability for process integration has a higher influence on responding capability. Moreover, strategic decision and responding capabilities are more important in the high market competition. However, in the low market competition, sensing capability becomes more important while responding capability demonstrates a negative impact on firm performance. Originality/value: This study helps both academics and practitioners better understand a firm's IT-agility-performance mechanism.

The theory of planned behavior (TPB) served as the theoretical foundation and included perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The study also examined the effect of passengers' privacy concerns on their behavioral intentions and assessed the moderating influence of privacy on the influencing factors. Following a quantitative method, 689 participants responded to an online survey while data analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM). Attitudes and subjective norms were found to significantly influence passengers’ behavioral intentions to use biometrics. However, perceived behavioral control (PBC), as well as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use did not have a significant effect on intentions. Four of the six hypotheses involving privacy concerns were supported. Of the five hypotheses proposed to assess the moderating role of privacy, three were supported. However, since the effect sizes were small, the final model did not include the moderation effects. The final model was found to account for 80.2% of the variance in intentions and 35.2% of the variance in privacy concerns.

In detail, this study covers four major types of paper products in the Chinese market: newsprint, printing paper, household paper, and packaging paper. The developments of Internet technologies were decomposed into two aspects: the communication technology (CT) and the software platform technology (PT). Granger causality analysis was employed to determine whether the consumption pattern of paper products was affected by the development of the Internet. Furthermore, impulse-response analyses were utilized to measure how the consumption pattern of each paper product was shaped by the development of each aspect of Internet technologies, i.e., CT or PT. The empirical results suggested that the Internet developments are causing the consumption patterns shifts of all four paper products. Specifically, the consumptions of newsprint and printing paper were driven by both CT and PT. However, the consumptions of packaging paper and household paper were driven by the PT only. Compared to the development of CT, we found that the quick evolution of PT plays a more significant role in shifting people's consumption of paper products in China.

A substantial literature argues that foreign investment may be underprovided, because governments cannot offer credible guarantees that judicial institutions are impartial and that investors will be able to fairly resolve disputes with business partners and enforce contracts. This time inconsistency problem deters profitable business partnerships between foreign investors and domestic firms in the host country. Consequently, for emerging market leaders seeking to deepen their countries’ integration into global value chains (GVCs), enhancing the confidence of investors in contracting institutions is critical. In this paper, we study the emerging market of Vietnam to examine which type of reassurance mechanism is most successful. Using a survey of 1,583 foreign firms, we inform investors about either a domestic law or international treaty designed to strengthen commercial arbitration procedures. We find that priming foreign firms about the international investment agreement has a larger positive impact on their views about the future profitability of their projects and the likelihood of contracting with other firms in GVCs than simply learning about the commitments in domestic law. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","BITs; commercial arbitration; dispute settlement; foreign direct investment; global value chains; investment protection; ISDS; PTAs; Vietnam, Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CP-TPP)","dispute resolution; foreign direct investment; industrial investment; international agreement; investment; literature review; partnership approach; profitability; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101824869

To support sustainable industry development, it is important to understand which attributes of ‘sustainability’ are most valued by customers, and how those values translate to their willingness to pay a premium for sustainably produced goods. This study surveyed 630 hard apple cider consumers residing in the US Mid-Atlantic region. By using the best-worst choice approach, we presented a two-tiered method which estimated a hierarchal relationship among sustainability attributes that affects a cider consumer's intention to purchase at different price points. ‘Local’ and ‘organic’ held the largest utility and were both highly valued attributes, where consumers will be willing to pay a $10.05 and $6.39 premium, respectively. Agricultural management practices, ‘IPM’ and ‘supporting biodiversity restoration,’ had a positive impact on consumer perception, and commanded a premium of $5.81 and $5.68 respectively. While 'eco-conscious packaging' and 'using renewable energy' did not show substantial utility to the consumer, respondents were still willing to pay a premium for these attributes. Social responsibility attribute levels showed negative utility, however, our analysis found that consumers were still willing to pay a premium of $5.89 for 'charitable donations' and $7.49 for 'community volunteering'. This analysis points to a key challenge in consumer behavior research: the attitude-behavior gap. Effective communication of the specific actions and inactions that take place in sustainable management practices is necessary to convey the proper message to potential consumers. By bridging this gap, hard apple cider producers can better position their product, convey important environmental information for agricultural and business management, and have consumers value their products in a way that make the additional resources allocations to incorporate sustainability metrics prudent in terms of enhanced product profitability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Best worst scaling; Consumer survey; Hard apple cider; Sustainable attributes; Willingness to pay","Alcoholic beverages; Biodiversity; Consumer behavior; Environmental management; Fruits; Information management; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Apple ciders; Apple orchards; Best-worst scaling; Beverage industry; Consumer survey; Hard apple cider; Industry development; Sustainable attribute; Sustainable industries; Willingness to pay; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111929491

Content preferences are defined over latent topics that describe the content of search queries and search result descriptions. Compared with existing applications of topic modeling in marketing and recommendation systems, our proposed approach can simultaneously capture multiple types of information and investigate multiple aspects of behavioral dynamics in a single framework that enables interpretable results for business decision making. To facilitate efficient and scalable inference, we develop a full Bayesian variational inference algorithm. We evaluate our modeling framework using real-world search data for TV shows from the Bing search engine. We illustrate how our model can quantify the content preferences associated with each query and how these preferences vary systematically based on whether the query is observed before, during, or after a TV show is aired. We also show that our model can help the search engine improve its ranking of search results as well as address the cold-start problem for new page links.

Researchers have begun to explore new ways of preventing these incidents by developing and testing leading indicators, precursor analysis, and risk assessment supported by data analytics. These recent themes suggest a new paradigm in safety prediction. Aligned with this trajectory, the objectives of this study were to (1) identify a comprehensive list of potential predictors of SIFs in construction, including business factors, project characteristics, and crew demographics; (2) quantitatively prioritize potential predictors; and (3) develop a rank-ordered list of factors that could be tested for predictive validity and practically deployed on site. An expert panel of 22 industry practitioners generated 254 potential predictors of construction SIFs through structured brainstorming. To prioritize these potential predictors, the expert panel rated the extent to which each is measurable, predictive, simple, and actionable. Finally, a weighted sum method and a maximin approach was used to identify the predictors with the greatest practical potential for predicting SIF events, including brand-new concepts that have not yet been considered in the associated safety literature. Most previous research has focused on one specific form of safety prediction at a time (e.g., leading indicators), whereas this research effort is a first step toward a unified model with high feasibility and practical relevance. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction safety; Fatality prediction; Predictive factors; Safety management","Construction industry; Data Analytics; Forecasting; Risk assessment; Stress intensity factors; Leading indicators; Project characteristics; Rank-ordered Lists; Research efforts; Safety prediction; Serious injuries; Unified Modeling; Weighted sum method; Accident prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112464283

However, they can lead to bulky arrivals at subsequent stages, causing additional delays. Few studies have considered this effect so far. Preemption, on the other hand, can enforce the deadlines of important jobs in real situations. This study deals with a new production control problem of family based dispatching rules and preemption. No research has addressed both family based dispatching rules and preemption. A new framework of decision making is presented to solve this problem. The analysis of family based dispatching rules and preemption is carried out at a two-stage flow shop by simulation modeling and statistical analysis to discover several key factors. In addition, this research investigates the performance differences among different preemption types with respect to family based dispatching rules.

From 1971 to 2007, the annual mean temperature in the UBVZ increased by 0.15 °C/decade while summer rainfall decreased markedly. Logistic regression was used for modeling the perceptions and adaptation behavior of farmers. Farmers perceptions of climate change tended to closely match those estimated from the climate data, but farmers with better access to water resources, credit, and those with higher family income, higher production, and larger farm sizes had more options to adapt and were more likely to adopt techniques to cope with climate change and variability. Factors such as age, education level, and family size of respondents were less likely to impact farmers’ decisions to adapt to climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Assam; Climate trends; Logistic regression; Mann–Kendall test; Theil–Sen’s slope","climate change; decision making; education; estimation method; perception; questionnaire survey; rainfall; regression analysis; trend analysis; Brahmaputra Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102288831

These migrant farm workers and their families are deprived of access to the regular health care system and preventive services due to their remote locations. The government supports the delivery of different types of mobile health care services, such as vaccination for children, reproductive health and screening services. While planning the mobile health care service delivery, it is critical to know where the refugees will work during what time frame; hence the demand for the services. By analyzing the call record data of a major mobile network operator in Turkey, we quantify the increase in the volume of calls made by Syrian refugees in various agricultural areas during the harvesting season of local crops. This information helps us to forecast spatial and temporal distribution of demand for mobile health care services at a fine granularity. Taking demand over multiple periods as input into a mathematical programming model, we optimize the routing of mobile clinics that visit locations close to where refugees are concentrated over the given planning horizon. We consider three hierarchical objectives. Given the availability of a number of mobile clinics at community health centers in the districts, the first objective aims to maximize the percentage of refugees that can benefit from each service type within pre-defined close distances. The second objective minimizes the number of clinics needed while covering the maximum percentage of refugees. The third objective minimizes the total travel distance of the clinics, while keeping the maximum coverage level using a minimum number of clinics to achieve this level. We quantify the benefits of centralized planning (by the province directorate) over decentralized planning (by each district separately). We also show the trade-off between the required number of clinics and coverage of potential patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Call record data; Mathematical model; Mobile health care; Seasonal migrant workers; Vehicle routing","agricultural worker; health care; health services; migrant worker; numerical model; refugee; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099138893

Thus, when extraordinary events cause outlier demand, revenue management systems need to recognise this and adapt both forecast and controls. Many passenger transport service providers, such as railways and airlines, control the sale of tickets through revenue management. State-of-the-art systems in these industries rely on analyst expertise to identify outlier demand both online (within the booking horizon) and offline (in hindsight). So far, little research focuses on automating and evaluating the detection of outlier demand in this context. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach, which detects outliers using functional data analysis in combination with time series extrapolation. We evaluate the approach in a simulation framework, which generates outliers by varying the demand model. The results show that functional outlier detection yields better detection rates than alternative approaches for both online and offline analyses. Depending on the category of outliers, extrapolation further increases online detection performance. We also apply the procedure to a set of empirical data to demonstrate its practical implications. By evaluating the full feedback-driven system of forecast and optimisation, we generate insight on the asymmetric effects of positive and negative demand outliers. We show that identifying instances of outlier demand and adjusting the forecast in a timely fashion substantially increases revenue compared to what is earned when ignoring outliers. © 2021 The Authors","Forecasting; Functional data analysis; Outlier detection; Revenue management; Simulation","Data handling; Extrapolation; Forecasting; Online systems; Railroad transportation; Time series analysis; Asymmetric effects; Functional data analysis; On-line detection; Online and offline analysis; Passenger transport; Revenue management; Simulation framework; State-of-the-art system; Statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099629022

In our choice model, a customer incrementally views the assortment of available products in multiple stages. The patience level of a customer determines the maximum number of stages in which the customer is willing to view the assortments of products. In each stage, if the product with the largest utility provides larger utility than a minimum acceptable utility, which we refer to as the utility of the outside option, then the customer purchases that product right away. Otherwise, the customer views the assortment of products in the next stage as long as the customer’s patience level allows the customer to do so. Under the assumption that the utilities have the Gumbel distribution and are independent, we give a closed-form expression for the choice probabilities. For the assortment-optimization problem, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to find the revenue-maximizing sequence of assortments to offer. For the pricing problem, we show that, if the sequence of offered assortments is fixed, then we can solve a convex program to find the revenue-maximizing prices, with which the decision variables are the probabilities that a customer reaches different stages. We build on this result to give a 0.878-approximation algorithm when both the sequence of assortments and the prices are decision variables. We consider the assortment-optimization problem when each product occupies some space and there is a constraint on the total space consumption of the offered products. We give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for this constrained problem. We use a data set from Expedia to demonstrate that incorporating patience levels, as in our model, can improve purchase predictions. We also check the practical performance of our approximation schemes in terms of both the quality of solutions and the computation times. © 2021 INFORMS","Choice model; Impatient customer; Multinomial logit; Sequential recommendation","Convex optimization; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Polynomial approximation; Probability distributions; Assortment optimization; Choice model; Decision variables; Impatient customers; Multinomial Logit; Multinomial logit model; Optimization problems; Pricing problems; Revenue maximizing; Sequential recommendation; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117642268

To alleviate this problem, some providers have launched a low-priority service with preemptible (spot) instances, which allows them to attract more customers while keeping the right to reclaim capacities when necessary. In this study, we consider a provider who faces a heterogeneous pool of customers with fault-tolerant (interruptible) computing jobs. We develop an analytical framework that consists of a customer-choice model and a diffusion model to capture the underlying supply-demand dynamics and the resulting preemption probability. First, we examine a commonly used discount scheme for preemptible instances, namely, the uniform discount scheme, and derive the optimal discounted price, given customers' expectation of the preemption probability. Then,we propose another practical discount scheme, namely, the interruption-based discount scheme, which provides customers with compensation for interruptions. As long as the provider interrupts the preemptible instances randomly and customers are risk neutral, the two discount schemes are equivalent from the provider's perspective. That said, the proposed scheme is fairer than the uniform discount scheme from the customers' perspective, as the former provides more discounts to customers who experience more interruptions. Finally, in the presence of risk-averse customers, through a numerical study, we find that the provider would be better off by adopting the uniform discount scheme in an environment in which the level of surplus capacity stays high and stable. Overall, however, the provider would be better off by adopting the proposed scheme when the level of the surplus capacity is moderate and volatile; the relative advantage of the proposed scheme enlarges as the average surplus capacity decreases and its volatility increases.

We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program that models thousands or millions of items to be placed in dozens of fulfillment centers and shipped to dozens of customer regions. The objective is to minimize the sum of shipping and fixed costs over one planning period. Academic/practical relevance: A good placement plan can significantly reduce the operational cost, which is crucial for onlineretail businesses because they often have a low profit margin. The placement problem can be difficult to solve with existing techniques or off-the-shelf software because of the large number of items and the fulfillment center fixed costs and capacity constraints. Methodology: We propose a large-scale optimization framework that aggregates items into clusters, solves the cluster-level problem with column generation, and disaggregates the solution into item-level placement plans. We develop an a priori bound on the optimality gap, and we also apply the framework to a numerical example that consists of 1,000,000 items. Results: The a priori bound provides insights on how to select the appropriate aggregation criteria. For the numerical example, our framework produces a near-optimal solution in a few hours, significantly outperforming a sequential placement heuristic that approximates the status quo. Managerial implications: Our study provides a computationally efficient approach for solving online-retail inventory placement as well as similar large-scale optimization problems in practice. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Diverse teams have an inherent advantage in fostering desirable implicit/relational incentives that team members can provide to each other (tacit cooperation). In contrast, specialization both complicates the provision of cooperative incentives by altering the punishment agents can impose on each other for short expected career horizons and fosters undesirable implicit incentives (tacit collusion) for long expected horizons.

The defender seeks to hedge against the worst possible data realization, resulting in a robust optimization problem with a mixed-integer uncertainty set, which requires the solution of a challenging mixed-integer problem, which can be seen as a saddle-point problem over a nonconvex domain. Westudy two exact solution algorithms and present two feature applications for which the uncertainty is naturally modeled as a mixed-integer set. Our computational experiments show that the considered algorithms greatly outperform standard algorithms both in terms of computational time and solution quality. Moreover, our results show that modeling uncertainty with mixed-integer sets, instead of approximating the data using convex sets, results in less conservative solutions, which translates to a lower cost for the defender to protect from uncertainty. Summary of Contribution: We consider a class of defender-attacker problems where the defender has to make operational decisions that depend on uncertain actions from an adversarial attacker. Due to the type of information available to the defender, neither probabilistic modeling, nor robust optimization methods with convex uncertainty sets, are well suited to address the defender's decision-making problem. Consequently, we frame the defender's problem as a class of robust optimization problems with a mixed-integer uncertainty sets, and devise two exact algorithms that solve this class of problems. A comprehensive computational study shows that for the considered applications, our algorithms improves the performance of existing robust optimization approaches that can be adapted to solve this class of problems. Moreover, we show how mixed-integer uncertainty sets can reduce the level of over-conservatism that is a known issue of robust optimization approaches. © 2021 INFORMS.","bilevel optimization; cut generation; defender attacker; Frank-Wolfe algorithm; mixed-integer optimization; robust optimization","Decision making; Linear programming; Set theory; Uncertainty analysis; Bi-level optimization; Cut generation; Defender attacker; Frank-wolfe algorithms; Mixed integer; Mixed integer optimization; Mixed-integer sets; Optimization problems; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104145016

Using data from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey, we first investigate the role of employment in STEM occupations when it comes to recent changes in the occupational employment distribution in the U.S. labor market. Next, with data from the High School and Beyond sophomore cohort (Class of 1982) recent midlife follow-up, we investigate the importance of high school students’ mathematics and science coursework, knowledge, and skills for midlife occupations. The Class of 1982 completed high school prior to technological changes altering the demand for labor. We find that individuals who took more advanced levels of high school mathematics coursework enjoyed occupations with a higher percentile rank in the average wage distribution and were more likely to hold STEM-related occupations. Findings suggest that the mathematics coursework enabled workers to adapt and navigate changing labor market demands. © 2021","education; employment polarization; STEM occupations; wage inequality","Commerce; Employment; Engineering education; Students; Surveys; Follow up; High school; High school mathematics; High school students; Labor markets; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Technological change; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103731155

Indeed, it would be beneficial to have an overview of the social risks generated by novel products and understand what their potential supply chain would be like. To this end, this study presents a S-LCA study for identifying hotspots linked to a novel product: an antimicrobial keyboard cover integrating gold nanoparticles. Firstly, countries which could supply Europe with the input materials required in the system were identified, then by following the S-LCA methodology working hours and working functional hours were estimated. Ultimately, social risks were calculated by combining working functional hours with social risk levels and weights, concerning the relative importance of each category and sub-category. The analysis helped to determine which countries could supply the materials needed and hence become part of the potential supply chain of antimicrobial keyboard covers integrating gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, it led to the identification of main social hotspots linked to each material used. In general, results show that the stakeholders most at risk of adverse social impacts across different sectors and countries are workers. Indeed, they may be affected on both their rights and work conditions, health and safety.

One popular way to conduct microtransactions is via a loot box, which is a random allocation of virtual items whose contents are not revealed until after purchase. In this work, we consider how to optimally price and design loot boxes from the perspective of a revenue-maximizing video game company and analyze customer surplus under such selling strategies. Our paper provides the first formal treatment of loot boxes, with the aim to provide customers, companies, and regulatory bodies with insights into this popular selling strategy. We consider two types of loot boxes: A traditional one where customers can receive (unwanted) duplicates and a unique one where customers are guaranteed to never receive duplicates. We show that as the number of virtual items grows large, the unique box strategy is asymptotically optimal among all possible strategies, whereas the traditional box strategy only garners 36.7% of the optimal revenue. On the other hand, the unique box strategy leaves almost zero customer surplus, whereas the traditional box strategy leaves positive surplus. Further, when designing traditional and unique loot boxes, we show it is asymptotically optimal to allocate the items uniformly, even when the item valuation distributions are heterogeneous. We also show that, when the seller purposely misrepresents the allocation probabilities, their revenue may increase significantly, and thus, strict regulation is needed. Finally,we show that, even if the seller allows customers to salvage unwanted items, then the customer surplus can only increase by at most 1.4%. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

We characterize the optimal mechanism, which specifies a dynamic menu of prices and allocations. Service timing and pricing are used strategically to: (i) dynamically manage demand-capacity imbalances, and (ii) provide discriminated service levels. The balance between these two objectives depends on customer heterogeneity and customers' time sensitivities. The optimal policy may feature strategic idlenexss (deliberately rejecting incoming requests for discrimination), late service prioritization (clearing the queue of delayed customers), and deliberate late-service rejection (focusing on incoming demand by rationing capacity for delayed customers). Surprisingly, the price charged to time-sensitive customers is not increasing with demand-high demand may trigger lower prices. By dynamically adjusting a menu of prices and service levels, the optimal mechanism increases profits significantly, as compared with dynamic pricing and static screening benchmarks. We also suggest a less information-intensive mechanism that is history-independent but fine-tunes the menu with incoming demand; this easier-to-implement mechanism yields close-tooptimal outcomes. © 2021 INFORMS.","Dynamic mechanism design; Dynamic pricing; Online platforms; Strategic timing","Economics; Resource allocation; Sales; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Dynamic pricing; Implement mechanisms; Optimal mechanism; Optimal policies; Resource allocation policy; Service levels; Stochastic demand; Time sensitivity; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112130579

I estimate the effect of seeding using a natural experiment in which an oversight caused about 60% of U.S. counties to be seeded with a complete census map, while the rest were seeded with less complete versions. Although access to basic knowledge generally encourages downstream knowledge production, I find that a higher level of information seeding significantly lowered follow-on contributions and contributor activity on Open- StreetMap, and was associated with lower levels of long-term quality. However, seeding did benefit densely populated urban areas and did not discourage more committed users. To explain these patterns, I argue that information seeding can crowd out contributors' ability to develop ownership over baseline knowledge and thereby disincentivize followon contributions. © 2021 INFORMS.","Crowdsourcing; Digitization; Innovation; Knowledge production; Online communities","Online systems; Surveys; Knowledge production; Natural experiment; On-line communities; Urban areas; Wikipedia; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112127795

Considering the MAFE and mean squared forecast error (MSFE) criteria together, we see that the quantile regression is more accurate relative to OLS when the profitability to be forecast has a heavier-tailed distribution.

Healthcare providers often consider plans such as increasing in-house repairs, using multiple repair service providers, or timely replacement of devices to overcome this issue. This study aims to develop a data-driven Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework based on Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model to optimize medical equipment repair and replacement decisions. Effective decision-making on whether to repair or replace is crucial to managing the product lifecycle cost and the costs to healthcare facilities. The study determines the optimal repair or replacement decision based on the product lifecycle data and current product failure status. It utilizes a net present value model to maximize expected value over an infinite time horizon. The study uses a dataset of 24,516 repair and maintenance records of 5,171 individual medical devices of a particular type to extract parameters needed for the optimization model. The dataset provides a rich baseline for analyzing different failures and event modes during product lifespan such as battery-related issues, random failure, preventive maintenance, and physical damage. It further quantifies the chance of moving from one product status to another. The model outcomes are discussed for a particular case. The findings reveal the most frequent reasons for failures and the most economically viable repair and replacement decision for each end-of-use device based on their current condition. Several sensitivity analyses are conducted to clarify the impact of operating revenue and warranty time on the repair or replacement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Markov decision process; Medical device; Optimization; Repair; Replacement","Costs; Decision making; Health care; Markov processes; Optimization; Preventive maintenance; Sensitivity analysis; 'current; Cost of maintenance; Cost of repairs; Health care providers; Healthcare industry; Markov Decision Processes; Medical Devices; Optimisations; Repair and maintenance; Replacement; Repair; equipment; health care; Markov chain; medicine; optimization; controlled study; cost; discrete time Markov chain; frequency analysis; income; life cycle; lifespan; Markov decision process; optimization framework; probability; process optimization; recycling; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106627100

It has been argued that natural resources are either a blessing or a curse for any resource rich country. Given the critical role these natural resources play in the economy, the present study estimates the long run and short run impacts of natural resource rents on GDP per capita and Total Factor Productivity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, the cointegration and error correction approach based on the autoregressive distributed lags model is used. The results indicate that natural resource rents increase per capita GDP and Total Factor Productivity significantly in the long run, highlighting that natural resources are considered as a blessing for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the long run. Moreover, enhancement in human capital increases per capita GDP and total factor productivity significantly in the long run. Based on these results, the study suggests that investing in human capital is an urgent move to reach sustainability in the long run, and to decrease reliance on natural resource rents to circumvent the occurrences of the resource curse in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ARDL; Human capital; Institutional quality; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Per capita GDP; Resource curse; Resource rents; TFP","Economics; Error correction; Personnel; Productivity; ARDL; Human capitals; Institutional qualities; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Longest run; Per capita; Per caput GDP; Resource curse; Resource rents; TFP; Natural resources; cointegration analysis; economic impact; error correction; Gross Domestic Product; human capital; natural resource; sustainability; total factor productivity; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104921015

Despite the rapid progress, little is still known what makes a project instance hard to solve. Inspired by a previous research study that has shown that even small instances with only up to 30 activities is sometimes hard to solve, the current study provides an analysis of the project data used in the academic literature. More precisely, it investigates the ability of four well-known resource indicators to predict the hardness of an RCPSP instance. The study introduces a new instance equivalence concept to show that instances might have very different values for their resource indicators without changing any possible solution for this instance. The concept is based on four theorems and a search algorithm that transforms existing instances into new equivalent instances with more compact resources. This algorithm illustrates that the use of resource indicators to predict the hardness of an instance is sometimes misleading. In a set of computational experiment on more than 10,000 instances, it is shown that the newly constructed equivalent instances have values for the resource indicators that are not only different than the values of the original instances, but also often are better in predicting the hardness the project instances. It is suggested that the new equivalent instances are used for further research to compare results on the new instances with results obtained from the original dataset. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hardness; Project networks; Resource constraints; Resource-constrained project scheduling","Computational complexity; Forecasting; Hardness; Academic literature; Computational experiment; Optimal solutions; Project data; Research studies; Resource-constrained project scheduling problem; Search Algorithms; Solution procedure; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104151274

Because of this characteristic, we study possible integration of blockchain technology with a local neighborhood power grid, to design a truly decentralized energy trading market. The proposed design allows energy producers within the local power networks to safely transact with neighborhood households. In other words, the users who have a redundant amount of power can sell it to users who need power at a fairer price, than is offered by a utility company. We show that such local trades provide benefits to both electricity buyers and sellers. This paper does two things: (1) establishes a mathematical game theory model for the users’ decision to buy or sell power in the peer-to-peer energy market and (2) discuss blockchain software stack for deploying such a system. For the first part, we use a smart algorithm built upon KKT conditions to solve the multi-level game theory model. Secondly, we show how the electricity price offered by the central company is influenced by the introduction of the blockchain to the power transaction system. As supporting evidence we provide experimental data—the simulation of the market and its infrastructure using blockchain Hyperledger’s Fabric framework. Finally, we found that the electricity price can decrease dramatically by allowing peer-to-peer transactions among prosumers and consumers unless the amount of generating power from prosumers is much lower than their demand. We foresee a great future for the applications of blockchain technology in this area with the increasing mass adoption of solar and renewable generation at the consumer level. However, these processes will enact more discussions on power delivery grid ownership and its public access, usage, and management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Energy trading; Game theory; Hyperledger; Power transaction; Prosumer","Blockchain; Decision theory; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Game theory; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Sales; Buyers and sellers; Decentralized energy; Electricity prices; Game theory models; Local neighborhoods; Mathematical games; Power transactions; Renewable generation; Fintech",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101545406

We take into account three objectives: The sending university aims to maximize the number of nominations, the students seek nomination for a highly preferred university and, finally, the receiving universities strive for excellent incoming students. Pairwise comparison of students should guarantee the following fairness: A student with higher academic achievements should be preferred over a student with lower academic achievements. We provide mathematical programming models of the nomination problem which maximize the overall objectives and guarantee different types of pairwise fairness. Several years of real data from a major school are employed to evaluate the models’ performance including a benchmark against the heuristic that is used by the school. We show analytically and experimentally that the heuristic approach fails to guarantee some pairwise fairness. Our results reveal the following four insights: First, compared to the current approach, up to 6.6% more students can be nominated with our optimization model while ensuring all pairwise fairness perspectives. Second, on average, students are nominated with better academic achievements. Third, the problem instances can be solved to optimality within a fraction of a second even for large-size instances comprising more than 500 students and about 150 schools offering nearly 450 exchange places. This is important for its use in practice. Last, up to 17.9% more students can be nominated when considering the overall objective to maximize nominations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Education; Greedy algorithm; Multiple knapsack problem; Student placement","algorithm; computer simulation; educational attainment; numerical model; stakeholder; student; university sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097054874

This transfer, occurring within and across industries, results in technology spillovers that may affect both intra- and interindustry productivity. Intellectual property rights (IPR) legislation may increase (or reduce) this effect. Using Chilean plant-level data for the 2001–2007 period and an exogenous variation from an IPR reform in 2005, we explore whether or not IPR affects the spillover effects of licensing on productivity. We find that stronger IPR reduces backward spillovers but increases forward spillovers. Moreover, the IPR legislation effect is stronger on firms that are on average smaller, and have low productivity. Our results are robust not only to a series of definitions of IPR, licensing, and productivity, but also to a set of different specifications. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","C5; Chile; K2; O34; O44; Productivity; Spillovers; Technology licensing","industrial performance; industrial policy; industrial production; intellectual property rights; multinational enterprise; spillover effect; technology policy; technology transfer; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086779400

As opposed to this, we focus on estimating a nonparametric choice model from observational data in a dynamic setting, where observations are obtained over time. We show that choice model estimation can be cast as a convex-concave saddle point joint estimation and optimization problem, and we provide an online convex optimization-based primal-dual framework for deriving algorithms to solve this problem. By tailoring our framework carefully to the choice model estimation problem, we obtain tractable algorithms with provable convergence guarantees and explicit bounds on the sparsity of the estimated model.

The model allows both types of uncertainty (real economic activity and oil price) to directly affect oil prices and economic activity. More importantly, the factor variable, which is akin to the macroeconomic uncertainty measure of Henzel and Rengel (2017), captures the significant indirect spillover effects of both supply-related (oil prices) and demand-related (business cycle) shocks on oil prices and economic activity. By incorporating the indirect effect of this macroeconomic uncertainty, the response of economic activity to oil price shocks is amplified. In some countries the real effect is prolonged. Results for net oil exporting (importing) countries show that an oil price hike has an appreciably positive (negative) effect on economic activity.

In this paper we identify the short-run impacts of storms and floods on firm growth in labor, capital, and sales, using Enterprise Census data (2000–2014) for Vietnam. We define storms and floods with three different disaster measures: physical intensities, number of deaths, and economic damage. The performance of these disaster measures is compared by estimating dynamic growth models using the Blundell–Bond system generalized method of moments. We find evidence that flooding increases labor growth and capital growth but reduces sales growth significantly up to 3 years after flooding. We also find some evidence of positive impacts on labor growth and capital growth but mostly negative impacts on sales growth for storms within 3 years after storms strike. The impacts of floods and storms on firm growth are more pronounced and persistent for small and medium sized firms. Finally, unlike at the macro level, the direction and scale of disaster impacts found at the firm level are fairly consistent across the three disaster measures. © 2021, The Author(s).","Disaster impact; Firm growth; GMM; Natural disaster; Physical intensity","Climate change; Floods; Method of moments; Population statistics; Sales; Storms; Capital growth; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reductions; Dynamic growth model; Economic damages; Generalized method of moments; Natural disasters; Small and medium sized firms; Disasters; adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; economic conditions; economic growth; firm size; flooding; natural disaster; small and medium-sized enterprise; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105407041

These are strategic decisions about production interdependence: the degree to which materials and services are provided internally versus purchased externally. Information technology (IT) has increased productivity with hardware and software such as robotics and flexible manufacturing systems. IT has also improved information sharing and coordination along the supply chain by integrating business processes with software. Within manufacturing, we examine whether hardware and software are related to choices of make versus buy differently. From a transaction cost perspective this can be due to differential impacts on reducing internal production costs versus external coordination costs. We find that in U.S. manufacturing industries from 1998 to 2016, hardware favors internal production suggesting hardware reduces costs of internal provision more; software increased purchases from upstream suppliers suggesting software reduces costs of external provision more. This result shows that hardware and software complementarity has limits in that each has distinct productivity targets, and that empirically the decision of make versus buy is manifested by investments in these different types of IT capital. That is, when facing strategic decisions about make versus buy in manufacturing, hardware and software have opposite impacts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Direct backward linkage (DBL); Information technology; Make versus buy; Production interdependence; Productivity; Supply chains; Transaction costs","Flexible manufacturing systems; Productivity; Strategic materials; Supply chains; Hardware and software; Increased productivity; Information sharing; Integrating business process; Make-or-buy decisions; Manufacturing industries; Strategic decisions; Supply chain relationships; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103714641

S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), nutrient pollution was viewed as America’s most “widespread, costly and challenging environmental problem” (USEPA 2020a, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-03/documents/facts_about_nutrient_pollution_what_is_hypoxia.pdf). The economic damages accruing to nutrient pollution are extensive and substantial. Not only do such “spillovers” affect tourism but also recreational and commercial fishing. Property values are impacted as drinking water is often tapped from aquifers, etc., when groundwater is either not available or its quality has been compromised by the sort of nutrient spillovers we analyze in our paper. The EPA estimates that home prices are up to 25% higher when clean water is available and waterfront property values can decline because of the many problems associated with algal blooms. The costs of treating water that has been polluted from nutrients are substantial. An example is the case of Minnesota where nitrate and algal blooms required nitrate-removal systems that increased the drinking water costs from 5 to 10 cents per 1000 gallons to over $4 per 1000 gallons (USEPA 2020b, https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-economy). Although the notion that “spillovers” from nutrient pollution exist is intuitive, such externalities have not been evaluated empirically using recent advances in spatial panel econometrics, especially in the context of how such externalities spillover into the supply of drinking water supplied by local water utilities. Such an analysis requires a substantial understanding of how water management decisions are made, the technologies in play, and how various environmental policies, regulations, and directives interact with the generation of clean drinking water when contagion caused by nutrient runoff and poor or illegal pollution abatement strategies by firms pollute our country’s drinking water. Although our study does not formally imbed such factors into a structural model, they do inform our modeling approach and motivate our discussion of sometimes arcane issues surrounding environmental policy, the science of nutrient generation, and how nutrient pollution impacts water quality spatially. Our study explores the spatial effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollution and drinking water production patterns in agriculture. Two important examples are that water utilities that deliver and treat drinking water in agricultural areas have to deal with excess nitrogen and phosphorus released to the environment by crop and livestock operations, an externality created by the agricultural sector; also, the drinking water production sector in rural areas is highly fragmented, with a multitude of enterprise sizes, organizational forms and network densities that have spatial components. We analyze nutrient pollution based on data collected via the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 to estimate how water bodies and sub-basins impaired by nutrient pollution to spatially affect drinking water utilities based on input distance functions that address varying productive efficiencies of water utilities as well as their scale and scope of operations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Clean water production; Efficiency; Nutrient pollution; Productivity; Scale and scope economies; Spatial effects; Water utilities","algal bloom; drinking water; efficiency measurement; nitrate; nitrogen; nutrient; phosphorus; pollution control; water management; water pollution; water quality; water supply; water treatment; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102437618

We look at the betting odds, the official tennis rankings, the standard Elo ratings, surface-specific Elo ratings, and weighted composites of these ratings, including and excluding the betting odds. The performance indicators used are prediction accuracy, calibration, model discrimination, Brier score, and expected return. We find that the betting odds perform relatively well across these tournaments, while standard Elo (especially for women's tennis) and surface-adjusted Elo (especially for men's tennis) also perform well on a range of indicators. For all but the hard-court surfaces, a forecasting model which incorporates the betting odds tends also to perform well on some indicators. We find that the official ranking system proved to be a relatively poor measure of likely performance compared to betting odds and Elo-related methods.

By encouraging individualised acts of compassion for dying patients and their families, the 3 Wishes Project (3WP) has been shown to ease grief for both families and clinicians. Purpose The objective of this study was to explore the perspectives of hospital leaders on the value of the 3WP to the hospital and how decisions are made about which programmes to support. Methods We conducted semistructured interviews with 20 hospital leaders in four North American institutions. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results Interviews with 12 clinical managers and 8 senior administrators identified the institutional value of the 3WP as improving patient and family experiences, enhancing staff morale, translating institutional mission and values into front-line practice, and creating positive public relations. Hospital leaders acknowledged potential resource challenges, including staff time, space to store supplies and funds to purchase items for some wishes. However, citing stories they had heard from families and staff, hospital leaders shared their view of how their decisions about the value of clinical programmes extend beyond quantifiable outcomes. Conclusions When reflecting on this personalised palliative care programme, hospital leaders described how inspiring narratives promoted institutional values in ways that are difficult to measure quantitatively. Leaders underscored the need to balance the value that a programme brings with the resources it requires, stating how different types of evidence influence their support of new programmes.

Our results demonstrate that firms backed by VCs enjoy a far greater spike in attention than their counterparts. Furthermore, we find that firms with more prominent VCs, a larger number of VCs, and VCs situated at farther geographic distances exhibit significantly greater spikes in investors’ attention during the week of their IPO. Combined, the findings show a clear demarcation between entrepreneurial firms with or without VC backing, they bring to the fore new upshots stemming from the relationship between VCs and entrepreneurial firms, and they raise new potential questions on this relationship and beyond. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Entrepreneurship; Google; Information economics; IPO; Search; Signaling; Trends; VC","Investments; Entrepreneurial firms; Initial public offerings; Searching for informations; Time-periods; Venture Capital; Venture capitalists; Binary alloys; capitalism; entrepreneur; industrial investment; information and communication technology; multinational enterprise; Elliptio dilatata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084383673

Academic/practical relevance: As opposed to traditional manufacturer/retailer settings, intermediaries in display advertising auction off contingent goods that they purchase only if downstream buyers signal interest. This motivates our study of how intermediaries should bid on behalf of their customers in the mechanism of an upstream intermediary and how the structure of the intermediation network affects the profits of its participants. Methodology: We provide a game-Theoretic model to study the mechanisms offered by the ad exchange and intermediaries within a practically relevant class of mechanisms. Results: We characterize a subgame perfect equilibrium of the game among the intermediaries and the seller, and show that the equilibrium mechanisms have a simple and appealing structure: intermediaries bid the virtual value associated with the maximum downstream report in the upstream intermediary's mechanism, whenever this quantity is positive. Managerial implications: We show that economic incentives are not necessarily aligned along the network and that the position in the intermediation network has a significant impact on the profits of the intermediaries. That is, when advertisers' value distribution has a ""light tail,"" upstream intermediaries profit more (relative to downstream ones). Moreover, as the tail of the advertisers' value distribution gets heavier, downstream intermediaries profit more, and their profits eventually exceed those of upstream ones. In addition, we show that a horizontal merger may not be profitable for intermediaries, and we analyze the impact of market size on the profits of intermediaries. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

We infer lessons from the experience of individual contributors to Wikipedia articles about U.S. politics. We identify two factors that cause a tendency toward moderation in collective opinion: Either biased contributors contribute less, which shifts the composition of participants, or biased contributors moderate their own views. Our findings show that shifts in the composition of participants account for 80%-90% of the moderation in content. Contributors tend to contribute to articles with slants that are opposite their own views. Evidence suggests that encountering extreme contributors with an opposite slant plays an important role in triggering the composition shift and changing views. These findings suggest that collective intelligence becomes more trustworthy when mechanisms encourage confrontation between distinct viewpoints. They also suggest, cautiously, that managers who aspire to produce content ""from all sides""should let the most biased contributors leave the collective conversation if they can be replaced with more moderate voices. © 2020 INFORMS.","Contested knowledge; Online community; User segregation; Wikipedia","Operations research; Collective intelligences; Composition shifts; On-line communities; Wikipedia articles; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106550076

In 2001, the government established an arbitrary rule that granted municipalities with a 2002 population >100,000 almost complete autonomy to provide education services (certification). This analysis takes advantage of this rule to evaluate, using difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity methodologies, the effect of municipal autonomy on teacher quality and student outcomes, including achievement and enrollment. The control group is made up of municipalities for which the provision of education was centralized and managed by the departmental authorities. The results indicate that administrative decentralization (being certified) improves both school enrollment and student achievement as well as the quality of teachers, as measured by teachers’ education level and scores on teachers’ entry competency exams. Using a mediation analysis, the paper finds that higher-quality teachers hired by the certified municipalities partially explained the improvement in student achievement. This analysis also shows that “certified” municipalities invest more local resources in education which also contributes to explain to a much lesser extent their superior educational outcomes. Finally, the results suggest that achieving better student outcomes is less related to the amount of resources that decentralized municipalities managed and more associated with the fact that those resources seem to have been better allocated, generating significant efficiency gains. These gains may be the consequence of lower transaction costs of matching local preferences with local educational interventions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Colombia; Difference-in-difference models; Education decentralization; Educational achievement; Regression discontinuity models; Teacher quality","academic performance; decentralization; decision making; education policy; educational development; governance approach; student; teaching; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100249510

In 2017, 55% of premium production was generated over insurance agencies in Turkey making independent agency evaluation prominent in the domain. Unfortunately lacking attention from the scientific community, agency evaluation problem is usually tackled in the industry by utilizing internal business dynamics data. To incorporate the external facts to the agency evaluation process, we propose a computational approach to model behavior traits reflecting insurance agency channel dynamics based on not only premium sales big data but also external facts. We demonstrate how we translate these behavior traits into useful features, namely, utilization, response, and governance, so that each agency can be positioned in a space whose dimensions are determined by these features allowing easy visual detection of segments. Utilization model suggests that each agency has a potential based on its location, determined by several local socioeconomic factors, and it explains the capability of converting potential to profit. To compute utilization scores, we adapt point-of-interest data as a parameter to the segmentation model, a novel approach not only in the insurance business but also in the literature. The response model suggests that a responsive agency must follow overall profit trends of the company. Finally, the governance model explains agency/company cooperation in terms of premium production. All together, we propose a segmentation-based agency evaluation model providing understanding of insurance agency behavior that could be explained and formulated along these three dimensions. Based on the findings from a year-long case study and a proceeding implementation period of our models on an actual analytic system of the insurance company donating the data, we reflect on the performance and usability of our behavioral models that were fit on premium sales big data comprising 127 million transactions. Our results suggest that (1) our approach is quite efficient in extracting features from production logs, (2) behavioral models are quite intuitive resulting in straightforward application steps, and (3) the adoption of behavior models in agency segmentation and evaluation processes is an improvement over commonplace approaches in which premium production is used as the sole metric. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","agency evaluation; behavior models; decision tree regression; independent insurance agencies; premium sales; segmentation","Behavioral research; Big data; Dynamics; Profitability; Sales; Computational approach; Evaluation modeling; Evaluation problems; Extracting features; Insurance companies; Scientific community; Segmentation models; Socio-economic factor; Insurance; insurance; Big Data; Insurance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104656929

In 2013, policy-makers suddenly expanded the scope of the original tax break to cover more bachelor's degrees and sector codes in IT. We first use firm-level data and difference-in-difference designs around each policy episode to show that treated firms experience strong and long-lasting growth. We then employ sector-level data and a synthetic control design to show that after the introduction of this policy in 2001, the IT sector grew faster in Romania than in otherwise similar countries. Finally, downstream sectors relying more on IT services also grew faster in Romania after 2001.

More specifically, we fit the MMFE to the data for a variety of seeds (SKUs) produced by a major seed manufacturer and rank these SKUs based on their demand volume and volatility. We then assess the value of the MMFE-based accurate response by benchmarking it against the classic newsvendor model.

Instead of implementing separate IT services, governments come together to pool their IT resources into one single IT service. In this study, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze the governments' decision to share IT services and understand how the introduction of shared services transforms the strategic interactions between the governments and the vendor. We study three common regimes used in the adoption of shared IT services: (1) a cost-sharing regime where costs are split proportionally, (2) a profit-center regime where one government charges a surplusmaximization price to the other, and (3) a coordination regime where governments coordinate their decisions to maximize aggregate surplus. Our analyses generate several intriguing findings. First, although charging a surplus-maximizing price seems to be a lucrative option, we find that a government does not always benefit by acting as a profit center. Second, the cost-sharing regime does not always incentivize the shared service adoption despite being often viewed as a fairer and more convenient arrangement. Third, we find that there can be significant under-utilization of shared services in the absence of proper coordination, in a sense that the governments may choose not to share their IT services even if doing so would increase their aggregate surplus. Finally, even though coordination promotes the adoption of shared IT services, it can sometimes be inefficient from the social welfare's perspective because the increase in governments' surplus can be outweighed by the decrease in the vendor's profit. We also present a range of extensions to our model to show that our main takeaways carry over when some model assumptions are relaxed. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

With higher population growth, fertility and workforce participation rates, the US multicultural population is projected to account for a much larger proportion of the US workforce in the decades to come. The degree to which corporate America is able to maximise productivity and manage cultural diversity effectively will not only impact workforce participation, but also economic output. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for cultural diversity to help corporations manage their increasingly diverse workforce and help transform their companies into multicultural organisations to better serve their diverse employees — and their consumers. The paper outlines a robust toolkit, arguing that companies must take a comprehensive approach to address the lack of diversity in corporate America rather than launch ‘diversity and inclusion’ initiatives, as many have recently done.

We use variance decomposition analysis to quantify the relative importance of customer, employee, process, location, and market-level effects on customer satisfaction. In our models, which explain roughly a quarter of the aggregate variance, differences among customers account for 96%–97% of the explainable portion. Further analysis of interaction-level data from banking and quick-service restaurants reveals that customers report relatively consistent satisfaction across transactions with particular firms but that some customers are habitually more satisfied than others. A second set of empirical studies provides evidence that these customer-level differences are explained in part by customer compatibility. Customers whose needs, proxied by differences in demographics and product choices, diverge more starkly from those of their bank’s average customers report significantly lower levels of satisfaction. Consistently, banks that serve customer bases with more dispersed needs receive lower satisfaction scores than banks serving customer bases with less dispersed needs. Finally, a longitudinal analysis of the deposit and loan growth of all federally insured banks in the United States from 2006 to 2017 reveals that customer compatibility affects a firm’s financial performance. Branches with more divergent customers grow more slowly than branches with less divergent customers. Institutions serving customer bases with more dispersed needs have branches that exhibit slower growth than those of institutions serving customer bases with less dispersed needs.

We examine the effectiveness of the program in conserving forests through participation rate, average size and site productivity of enrolled forestland, and trends in forest area. An econometric model is created to investigate the major factors affecting participation of the program. We found that the FLPA program is effective in attracting larger forest tracts, suggesting a positive contribution of the program to forest conservation and sustainability.

A decision variable defining an “acceptable level of risk” allows decision makers to specify tolerable levels of in situ breed endangerment when taking ex situ collection and storage decisions.

Component data consist of time-varying indices for each of a number of different species. However, current biodiversity indicators suffer from multiple statistical shortcomings. We describe a state-space formulation for new multispecies biodiversity indicators, based on rates of change in the abundance or occupancy probability of the contributing individual species. The formulation is flexible and applicable to different taxa. It possesses several advantages, including the ability to accommodate the sporadic unavailability of data, incorporate variation in the estimation precision of the individual species’ indices when appropriate, and allow the direct incorporation of smoothing over time. Furthermore, model fitting is straightforward in Bayesian and classical implementations, the latter adopting either efficient Hidden Markov modelling or the Kalman filter. Conveniently, the same algorithms can be adopted for cases based on abundance or occupancy data—only the subsequent interpretation differs. The procedure removes the need for bootstrapping which can be prohibitive. We recommend which of two alternatives to use when taxa are fully or partially sampled. The performance of the new approach is demonstrated on simulated data, and through application to three diverse national UK data sets on butterflies, bats and dragonflies. We see that uncritical incorporation of index standard errors should be avoided.

We focus on estimating exposure (which locations are likely to be seen) and the intensity of exposure (how long are they seen) by accounting for the dynamic interaction between the human 3D field of regard with a physical rack layout. Our quantitative approach allows us to analyze the effect of varying layout design parameters (i.e., rack orientation, curvature, and height) on exposure considering both unidirectional and bidirectional travel. We also validate our approach through human participants in a virtual layout. We observed that curving racks in a layout with racks oriented 90° (i.e., perpendicular to the aisle) increase exposure by 3–121% over straight racks. Further, orientating curved racks at acute angles leads to substantially higher exposure (18–321%) over straight racks at 90°. Moreover, racks with a height just below shopper eye-height results in higher exposure over racks just above eye-height when top surfaces are accounted for as exposed. Considering the trade-off between exposure and layout floor space, when given an allowable 25% increase in floor space, we found feasible layouts that increased exposure ranging from 15–530% (over straight racks at 90°) depending on shopper scanning pattern, layout size, and traffic direction. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Exposure; Field of vision; Quantitative model; Retail layout","Economic and social effects; Floors; Dynamic interaction; Exposure; Field of regard; Quantitative approach; Quantitative modeling; Retail layout; Shopping paths; Traffic directions; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074458392

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the technology acceptance theory and trust formation theory, the research posits and develops a comprehensive trust model by integrating trust-related factors that correlate to the consumer’s trusting beliefs and trusting intention. Survey data with 525 respondents allow to test and validate the model. Findings: The tested model shows that technology institutional trust base, end-user’s cognitive trust base and social influence are significant determinants of trusting beliefs. The findings also reveal that mediation effects of performance expectancy and perceived risks exist in the relationship between trusting beliefs and trusting intention. Originality/value: The foreseeable positive impact and rapid market growth of emerging healthcare technologies necessitate the strong need to study user acceptance. However, there is a lack of research on how consumers trust and their adoption intention of such innovations. Prior empirical evidence from different contexts and perspectives also show contradictory findings. This research extends the existing technology acceptance literature to a healthcare context, provides an improved generalized understanding of the consumer’s trusting mechanism in emerging biotechnology and discusses practical insights for regulatory authorities, healthcare institutes and medical professionals. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer adoption intention; Emerging biotechnology; Healthcare management; Structural equation modeling; Trusting mechanism","Health care; Surveys; Adoption intention; Comprehensive trust models; Design/methodology/approach; Healthcare technology; Institutional trust; Medical professionals; Regulatory authorities; Technology acceptance; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097596975

We find a 26% rental rate premium for organic farmland not driven by higher profits on organic farms. This premium is a modest incentive for landowners but a barrier for tenants to convert to organic farming practices, which may explain limited growth in U.S. organic acreage.

The model assumes wealthy people are more able to afford the costs of entrepreneurship. Wealth concentration therefore stimulates entrepreneurship among the rich and so aggregate growth, whose fruits in turn are largely captured by the rich. This process creates a mechanism by which inequality and growth are correlated. The model is estimated and tested by Indirect Inference and is not rejected.

We show that most of the variation in TFP growth is explained by variation in technical efficiency change. Moreover, we examine the effects of important macro- and micro-level factors on inefficiency as well as its asset pricing implications.

Using a sample of 7,185 firm-year observations and a panel fixed-effects model, we find that CIO structural power is positively associated with forward-looking firm performance (proxied by Tobin’s q). Further, our results suggest that the benefits of CIO structural power are higher under greater market turbulence, higher industry IT intensity, and greater operating efficiency.

Another is the way US development has been shaped and to some extent offset by international resource transfers. To explain these phenomena, attention is paid to the role of profitability as a driver of productivity and investment and global hegemony as a driver of international resource transfers. Particular attention is paid to an empirical analysis of the profitability of the US corporate non-financial sector and the existence of a secular decline in profitability since the mid-1960s interrupted only by the upward phases of a series of shorter-term economic cycles. Attention is also paid to the role of financial investments and some of the international resource transfers that have shaped, offset, and contained relative economic decline.

However, the existing analysis of resource sharing and profit allocation is still limited. Therefore, this study aims to model resource sharing in two-echelon delivery and pickup logistics networks to improve the overall efficiency and decrease the total network operating cost. A bi-objective integer programming model is first proposed for two-echelon collaborative multidepot pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2E-CMDPDTW) to seek the minimization of operating costs and number of vehicles. Integrating a customer clustering algorithm, a greedy algorithm, and an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (Im-NSGA-II), a hybrid method is then designed to handle the 2E-CMDPDTW model. The customer clustering and the greedy algorithms are employed to generate locally optimized initial solutions to accelerate the calculating velocity and guarantee the diversity of feasible solutions. The Im-NSGA-II combines the order crossover operation and the polynomial mutation process to find the optimal solution of the 2E-CMDPDTW. The comparative results show that the proposed hybrid method outperforms the NSGA-II and the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Furthermore, a Shapley value method is used for allocating total profits of established alliances and finding an optimal coalition sequence of the logistics facilities joining alliances based on the strictly monotonic path strategy. Finally, a case study of 2E-CMDPDTW in Chongqing China is conducted to validate the feasibility. Results indicate that this study contributes to long-term partnerships between logistics facilities within multi-echelon logistics networks in practice and contributes to the long-term sustainability of urban logistics pickup and delivery networks' development. © 2021 Siyu Luo et al.",,"Clustering algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Pickups; Polynomials; Profitability; Greedy algorithms; Hybrid method; Logistics facility; Logistics network; Multi depots; Network design; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Profit allocation; Resources sharing; Operating costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118115137

It is theoretically proposed and empirically illustrated that differences in human behavior are significant deep-rooted causes of spatial economic and productivity disparities. The article examines the relationship between behavioral constructs and productivity using data for local areas across England. Measures of personality psychology and community culture (including both living culture and cultural heritage) are hypothesized to be related to activities impacting upon productivity performance at the local level. The analysis indicates that underlying human behavioral factors play a role in determining rates of productivity and levels of economic development in localities and regions. Culture and psychological traits, as manifested in the form of the psychocultural behavior of localities and regions, appear to shape their long-term development trajectories. Localities that have relatively atomized behavioral environments with high levels of individual commitment tend to enjoy productivity benefits. Similarly, places with high rates of cultural diversity and extravert individuals have relatively high rates of productivity. It is concluded that from a policy perspective, governments looking to level up local and regional economies should pay greater attention to understanding behavioral influences on productivity, especially related to strategies focused on behavioral nudges, institutional changes, and education systems. © 2021 Clark University.","behavior; culture; economic development; localities; personality psychology; productivity; regions","cultural influence; economic development; institutional framework; mental health; psychology; public health; type locality; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116944653

The Covid-19 pandemic adds impetus to considering training trends given the importance of skills for economic recovery. Many workers are adapting to work and learning increasingly moving online. The Covid-19 crisis accentuates the need for employees to upskill and reskill and participate in new ways of learning. But how well equipped are surveys to capture these new trends? This paper reviews the focus of employer and employee training surveys in the UK alongside findings from selected in-depth employer interviews on training trends. It identifies greater focus on formal than informal training in current surveys, and a narrow interpretation of informal training. It identifies a gap in understanding the different types, duration and value of some informal workplace learning, while recent workplace changes mean the distinction between on- and off-the-job training is becoming less useful than previously. To capture new approaches to learning, surveys need to focus more on who is responsible for workplace training, communities of practice and perceived benefits of training. © 2021 The Author(s).

Whereas previous studies assessed the economic worth of channel promotions independently of each other, our study delved into the effects of integrated omnichannel campaigns. Using a randomized field experiment design, we provide empirical evidence of an offline direct experience effect and revealed short-term channel substitution (spillover) effects among customers who only use the online-channel (offline-channel). We further examined omnichannel conversion behaviors after exposure to online promotion and developed different coupon schemes based on responses to the previously offered offline initiative. Finally, we detected significant patterns of post-treatment omnichannel migration and confirmed the effectiveness of integrated omnichannel promotions in fostering a shift to omnichannel shopping. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","channel integration; mobile promotion; mobile targeting; offline-to-online; Omnichannel marketing; omnichannel migration; online-to-offline; randomized field experiment","Knowledge management; Channel promotions; Direct experience; Field experiment; Offline channel; Online channels; Retail industry; Significant patterns; Strategic marketing; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112597342

An online questionnaire was built to collect: demographic data, participant’s general privacy profile using the Privacy Segmentation Index (PSI) which classifies individuals into 3 groups (privacy fundamentalists, pragmatists, and unconcerned), and the attitudes toward privacy in COVID-19 times. The questionnaire was shared via websites and social networks. The data was collected between 27/08/2020 to 27/9/2020. We received and analyzed 258 responses. The initial pilot study found that almost 73% of the respondents were pragmatists or unconcerned about privacy when it came to sharing their private data. Comparable results were obtained with other privacy studies that have employed PSI.

A survey of 16 private banks are included in the study. Based on the regression analysis results, capital structure variables and some bank-specific characteristics explain a substantial part of the variations in bank profitability. Higher profitability measures of ROA and net interest margin tend to be associated with relatively higher total and short-term debt ratios, loan to deposit ratios, and credit risks. Besides, older banks are in a better position than younger counterparts in terms of profitability. The impact of size is found to be significantly negative, at least for the ROA model, implying that Ethiopian private banks are operating below their optimal capacity.

We posit that ownership structure plays a key role in productivity. However, ownership structure has an effect on productivity which changes with a firm's age. Ownership structure that is optimal for new firms may not be optimal for older firms. We here consider the impact of ownership structure as defined by shares of individuals' versus (broadly defined) institutional ownership. Our empirical counterpart draws on the UK company data for 2008-2017, obtained from the Orbis database. Our key explanatory variables are the joint share of the individual owners in equity and its square, but we also control concentration of ownership indices, along with a range of other firm-level characteristics. Applying fixed effects models along with instrumenting ownership with regional level variables, we found that new companies with majority individual owners and minority institutional owners outperform others. As firms age, however, these differences begin to disappear, with individual owners losing their control-related advantage. The results of the relative advantage of individual owners in the early stage is consistent with the property rights theory, which emphasises that residual control rights should remain with those whose investment is critical. It can be argued, however, that for whom the investment is critical changes as firm ages. Our managerial implications emphasise ownership competence in optimising ownership structure, which should evolve along the stages of the life-cycle of the firm. © 2021 Tomas Bata University in Zlín.

The piece explains the basic tenets for CxPP execution and upkeep. It also explains the methods used to create, evaluate and monitor the CxPP initiative while illustrating the ways in which the initiative functions and adds value to any firm implementing it. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilizes a descriptive approach to explain the basic tenants of the CxPP initiative. The paper utilizes the define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) framework to explain the tenets of the CxPP initiative. Each section of the paper utilizes descriptions of internal processes and research to further explain and justify implementation of the CxPP imitative across firms. Moreover, the piece explains the methods used to create, evaluate and monitor the CxPP initiative while illustrating the ways in which the initiative functions and adds value to the firm. Findings: According to JJV Quality Assurance experts, the CxPP initiative is a long-term approach that supports synergy across departments to enhance product quality, improve customer satisfaction and protect sales. By implementing the CxPP approach, JJV was able to uncover and solve four distinct defect categories that affect product quality and customer experience, thus demonstrating the importance and benefits of the CxPP initiative for any organization. Research limitations/implications: Due to the chosen research approach, the study lacks specificity. As a result, it is recommended that future implementation of the proposed initiative opts for more testable propositions. Practical implications: Due to competitive considerations, note that no empirical data will be shared in the findings. The scaling of the principles of this approach should be universal. But the execution; types of projects, type of customer need and feedback should be specific to each environment.

The first two stages in the model use judgement criteria related to supplier characteristics and supplier fit, gathered from managers to create a portfolio that optimizes supplier rank and fit scores. In the third stage we optimize cost by considering landed costs for each supplier in the portfolio to arrive at the final set of suppliers. The results indicate that the criteria used, and the staged refinement of the supplier pool resulted in a better fit than just considering the landed costs of the final pool of suppliers without rank and fit score constraints. The proposed method will enable purchasing managers to strategically create a supplier portfolio that will suit the retailer’s needs more effectively. © 2021 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","knapsack problem; retail decision support; supplier portfolio; supplier selection","Decision support systems; Managers; Decision support models; Knapsack model; Model use; Retail industry; Supplier portfolios; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102576587

If tangible investments predominated in the past, most investments are intangible at present, meaning that money is spent on buying and creating knowledgebased products, including computer software, research and development, design, works of art, market research, learning, and new business processes. The authors attempt to answer why the economy in which intangible assets are intensively used is so different from the economy where tangible assets dominate. The authors conclude that these changes are explained by the basic properties of the intangible assets and have resulted in long-lasting stagnation, lower economic growth, increasing inequality, and difficulties in public policies for economic and financial sectors. © 2021 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

When the item is sold through accepting/rejecting different fare classes, the tight competitive ratio for this problem has been established by Ball and Queyranne through booking limit policies, which raise the acceptance threshold as the remaining inventory dwindles. However, when the item is sold through dynamic pricing instead, there is the additional challenge that offering a low price may entice high-paying customers to substitute down. We show that despite this challenge, the same competitive ratio can still be achieved using a randomized dynamic pricing policy. Our policy incorporates the price-skimming technique originated by Eren and Maglaras, but importantly we show how the randomized price distribution should be stochastically increased as the remaining inventory dwindles. A key technical ingredient in our policy is a new “Valuation Tracking” subroutine, which tracks the possible values for the optimum, and follows the most “inventory-conservative” control, which maintains the desired competitive ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our policy in simulations, where its average-case performance surpasses all naive modifications of the existing policies.

To capture the interactions among the operator performance, government subsidies, and passengers in an urban rail transit system, a profit maximization model with nonnegative profit constraint is formulated to determine the optimal fare and headway solutions. Then, the social welfare that results from the operator profit maximization model is analyzed. Finally, a numerical example from Changsha, China, is employed to verify the feasibility of the proposed model. The major resultsconsist of optimized solutions for decision variables, i.e., the fares and train headways, as well as subsidies to the operator. The fare elasticity factor under two fare structures significantly affects fares and demand. As the fare elasticity factor increases, the social welfare gradually decreases and a deficit occurs at low fares and demand, while subsidies rise from 0 to ¥24658.00 and¥38089.16 under the flat fare and distance-based fare structures. © 2021 Qing Wang et al.",,"Elasticity; Profitability; Decision variables; Financial support; Government subsidies; Operator performance; Optimized solutions; Profit maximization; Urban rail transit; Urban rail transit systems; Light rail transit",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100639382

We look at financial and non-financial performance indicators and document significant effects on firm growth and labour cost efficiency, but rather fragile ones on accounting returns, such as profitability. We also document evidence of another threshold effect; namely, gender diversity appears to have its highest impact (its 'ceiling') when the proportion of female directors is approximately 30%.

However, in the context of the poorest countries in the world- those of Sub-Saharan Economies, formal SMEs contribute less than 20% to the macroeconomic bottom line (the number is around 60% for high-income countries). Part of the reason is the presence of a large informal sector of SMEs, where the Cost of Business Start-Up Procedures (CBSP) serves as one of the barriers to legitimization of SMEs. In this investigation, we use the framework of Networked Readiness Index (NRI) to investigate whether (1) ICT Capabilities impact CBSP, and (2) the value of CBSP is associated with the socio-economic impact of ICT Capabilities. We use a five-step methodology utilizing Cluster Analysis, Decision Trees Induction, Data Envelopment Analysis, Association Rules Mining, and Ordinary Least Squares regression to conduct the inquiry in the context of 26 SSA economies.

Using agricultural production as an example, we empirically investigate how past weather fluctuations affect economic decision-making by shifting agents’ subjective expectations over future climate. We find that agricultural producers do not form expectations on future climate using only long-run normals, and instead engage in a combination of heuristics, including the availability heuristic and the reinforcement strategy.

Our empirical approach estimates the standard DCM at varying spatial resolutions using both simulated data and vessel monitoring system data from the Gulf of Mexico longline fishery. We assess model performance using goodness-of-fit, predictive capacity, parameter estimates, and the assessment of the fishery response to a hypothetical marine protected area. Results show that, even when the specification of the decision-making process is correct, models can be structurally biased because of the aggregation of spatial scale that neglects the value of many fishing locations.

Previous research has typologized the tactics that firms might use in differing ways; among these have been tactics associated with individual products, those undertaken with partners, and whether a tactic is internally or externally focused. Yet there has been no systematic consideration of all the tactics firms might employ in protecting their brands. This research seeks to identify all the tactics that firms might use in a total business solution to brand protection. We gathered suggested tactics from 42 respondents (representing ranks such as managers, directors, vice presidents), 33 representing global, widely recognizable brand-owning firms and the remainder from universities or associations. Altogether, our respondents suggested 1,347 tactics, of which 756 were unique (many respondents from differing firms suggested similar tactics). Using a grounded-theory approach, we classified these tactics into 12 categories and dozens of subcategories. We found some differences in suggested tactics by firm size, as well as in depth and breadth of suggested tactics. More important, however, we found the role of brand protection is far greater than what previous research and taxonomies suggest. We confirm the presence of previous tactics, but identify many more as well, affirming the relevance of a total business solution. These included categories of tactics supporting each of the six principles of the total business solution: emphasizing prevention, proactivity, and strategy; identifying the infringer as the unseen competitor; creating and relying on performance metrics and using data and analysis to mitigate risk; creating a culture of continuous improvement and embracing learning; highlighting the value of internal and external controls and mechanisms for detecting and responding to infringements; and promoting a holistic approach that integrates and coordinates all parts of the firm for brand protection. Future research based on larger, random samples of a broader variety of firms may find still additional tactics or map these tactics to larger strategies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brand; counterfeit; management; organization; risk","Risk assessment; Brand protection; Business solutions; Continuous improvements; External control; Grounded theory approach; Holistic approach; Performance metrics; Vice president; Marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089527503

One efficient approach is to speed up logistics performance. To generate positive social externality in social welfare, the government can provide subsidies to faster—but also higher cost—logistics providers and encourage customers to choose these providers. This study examines the influence of government subsidies to railway logistics providers and consignors on market equilibrium. We find that subsidization affects the price, demand, and profits of logistics providers. However, the impact on demand and profits remains the same regardless of whether the subsidy is provided to the railway logistics provider or railway consignor. These results are consistent whether the transportation cost is subject to economics of scale or not. The profit of each logistics provider has a concave relationship with its own transportation time but a convex relationship with its competitor’s transportation time. The key factors that determine the optimal subsidy and its impact on social welfare include the unit operational cost of the railway logistics provider and the logistics provider's time-based differentiation and time values of consignors. In addition, the government provides the highest unit subsidy when the railway logistic provider optimizes its profit at the optimal transportation time. When customer demand is stochastic, we find both the fluctuation level of customers’ demand and the logistics providers’ risk attitude influence the government’s optimal subsidy amount. Providing an optimal subsidy helps to efficiently guide the competitive market and enhance social welfare. © 2019 Operational Research Society.","logistics service provider; social welfare; Subsidization; time-based competitiveness","Commerce; Competition; Profitability; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Sales; Stochastic systems; Government subsidies; Logistics providers; Logistics service provider; Optimal transportations; Social welfare; Subsidization; Time based; Transportation cost; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071489787

In this paper, we introduce a generalized parametric divisor method (GPDM), which generalizes most of the classical and widely used apportionment methods from the literature as special cases. Moreover, it allows for very flexible interpolation between previous methods by appropriately setting two parameters in the GPDM. We identify an inequity measure that the GPDM globally optimizes. We also identify two natural inequity measures for which an apportionment given by the GPDM is locally optimal. These results generalize similar results for classical apportionment methods, and justify the use of a large class of new apportionment methods given by the GPDM. From this class, we identify and recommend specific new methods. Our numerical experiments compare the apportionments given by the new methods with those given by existing methods using real data for the United States, Germany, Canada, Australia, England, and Japan. Explicit definition of the GPDM has enabled us to perform computational experiments for evaluating the unbiasedness of the GPDM using two standard measures while comparing with other traditional methods. Based upon our generalization technique and numerical experiments, we show that the GPDM outperforms all the traditional apportionment methods by selecting appropriate parameter values. Thus, we can conclude that the GPDM is the most “unbiased” and fairer if parameters can be agreed ex ante, and the GPDM is applicable to actual electoral voting systems. © 2018 The Authors.

However, to resolve bidder preference elicitation problems, CAs are conducted iteratively. Winner determination is a key bottleneck that restricted the widespread adoption of such iterative CAs. Time bounded winner determination is further complicated by the increased variety and velocity of bids each round, and so regular solvers such as IBM CPLEX and A Mathematical Programming Language have been demonstrably ineffective in determining winners within a short duration. In response, heuristic-based methods have enjoyed an increase in applicability. We add to the growing body of work in heuristic-based winner determination by proposing an ant colony–based anytime algorithm (traveling ants for combinatorial auctions, or TrACA) that produces optimal or near-optimal winner determination results within specified time. Experiments are performed on 94 open test instances that display a variety in bid-bundle composition. We show and compare the performance of TrACA to 20 most recent state-of-the-art heuristics and two of the best exact algorithms (CPLEX and Max W Clique). Compared with 12 of 20 heuristics that employ classic search (e.g., stochastic local search, tabu search) or genetic or memetic algorithms, TrACA does significantly better on all instances. On the other eight heuristics that employ advanced hybrid search methodologies (e.g., hyperheuristics, biased random keys), TrACA performs significantly better on the harder test instances. Additionally, we show that TrACA resolves the trade-off between time and accuracy by achieving optimal solutions on 76 out of 94 instances, in at most one-sixth the time taken by exact algorithms. Finally, we analyze the TrACA search process and highlight factors that make TrACA suitable for solving hard auction instances within a prespecified (short) duration. © 2021 INFORMS","algorithms; ant colony; design science; iterative combinatorial auctions; metaheuristics","Ant colony optimization; Economic and social effects; Graphic methods; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Mathematical programming; Stochastic systems; Ant colonies; Combinatorial auction; Design science; Exact algorithms; Graph-based; Iterative combinatorial auction; Metaheuristic; Short durations; Test instances; Winner determination; Tabu search",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134664597

To address this gap, we first develop a data science approach to detect customer misbehavior on social media and then devise intervention strategies to deter it. Specifically, we build on natural language processing and deep learning techniques to automatically detect customer misbehavior by mining customers’ social media activities in collaboration with a leading apparel firm. The results show that our algorithmic solution achieves superior performance, improving detection by 7%–9% compared with traditional methods. We then implement two types of intervention policies based on the focus theory of normative conduct that advocates the use of injunctive norms (i.e., a punishment policy) and descriptive norms (i.e., a common identity policy) to restrain customer misbehavior. We conduct field experiments with the firm to validate these policies. The experimental results indicate that punishment considerably reduces customer misbehavior in the short term, but this effect decays over time, whereas common identity has a smaller but more persistent effect on misbehavior reduction. In addition, punishing dysfunctional customers decreases their purchase frequency, whereas imposing a common identity increases it. Interestingly, our results show that combining the two policies effectively alleviates the detrimental effect of punishment, especially in the long run. We examine the heterogeneous treatment effect on novice and experienced customers.

The model is based on an incomplete information game and permits individual-specific parameters of consumers. It is challenging to apply this type of models to real-life scenarios for two reasons: (1) The computation of the Bayesian–Nash equilibrium is highly demanding; and (2) the identification of social influence requires the use of excluded variables that are oftentimes unavailable. To address these challenges, we derive the unique equilibrium conditions of the game, which allow us to employ a stochastic Bayesian estimation procedure that is scalable to large social networks. To facilitate the identification, we utilize community-detection algorithms to divide the network into different groups that, in turn, can be used to construct excluded variables. We validate the proposed structural model with the login decisions of more than 25,000 users of an online social game. Importantly, this data set also contains promotions that were exogenously determined and targeted to only a subgroup of consumers. This information allows us to perform exogeneity tests to validate our identification strategy using community-detection algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the managerial usefulness of the proposed methodology for improving the strategies of targeting influential consumers in large social networks. © 2021 The Author(s).","Bayesian estimation of games; Community detection; Network games; Online social networks; Social influence; Targeting","Bayesian networks; Economic and social effects; Population dynamics; Signal detection; Stochastic systems; Bayesian estimation of game; Bayesian estimations; Community detection; Community detection algorithms; Efficient estimation; Game of incomplete informations; Information applications; Network game; Social influence; Targeting; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124579702

Adding CG in forecasting regressions of bond excess returns significantly raises the R2, and restores countercyclical variation in bond risk premia that is otherwise missed by forward rates. Consistent with the argument that CG captures the effect of real imbalances on the path of rates, our factor has predictive ability for real bond excess returns. The importance of the gap remains robust out-ofsample and in countries other than the United States.

If investors are aware of these patterns, analysts' forecast revisions measured using the random walk expectation are an incomplete representation of changes in investors' earnings expectations. Investors can use knowledge of errors and biases in forecasts to improve upon the simple random walk expectation by incorporating conditioning information. Using data from 2005 to 2015, we compare associations between market-adjusted stock returns and alternative specifications of forecast revisions to determine which best represents changes in investors' earnings expectations. We find forecast revisions measured using a 'bandwagon expectations' specification, which includes two prior analysts' forecast signals and provides the most improvement over random-walk-based revision measures.

In response, boards have sought to enhance their IT competence levels. We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors’ ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms’ equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures. Our analysis of 107 operational IT failures in public U.S. firms provides support for this hypothesis, even after we address the potential endogeneity of board IT competence. © 2021","Board IT competence; IT risk governance; IT value-protection; Operational IT failures; Stock market reaction","Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Board IT competence; Cyber security; Ex antes; IT competence; IT risk governance; IT value-protection; Market reactions; Operational IT failure; Risk governance; Stock market reaction; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120667541

Our approach is two-pronged: we first examine whether the implied biomass, that is, the biomass that is consistent with a simple microeconomic model calibrated with observed prices and costs, offers an approximation of actual stock assessments—both agree over the first 20 years of observation, but diverge over the last five. In a second approach, we use annual data in Vector Autoregressive (VAR), Bayesian VAR (B-VAR), and Vector Error Correction (VEC) frameworks and add monthly data in a mixed-frequency data analysis including Mixed-Frequency Bayesian VAR (MF-BVAR) and Mixed-Data Sampling (MIDAS) frameworks for log-differenced time series.

We find a statistically significant correlation between biometric estimates and changes in a price-based indicator that is robust to the inclusion of confounding factors.

These learning opportunities consist of both induced opportunities, such as formal training efforts, and incidental opportunities due to surprises (i.e., events that violate expectations) encountered during problem solving activities. In this paper, we propose that these two types of team learning opportunities can result in method-driven learning (MDL) at the team level. Our data are collected using a unique longitudinal survey design spanning 31 weeks that involved 33 participants in five design for Six Sigma projects conducted in different behavioral healthcare organizations, yielding a total of 562 weekly survey responses. We examine two modes of surprises. Those occurring spontaneously (measured based on self-rated and coder-rated variables) and reflective surprises (measured as externally-induced treatments). Our results show that: 1) the proportion of surprises occurring spontaneously during problem solving activities is positively correlated with team learning (i.e., MDL); and 2) collective reflections on surprises also facilitate team learning. Furthermore, we find evidence that surprises occurring spontaneously can negatively moderate the effect of induced learning opportunities (measured as efforts expended on training) on team learning. However, we find no evidence of such a negative moderation effect for surprises from reflection. Overall, our paper develops a nuanced understanding about the direct and moderating effects of surprises on team learning in the behavioral healthcare context, thereby contributing not only to the quality management literature but also quality improvement practices in behavioral healthcare. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Design for Six Sigma projects; surprise; team learning","Health care; Human resource management; Process engineering; Quality management; Surveys; Design for Six Sigma; Formal training; Healthcare organizations; Learning opportunity; Longitudinal study; Longitudinal surveys; Moderating effect; Quality improvement; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114014282

Despite their relevance within the policy portfolio, there is an open academic debate on whether subsidies are effective for innovation. This is by no means related to a potential inadequacy of subsidies, but because the mechanisms of assignment may be unsatisfactory. We argue that this may be the case when subsidies are awarded to larger firms with a solid international and innovative trajectory or to those that know how toplay the system,” rather than to the most deserving firms and projects. To test whether this is the case, we use data from 17,866 applicants for innovation subsidies managed by the Valencian Institute of Competitiveness. We find that firms with specific knowledge accrued through previous submissions, public funding and grant consultancy or cluster location, are the main beneficiaries of public innovation support, generally at the expense of more promising candidates that lack the know-how to navigate a complex and often flawed process.

We conceptualize pursuing cost efficiency advantage as low-cost strategy and restraining rivalry through horizontal differentiation as focus strategy. Although we corroborate earlier Strategy research that each of these strategies alone may have a positive impact on firm profitability, we highlight that mechanisms driving the interaction of these two strategies are, in fact, nonadditive in nature, consistent with recent analytical work. Using the context of the scheduled U.S. passenger airline industry over two decades, we empirically show that combining a low-cost strategy with a focus strategy is, indeed, detrimental to firm profitability, which has important implications for scholarship and practice. Managerial Summary: Firms have effectively used low-cost or focus strategies to improve their performance. Our study demonstrates that although firms pursuing either strategy individually can benefit, pursuing these two generic strategies of low-cost and focus simultaneously actually hurts firms' profitability. In essence, we show that when firms pursuing a low-cost strategy already possess a cost efficiency advantage over their rivals for the full customer base, firms have nothing to gain by simultaneously limiting rivalry—through focusing on a smaller customer segment—and thus giving away revenue to rivals. Our insights regarding the combination of different generic strategies caution managers to not be misled by the performance gains of either low-cost and focus strategies individually, but to realize that these two in tandem actually may harm profitability. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","competitive advantage; cost efficiency; differentiation; generic strategy; rivalry","Air transportation; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Managers; Profitability; Customer segments; Firm Performance; Firm profitabilities; Generic strategies; Horizontal differentiations; Low-cost strategies; Passenger airlines; Strategy research; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104329950

Investment in information technology (IT) capabilities and synergy between various computerized systems has been argued as the resilient information system's enablers. The purpose of this study is to empirically quantify the influence of IT investment, integration and interoperability in recovering the CIS from a data disaster. Design/methodology/approach: An archival dataset sourced from a European Commission-sponsored survey of 773 hospitals across 30 countries in Europe is utilized to study the relationships. The study adopts a quasi-experimental research design approach where sample observations are weighted based on their propensity to be selected in treatment groups. The artificial weighing allows attaining a pseudo-random sample to counter the effects of selection bias. Findings: The study finds that hospitals with more than 5% of the budget dedicated to IT have 100% higher odds of recovering immediately from a critical data loss in comparison to those that have less than 1% investment in IT. The greater extent of IT integration significantly reduces the time to recover the CIS, while interoperability problems at the organizational level lessen the odds of immediate recovery by 19%. Interoperability problems at the technical and semantic levels do not significantly impact recovery times of the CIS. Originality/value: The study proposes several empirically quantified and scientifically tested recommendations for health-care providers for faster restoration of critical CIS operations post data loss. The differential impact of the interoperability problems at the technical, semantic and organizational levels has also been highlighted. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Clinical information system; Data disaster; Interoperability; IT investment; Operations continuity; System integration","Budget control; Data integration; Disasters; Health care; Hospitals; Information use; Integration; Investments; Medical information systems; Recovery; Restoration; Semantics; Clinical information system; Computerized systems; Design/methodology/approach; European Commission; Experimental research; Health care operations; Health care providers; Organizational levels; Interoperability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114511172

However, existing research findings are mixed. We contribute to the research field by analyzing original data from 457 large companies in Norway and the US, examining associations of the gender-composition on boards and in the actual Executive Committees. The predictions of in-group favoritism are partly supported in the US, but largely not supported for Norwegian companies with gender-balanced boards due to quotas. We argue that in-group favoritism is an incomplete explanation.

Because of the risk of supplier nonperformance, the buyer only awards the contract to a qualified supplier; meanwhile, the buyer can conduct supplier qualification screening at a cost to verify whether the entrant suppliers can perform the contract. Conventionally, the buyer would screen entrants before running an auction, that is, the prequalification strategy (PRE). We explore an alternative approach called postqualification strategy (POST), in which the buyer first runs an auction and then conducts qualification screenings based on the suppliers' auction bids. Our characterization of the dynamic structure of the suppliers' equilibrium bidding strategy enables the calculation of the buyer's expected cost under POST, which is computationally intractable without this characterization. We show analytically that POST is cheaper than PRE when the cost of conducting qualification screening is high, the number of entrant suppliers is large, or the entrants' chance of passing qualification screening is high. To quantify the benefit of POST, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study and find that using the cheaper option between PRE and POST provides significant cost savings over the conventional PRE-only approach. Furthermore, we leverage a revelation principle for multistage games to derive the optimal mechanism as a stronger benchmark for performance comparison. Although the optimal mechanism is theoretically optimal, we find that its complexity renders it difficult to implement in practice; but quite strikingly, the simple and practical approach of choosing the cheaper option between PRE and POST captures the majority of the benefit that the optimal mechanism can offer over PRE, highlighting the practical benefit of POST. © 2021 INFORMS.","Open-bid auction; Procurement; Qualification screening; Supplier asymmetry","Benchmarking; Contracts; Bid auction; Open-bid auction; Optimal mechanism; Pre-qualification; Procurement; Qualification screening; Resourcing; Supplier asymmetry; Supplier contract; Supplier qualification; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123432485

An increase in competition may then force managers to improve the productivity of the firm in order to ensure survival. While this hypothesis has received ample theoretical attention, empirical evidence is scarce, mainly because preferences of managers are typically unobserved. In this paper, we exploit the fact that a large literature has documented specific non-monetary preferences of family managers. Using Spanish firm-level data, we compare how family-managed and professionally-managed firms react to import competition shocks. We find that import competition leads to productivity increases in family-managed firms that are initially unproductive. Productivity improvements are driven by family management as opposed to family ownership or non-managing family members. Furthermore, we show that these managers increase efficiency by reducing material usage, which is consistent with them trying to increase their short-term cash flow in order to survive. Finally, productivity improvements seem to be particularly pronounced in multi-generational family firms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Family firms; Import competition; Managers; Productivity","competition (economics); firm ownership; import; management; preference behavior; productivity; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114417371

This area is equally important for both practitioners and academics. Studies in the environmental sustainability field have predominantly addressed the carbon footprint concerning stakeholders in the production/manufacturing industries. However, they lack a comprehensive and tangible description of greenness. So, this research contributes to the literature on sustainable supply chains by identifying the factors involved in greening a supply network (both upstream and downstream). This paper focuses on exploring the indicators of greenness to develop a framework of related indicators in modern businesses. A comprehensive scale is developed and empirically validated to measure the extent of greenness in service industries in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Based on interviews and survey results in the UAE service industry, the results indicate that greenness in a service supply chain has six underlying dimensions: “managing operations,” “reducing resource requirements,” “building eco-friendly infrastructures,” “green computing,” “avoiding risks and uncertainties,” and “monitoring utilities.” Identifying the indicators of greenness can help bridge the existing gaps in the literature and help to make green service supply chains in the UAE a reality. The research provides several implications for researchers and practitioners, as well as highlights areas for potential future research.

All the efficiency measures show increases in the first two deals but show significant decreases in the next two to three deals and substantial efficiency increases for the last two acquisitions. The efficiency losers are those that engage in just four mergers. Banks that undertake six to seven acquisitions recover their earlier efficiency losses to achieve a net 12.5% cumulative profit efficiency. The results of the market reaction model show that acquirers lose the most by the time they announce their third and fourth deals, 25.8% and 23.9% respectively, while targets gain the most when they acquire their fourth deal, 34.5%. The efficiency dynamics results show consistency with both the managerial hubris theory, where efficiency gains occur in early deals (first and second), and the learning theory where efficiency measures form a U-shape curve. These results show that the theories are complementary rather than contradictory. Moreover, frequent acquirers tend to be highly profitable, but most importantly they are externally attracted to finding targets with specific characteristics like a relatively small size, high percentage of operating assets, and a high cost efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency dynamics; Market reaction; Serial acquirers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103594728

Design/methodology/approach: Parametric stochastic frontier analysis is used to estimate bank efficiency; the Lerner index is used as the competition indicator; accounting ratios and a translog function are used to measure different types of risk and finally, the three-stage least square estimator is used to investigate the interrelationships. Findings: The results of this study show that the impact of competition on different types of risk is significant and positive, while there is a significant and positive impact of credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk on bank competition. In addition, the findings demonstrate that the interrelationships between efficiency and competition are significant and negative. The authors do not find any robust interrelationships between different types of risk and different types of efficiency; the authors find that diversification and higher levels of profitability reduce bank credit risk. The results suggest that a higher developed banking sector reduces the level of bank competition in China.

However, researchers remain divided about how important poverty traps are in explaining the range of poverty dynamics observed in various contexts. We build a theoretical model that integrates micro-, meso-, and macro-level poverty traps, allowing us to analyze the ways in which multiple layers of poverty traps interact and reinforce each other. Through this simulation model, markets and institutions arise endogenously and help certain individuals escape poverty, while others remain persistently poor. In addition to one’s own productivity and initial capital levels, we explore how individual opportunity and income can be heavily determined by market access and institutional factors beyond one’s control. Using simulation results from controlled experiments, we can identify the role played by meso- and macro-conditions (that correspond to local markets and country-wide institutions, respectively) in helping individuals escape poverty. Our results suggest that even in a parsimonious model—with optimizing, forward-looking agents operating in a world with only one trap at each level—local and national context matters immensely and combines to determine individual opportunity in complex ways. © 2021, The Author(s).","Economic growth; Multiple equilibria; Poverty traps",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114100234

It is a common problem that the lowest submitted bid significantly deviates from owner's estimate. This might result in project delay or cancellation, budget pressure, and cost overrun, which are problematic for both owner organizations and highway contractors. There is a need to enhance understanding of transportation agencies about the likelihood of underestimation. This research assessed relations of several potential drivers to explain and forecast the likelihood of underestimation. This research for the first time used concepts and methods from survival analysis and applied them into construction bidding process. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was developed which is capable of examining significance of variables representing characteristics of project, bidder, and external (environmental) market, and using them to predict the likelihood of underestimation in transportation projects. The results showed that number of bidders, number of pay items, total number of projects awarded in the same month at state level, project types, producer price index for construction machinery manufacturing, value of construction put in place for commercial, unemployment, and highly active contractors are significant drivers of likelihood of underestimation. This research contributes to the state of knowledge in construction bidding analysis by identifying drivers of the likelihood of underestimation and creating a Cox model to explain and predict the likelihood of underestimation using information available from the identified drivers. It is anticipated that the results will help transportation agencies better understand the extent of risk of deviation between low bids and owner's estimates, prepare more-accurate cost estimates and budgets, and develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies for successful project delivery. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bidding analysis; Cox regression; Owner's (engineer's) estimate; Survival analysis","Budget control; Construction equipment; Contractors; Cost estimating; Forecasting; Hazards; Highway engineering; Machinery; Project management; Regression analysis; Transportation routes; Construction biddings; Construction machinery; Producer price indices; Proportional hazards; Risk mitigation strategy; Survival analysis; Transportation agencies; Transportation projects; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112868871

However, preferences are ‘reason-blind’, obscuring the underlying values that shape them. Increasingly, values – concepts or beliefs about desirable end states or behaviours that transcend specific situations and guide behaviour – receive attention in environmental governance, but lack of clarity in values terminology could hamper communication and reduce the ability to successfully align governance. There is a need to disentangle preferences and values to examine whether ecosystem services preferences provide adequate information on people's values. Seychelles provides an interesting case to study the relationship between policy, preferences, and values, due to recent neoliberal economic restructuring and emergence of the blue economy. We conducted 50 semi-structured interviews with resource users (fishers, tourism operators) and 130 population-wide Portrait Values Questionnaires to explore differences across the population and examine the link between values and preferences. We find a disconnect between ecosystem services preferences and underlying values. Exploring people's reasons for prioritising ecosystem services can improve understanding of underlying values, contribute to reconciling conflict, and clarify impacts on communities. Newly introduced worldviews and values accompanying the blue economy have the potential to clash with collectivist values found in Seychelles.

To estimate happiness frontier and thereby happiness efficiency, we employ a Bayesian inference procedure organized around Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filtering techniques. In addition, we propose to consider individual-specific characteristics by estimating happiness efficiency models with individual-specific thresholds to happiness. This is the first study that treats happiness as a latent variable and departs from restrictions that happiness efficiency would be time invariant. Our results show that happiness efficiency is related to the welfare loss associated with potentially misusing the resources that British individuals have at their disposal. Key to happiness is to have certain personality traits, such as being agreeable and extravert as they assist efforts to enhance happiness efficiency. On the other hand, being neurotic impairs happiness efficiency. © 2021","Bayesian inference; Behavioural or; Happiness; Latent modelling","Bayesian networks; Inference engines; Monte Carlo methods; Bayesian inference procedure; Efficiency models; Frontier analysis; Longitudinal data; Particle Filtering; Personality traits; Sequential Monte Carlo; Time invariants; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101634134

Our results show that anchoring and adjustment can bias our judgments at relatively low levels of cognition. Additionally, we outline a process by which anchoring and adjustment biases individuals' judgments in perceptual domains. Our results indicate a process wherein individuals search for an answer by testing plausible answers, the search being biased by the anchor question. We show that this movement is dominated by adjustments to adjacent possible responses indicating a search process constrained by selective accessibility. This process account explains the extant data in numerical domains as well—thus providing a way for a potential resolution to the disagreement among different existing process accounts for the anchoring phenomenon. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","anchoring; insufficient adjustment; perceptual anchor; scale distortion; selective accessibility","adult; article; decision making; female; human; human experiment; male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099244658

We do so in a single stage that controls also for non-linearities, while we also allow for some key bank and country-specific variables to impact upon financial stability and volatility. Thus, we provide a new measure of financial stability by country, over time and also at a global level.

However, brick-andmortar (BAM) retailers have yet to utilize this important promotional strategy because it is difficult to predict consumer preferences as they travel in a physical space but remain anonymous and unidentifiable until checkout. In this paper, we develop such a recommender approach by leveraging the consumer shopping path information generated by radio frequency identification technologies. The system relies on spatial-temporal pattern discovery that measures the similarity between paths and recommends products based on measured similarity. We use a real-world retail data set to demonstrate the feasibility of this real-time recommender system and show that our approach outperforms benchmark methods in key recommendation metrics. Conceptually, this research provides generalizable insights on the correlation between spatial movement and consumer preference. It makes a strong case that the emerging location and path data and the spatial-temporal pattern discovery methods can be effectively utilized for implementable marketing strategies. Managerially, it provides one of the first real-time recommender systems for BAM retailers. Our approach can potentially become the core of the next-generation intelligent shopping environment in which the stores customize marketing efforts to provide real-time, location-aware recommendations. © 2021 INFORMS.","brick-and-mortar stores; location-aware recommendation; recommender systems","Location; Mortar; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Real time systems; Recommender systems; Retail stores; Sales; Brick-and-mortar store; Consumers' preferences; Location-aware; Location-aware recommendation; Marketing strategy; Online retailing; Product recommendation; Real- time; Spatial temporals; Temporal pattern discovery; Brick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132323605

Our study complements this research by examining the overlooked role of competitive advantage, facilitating implementation and securing profitability, a leadership responsibility. Globally wine businesses struggle with profitability, signalling the lack of competitive advantage. To understand the failure of strategy implementation in the wine business, we explored the influence of the perceived leadership style on employee satisfaction which affects the strategy implementation and business performance results of selected businesses in the South African wine industry. The South African wine industry exemplifies the global wine industry, and an under-researched context, was the setting for studying this problem. An exploratory qualitative case study collected data by interviewing participants from purposively selected businesses, which were content analysed. Leadership plays a significant role in shaping a competitive advantage. The reasons for the strategy implementation failure can be summarized as the thwarting of employees’ needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, which are the levers of motivation. These motivational needs can be addressed by effective coordination and cooperation, which are integral to the structural dimensions of organisation for implementing strategy. The structural dimensions of organisation for implementing strategy unlocks human competence to implement strategy, and harness competitive advantage. Autocratic leadership styles, more so than democratic leadership styles, have undermined the structural dimensions of organisation for implementing strategy. Structural dimensions of organisation for implementing strategy can thus serve as a tool enhancing competitive advantage and guide leadership to implement strategy to improve business performance. This study augments overlooked research on strategy in wine businesses, favouring technical and marketing agendas and provides leadership with practical tools to enhance competitive advantage, facilitating strategy implementation and securing much needed profitability. The main limitation of the study is its cross-sectional nature. Scholars can modify their research agendas to include strategy considerations in addition to technical and marketing issues. Practitioners can immediately use the proposed tools for change to shape a competitive advantage, facilitating strategy implementation and securing profitability, and so augment a solid product with a sound strategy. © Journal of Global Business and Technology.","competitive advantage; profitability; strategy implementation failure; structural dimensions of organisation for implementing strategy; Wine business",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127636940

The winning contractor realizes the noncost attribute upon the project’s completion and may “manipulate” it in a costless manner (if such a manipulation is beneficial to the contractor). The noncost attribute inflicts a disutility cost on the buyer. This procurement problem arises in situations such as highway construction projects, in which completion times are a major concern. We establish the significance of incorporating the possibility of manipulation in two ways: (1) Using an optimal mechanism obtained by ignoring the possibility of manipulation can generate perverse incentives for the winning contractor to engage in manipulation. (2) The privacy of the noncost estimates can generate information rent only because of the possibility of contractors’ manipulation. We further study the family of cost-sharing mechanisms as a nonmanipulable, easy-to-implement, and near-optimal solution to the buyer’s procurement problem. In a cost-sharing mechanism, the winning contractor is selected via a second-price auction and needs to reimburse a prespecified fraction—referred to as the cost-sharing fraction—of the buyer’s disutility cost upon completion of the project. We show that the cost-sharing fraction plays an unequivocal role in capturing the essential tradeoff between allocative inefficiency and information rent. We also characterize the optimal cost-sharing fraction and offer prescriptive guidelines on the choice of this fraction based on the second-moment information of the buyer’s belief distribution. Finally, we establish the theoretical performance guarantees for the optimal cost-sharing mechanism. © 2021 INFORMS","Cost sharing; Multidimensional mechanism design; Noncost attribute; Procurement","Contractors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Highway engineering; Machine design; Sales; Cost sharing; Cost sharing mechanism; Information rents; Mechanism design; Multidimensional mechanism design; Multidimensional mechanisms; Noncost attribute; Optimal costs; Procurement; Two-dimensional; Cost effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118193874

The investor learns from past prices and is subject to transaction costs. Our model generates significantly larger liquidity premia compared with a benchmark model with observable market shifts. The larger premia are driven primarily by suboptimal risk exposure, as turnover is lower under incomplete information. In contrast, the benchmark model produces (mechanically) high turnover and heavy trading costs. We provide empirical support for the amplification effect of incomplete information on the relation between trading costs and future stock returns. We also show empirically that such amplification is not driven by turnover. Overall, our results can help explain the large disconnect between theory and evidence regarding the magnitude of liquidity premia, which has been a longstanding puzzle in the literature. © 2020 INFORMS.","Incomplete information; Liquidity premia; Regime shifts; Transaction costs","Commerce; Investments; Risk management; Amplification effects; Benchmark models; Incomplete information; Regime shift; Risk exposure; Stock returns; Transaction cost; Unobservable; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114471934

This study uses a Cournot oligopoly model to examine the profitability of electric utility mergers in the presence of distributed renewable energy sources. We introduce two sector specific parameters that influence merger profitability: the rate at which renewable energy raises the marginal grid integration cost and the extent to which renewable energy reduces pollution intensity. Our model predicts that an increase in the first parameter reduces the profitability of profitable mergers while an increase in the latter increases the profitability of profitable mergers. We find that due to the strategic substitutability between renewable and non-renewable energy, an increase in energy produced from distributed sources reduces the profitability of profitable mergers and reduces losses from unprofitable mergers. Furthermore, we show that the variability in electricity produced from renewable sources induces utilities to produce more exacerbating the extent that extra renewable energy affects merger profitability. Results from the theoretical model are illustrated by simulating a hypothetical merger among investor-owned utilities in the PJM market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Emission tax; Grid integration; Mergers and acquisitions; Pollution intensity; Renewable energy","Competition; Electric utilities; Mergers and acquisitions; Merging; Pollution; Profitability; Cournot oligopoly; Electricity industry; Emission taxes; Grid integration; Oligopoly models; Pollution intensity; Regulatory change; Renewable energies; Renewable integration; Strategic options; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; electricity industry; energy market; merger; pollution tax; profitability; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110577824

This remuneration structure incentivizes them to stick to the median forecast but also to make bold forecasts when they perceive to have superior private information. We find that skewness in the distribution of expectations, potentially created by bold forecasts, predicts economic surprises across a wide range of US economic indicators in-sample and out-of-sample, confirming our hypothesis that forecasters behave strategically and possess private information. This strategic bias found in US economic forecasts is also exhibited in individual forecasters' data as well as in continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan. We show that it has been increasing both through time and in relation to the behavioral anchor bias. Our results suggest that the pervasiveness of the biases depends on the popularity of the economic indicator being released, both in the United States and internationally. © 2021 The Authors.

A Monte Carlo study illustrates the overviolation problem and the effectiveness of the adjustment. An application to Fama–French portfolios returns series highlights the need to further account for tail behavior in the data. Applying the adjustment to the normal distribution performs relatively well for a less prudential level (5% VaR), but is unable to provide enough buffer to overcome the overviolation for more prudential levels (1% or 0.5%VaR).

When a new market disrupts a firm's standing routines, greater operating experience with these routines complicates adaptation and increases the firm's uncertainty about the feasibility of entering, thereby delaying its entry. Yet, this entry uncertainty simultaneously prompts the firm to rely more heavily on learning from the observation of others entering which, in turn, hastens its entry. Patterns are opposite for firms that can leverage their standing routines into the new market. Here, greater operating experience and resultant momentum to extrapolate existing routines reduce a firm's uncertainty about the feasibility of entry. This directly accelerates their entry but also diminishes the indirect, accelerating influence of observational learning. Because of these opposite dynamics, entry rates between firms with these different types of prior operating experience begin to diminish. Empirical analysis of entry patterns into the deregulation-created electric power trading market supports our theory and calls for modifications to previous expectations of prior operating experience exerting either a purely delaying or accelerating effect on entry, and, further, draws attention to the indirect pathways through which prior experience shapes entry patterns. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.",,"corporate strategy; feasibility study; learning; market system; numerical model; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121125778

In this paper we consider a very large class of DEA models based on arbitrary polyhedral technologies, which includes almost all known convex DEA models. We highlight the fact that the conventional interpretation of the optimal input and output weights in such models is generally incorrect, which raises a question about the meaning of multiplier models. We address this question and prove that the optimal solutions of such models show the DMU under the assessment in the best light in comparison to the entire technology, but not necessarily in comparison to the set of observed DMUs.

For example, with firms such as electric utilities, one must model the production of good and bad outputs using good and bad inputs. Typically, all inputs and outputs are potentially endogenous. In previous work, we show how to identify a DTDF system using price equations based on profit maximization and compute optimal directions for measuring productivity change. However, this work has not imposed restrictions that limit substitution possibilities among inputs and outputs to a feasible set that is consistent with materials-balance constraints. Such constraints require that the weight of all inputs equals the weight of all outputs. The major innovation of this paper is that we include two types of functional relationships that impose the parametric analog of materials balance by modeling the generation of bad outputs and the use of bad inputs. The first requires that bad outputs are functionally related to good inputs and bad inputs. The second requires that bad inputs are functionally related to good inputs. We illustrate these methods using a balanced panel of 80 U.S. coal-fired electric generating plants from 1995–2005. Substantial differences are observed between the specification that includes the materials-balance constraints and the conventional approach that omits them, based on Bayes factors as well as measures of productivity and inefficiency. For many plants, improved management practices can reduce substantial inefficiencies in meeting emission constraints without reducing productivity growth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Directional technology distance function; Materials-balance equations; Productivity and competitiveness; Productivity change with goods and bads","Electric utilities; Conventional approach; Directional technology; Electric generating plant; Emission constraints; Functional relationship; Management practices; Multiple input and multiple outputs; Productivity changes; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099345611

In experiments, these comparisons have encouraged pro-environmental behaviors among consumers. Consumers, however, are not the only sources of environmental externalities. Firms and other organizations also damage the environment. Yet organizations may not respond to peer comparisons in the same way that consumers respond because organizations have different objectives, constraints, and decision-making processes. In a pre-registered field experiment with 328 municipal wastewater treatment facilities in Kansas, we randomly sent some facilities a certified letter that contrasted, using text and a graphic, each facility’s discharge behavior to the behaviors of other facilities in the state. We estimate the effect of these peer comparisons on the degree to which the recipient facilities complied with discharge limits under the U.S. Clean Water Act. On average, letter recipients reported discharge ratios 8% lower than non-recipients in the eighteen-month period after letters were sent (95% CI [-15%, -1%]), although we cannot detect an effect in all post-treatment quarters.

We then examine the impact of the relationship among the workload, service time, arrival rate, and the chance of return on the dynamics of the system using a fluid approach. We first characterize all equilibria of the system and show that the system may shift between several equilibrium states. We establish that all equilibria can be easily determined and demonstrate conditions under which an equilibrium is stable. We then prove that, surprisingly, the stability of an equilibrium and the congestion in the system may depend on the amount of time a customer spends outside of the system before returning for rework. However, we show that if the relationship between the workload and service time in a system facing a single class of customers is nondecreasing, the long-run behavior of the system is not affected by how long it takes until a customer returns. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","equilibrium analysis; fluid approximation; Markov chain; state-dependent queueing network","Facings; Markov chains; Queueing networks; Recurrent neural networks; Arrival rates; Equilibrium state; Long-run behavior; Multi-server; Re-turn-on; Service systems; Service time; State dependent service; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086238622

Exchanges typically operate as electronic limit order books under a price-time priority rule and, in turn, can be modeled as multiclass first-in-first-out queueing systems. A market with multiple exchanges can be thought as a decentralized, parallel queueing system. Heterogeneous traders that submit limit orders select the exchange (i.e., the queue), in which to place their orders by trading off financial considerations against anticipated delays until their orders may fill. These limit orders can be thought of as jobs waiting for service. Simultaneously, traders that submit market orders select which exchange (i.e., queue) to direct their order. These market orders trigger instantaneous service completions of queued limit orders. In this way, the server is the aggregation of self-interested, atomistic traders submitting market orders. Taking into account the effect of investors’ order-routing decisions across exchanges, we find that the equilibrium of this decentralized market exhibits a state space collapse property whereby (a) the queue lengths at different exchanges are coupled in an intuitive manner; (b) the behavior of the market is captured through a one-dimensional process that can be viewed as a weighted aggregate queue length across all exchanges; and (c) the behavior at each exchange can be inferred via a mapping of the aggregated market depth process that takes into account the heterogeneous trader characteristics. The key driver of this coupling phenomenon is anticipated delay as opposed to the queue lengths themselves. Analyzing a trade and quote data set for a sample of stocks over a one-month period, we find empirical support for the predicted state space collapse.

The methodology followed a participatory action research approach with a sample group consisting of three durian-related enterprises, namely the Community Enterprise of Ban Batoo Puteh Quality Development, Yala Agricultural Marketing Co-Operative Limited, and the Fruit Processing Group of the community enterprise in Bannang Sata district. Data were collected via interview and group discussion, while data analysis involved data explanation and description. The results revealed that the development of a management system for adding to the competitiveness of Yala’s agro-community enterprises consists of the development of organizational structure, the member system, and a development plan management system. It was also found that the development of the potential of agro-community enterprise relates to adding value to the market share of durian by applying the concept of integration through the supply chain and value chain.

Management partners may be providing a valuable service in facilitating the transition to population health management. Alternately, in some cases, partners may be receiving high fees relative to the value of services provided. Purpose The aim of this study was to use qualitative data to identify motivations for and critical issues in alliances between ACOs and management partners. Methodology/Approach We used qualitative data collected from seven ACOs (193 semistructured interviews and observational data from 12 site visits) to characterize the alliances between management partners and providers in ACOs. Results We found that ACOs sought partners to provide financing, technical expertise, and risk bearing. Tensions in partnerships arose around resources (e.g., delivery on promised resources), control (e.g., who holds decision making authority), and values (e.g., commitment to safety net mission). Some partnerships persisted, whereas others dissolved. We found that there are two different underlying models of ACO-management partner alliances in our sample: (1) short-term partnerships aimed at organizational learning and (2) long-term partnerships based on complementarity. Conclusion Our results demonstrate how ACO alliances with management partners have unfolded as a kind of natural experiment in value-based payment reform. We expect that there is wide variation in quality, expertise, and delivery by management partners. Now multiple years into many of these alliances, we may address their value, strengths, and weaknesses from the perspective of providers as well as policy makers and payers. Practice Implications Accountable care organization providers must determine whether a management partner is the best solution to the challenges they face and, if so, which alliance model to pursue. Policymakers and payers should consider short- and long-term implications of ACO-management partner alliances, including considering changing the regulatory environment. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","accountable care organizations; management partners; organizational learning; strategic alliances","accountable care organization; article; decision making; financial management; learning; motivation; semi structured interview; tension",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108095045

In many network optimization problems presence of obstacles prohibits feasibility of a regular network design. This includes a wide range of applications including disaster relief and pandemic disease containment problems in healthcare management. We focus on this application since fast and efficient allocation of suppliers to demand nodes is a critical process that impacts the results of the containment strategy. In this study, we propose an integrated mixed-integer program with location-based capacity decisions that considers customer priorities in the network design. We propose an efficient multi-stage genetic algorithm that solves the problem in continuous space.

The theory is based on proportional representation within geographic areas, defined as each area's female-owned proprietorship count divided by its total proprietorship count. Analyzing survivorship of over one million proprietorships, we find a robust positive relationship between proportional representation and survival. We then examine effects of local stakeholders such as banks, customers, and network opportunities, in combination with proportional representation. Our research suggests that the effects of female proportional representation are more pervasive than previously considered, influenced by communities of business stakeholders, and, in some cases, leveling the playing field for female entrepreneurs. Managerial summary: We analyzed relative survival duration of one million female- and male-owned proprietorship businesses. We argued that a higher proportional representation of female business owners among all owners in a geographical area would combat negative stereotypes about women's business competence. We found that female-owned businesses survived relatively longer than their male-owned counterparts in areas with substantial proportional representation of female owners and that the relative benefits for women were magnified in the presence of local banks (which provide capital) as well as in customer-rich and network-rich areas. Business ownership has been proposed to be a “great equalizer” for women frustrated by the glass ceilings of corporate employment. We find this is true, but only in areas with a high proportional representation of women among business owners. © 2021 Strategic Management Society","geography; small business; stakeholders; survivorship; woman-owned business","Management; Planning; Business owners; Business ownership; Female entrepreneurs; Geographic areas; Geographical area; Glass ceiling; Playing fields; Small business; Glass industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100209920

Compared with acquisitions initiated by acquirers from developed economies, little is known about the possible determinants of completion or abandonment of CBAs conducted by EMFs. This paper investigates what contributes to the successful completion of CBAs by EMFs. Based on data of 637 announced CBAs by Chinese firms during 2000–17, we find that investing firms’ self-learning experience from previous acquisitions can significantly increase the completion rate of subsequent related CBAs, while their industrial spillover experience helps raise the completion rate of unrelated CBAs. Our findings also show that the value of acquisition experience is significant only when the target firm is domiciled in countries with comparable level of institutional quality. Our results provide new insights into the complexity of the global M&A market and lessons for EMFs intending to conduct CBAs in the future. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","acquisition experience; cross-border acquisitions; emerging market; institutional environment","capital market; cross-border relations; economic development; economic growth; firm size; institutional framework; investment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099063046

With a focus on assessment centers, interviews, situational judgment tests, and work samples as alternative methods, the results indicated that consonant with the construct/method distinction, the effectiveness of a method in reducing subgroup differences is a function of the constructs assessed. Specifically, there are larger White-African American subgroup differences that favor Whites for cognitive constructs on paper-and-pencil tests compared to the alternative methods; and most notably, the opposite result was obtained for noncognitive constructs such that, compared to paper-and-pencil assessments, substantially larger White-African American subgroup differences were observed for alternative methods. A similar pattern of results was obtained for White-Hispanic comparisons, albeit based on a smaller number of data points. In summary, the study's results indicate that the ubiquitously asserted effectiveness of the method-change approach for reducing subgroup differences is overstated, with said effectiveness depending on the construct assessed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","adverse impact; alternative predictor methods; cognitive constructs; noncognitive constructs; subgroup differences","African American; article; bone; Caucasian; consonant; decision making; Hispanic; human; human experiment; interview; meta analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090939466

First, using threshold nonlinear regression, we document a significant relationship between the laggards to leaders sentiment proxy and sectoral returns. Our findings reveal that aggregate returns in the sector are affected by activities of investors who embark on profit-taking when there is an increase in the proportion of lagging to leading stocks beyond the threshold value. Secondly, when using the growth opportunity sentiment proxy, we report that the increase in growth above the growth threshold value has a significant impact on sector returns. This study further confirms significant impact of non-threshold variables on sector groupings. Our findings are robust, having been subjected to a range of robustness checks. © 2020 The Authors.

Existing studies examining the relationship between the political cycle and pollution assume that local officials have perfect information on the turnover timing. We relax this crucial assumption by explicitly accounting for a turnover anticipation effect which we proxy via a nonparametric model. Based on city panel data, we find that there is a spike in air pollution in the year prior to the leadership turnover, but only if the turnover is anticipated by the incumbent. Beyond this cyclical anomaly, less frequent turnovers are generally conducive to lower air pollution. A key contribution of this study is the incorporation of the anticipation effect, which turns out to be critical for understanding the effect of turnover on air pollution.

How CS employees apply sophisticated CRM systems to interact with customers and how the mechanisms through which their CRM usage affects customer satisfaction vary across service channels and bear important implications. We approach these issues by investigating the concept of infusion use, defined as CS employees’ assessment of the extent to which they use a CRM system to its fullest potential to best support their work in the CRM-enabled service interaction context. Drawing on the IS success framework and expectation confirmation theory, we first formulate a baseline model that explains the direct and indirect mechanisms through which CS employees’ infusion use of CRM systems leads to customers’ expectation confirmation, which in turn affects customers’ satisfaction. We then draw on the lenses of media richness and communication adaptation to theorize why these two mechanisms exert differential influence in face-to-face and virtual channels. We test the hypotheses by collecting multiwave data from CS employees, customers, and firm archives of a Fortune 500 telecom service firm. We find that (1) CS employee infusion use can directly contribute to customer expectation confirmation and indirectly do so through CS employees’ satisfaction with the system (i.e., user satisfaction), and (2) the direct mechanism plays a more critical role in the face-to-face channel, whereas the indirect mechanism is more important in the virtual channel. Our findings inform managers of the avenues through which employees’ infusion use promotes CRM-enabled service success across face-to-face and virtual service channels. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

The insurance industry is an essential sector in any developed economy and a better understanding of customers’ risk profile is critical to decision making in all aspects of insurance operations. In this paper, we explore the idea of using copula-based dependence models to learn the hidden risk of policyholders in property insurance. Specifically, we build a novel copula model to accommodate the dependence over time and over space among spatially clustered property risks. To tackle the computational challenge caused by the discreteness feature of large-scale insurance data, we propose an efficient multilevel composite likelihood approach for parameter estimation. Provided that latent risk induces correlation, the proposed customer learning method offers improved predictive analytics by allowing insurers to borrow strength from related risks in predicting new risks and also helps reveal the relative importance of the multiple sources of unobserved heterogeneity in updating policyholders’ risk profile. In the empirical study, we examine the loss cost of a portfolio of entities insured by a government property insurance program in Wisconsin. We find both significant temporal and spatial association among property risks. However, their effects on the predictive distribution of loss cost are different for the new and renewal policyholders. The two sources of dependence are complements for the former and substitutes for the latter. These findings are shown to have substantial managerial implications in key insurance operations such as experience rating, capital allocation, and reinsurance arrangement.

Based on return decomposition theory, I predict that losses contain information not only about future cash flows (i.e., cash flow news) but also, about risk (i.e., expected returns and discount rate news). However, these informational components have offsetting valuation effects, resulting in a muted ERC. Consistent with the prediction, I show that, after controlling for information about risk (mainly expected returns), the ERC of losses becomes statistically significant with more negative returns for larger losses when returns are measured either annually or around earnings announcements. Moreover, loss firms will continue to have poor future earnings and operating cash flows, and larger losses are associated with more negative analyst forecast revisions in the loss-reporting year. I also document that losses provide more negative cash flow information when they are not because of research and development expensing, when they trigger operational curtailments, and when they are less likely to reverse to profits. Further tests confirm the robustness of my findings to considering future return drifts/reversals, alternative proxies for expected returns and discount rate news, alternative test portfolios, and alternative model specifications. Overall, my paper provides new insights into the information content of losses.

In such cases, the planning system's allocations often entail trade-offs between the service providers' welfare and the total value that is generated (or that accrues to the system itself), and concern arises that allocations that are good under one metric may perform poorly under the other. We propose a broad framework for quantifying the magnitude of value losses when allocations are restricted to satisfy certain desirable guarantees to the service providers. We consider a general class of guarantees that includes many considerations of practical interest arising (e.g., in the design of sustainable two-sided markets) in workforce welfare and compensation, or in sourcing and payments in supply chains, among other application domains. We derive tight bounds on the relative value loss and show that this loss is limited for any restriction included in our general class. Our analysis shows that when many providers are present, the largest losses are driven by fairness considerations, whereas when few providers are present, they are driven by the heterogeneity in the providers' effectiveness to generate value; when providers are perfectly homogenous, the losses never exceed 50%. We study additional loss drivers and find that less variability in the value of jobs and a more balanced supply-demand ratio may lead to larger losses. Lastly, we demonstrate numerically using both real-world and synthetic data that the loss can be small in several cases of practical interest.

Unfortunately, it is well known that it is impossible to combine all three properties of truthfulness, efficiency, and fairness (i.e., envy freeness) in matching with preferences. Established mechanisms are either efficient or envy free, and the efficiency loss in envy-free mechanisms is substantial. We focus on a widespread representative of a matching problem: course assignment where students have preferences for courses and organizers have priorities over students. An important feature in course assignment is that a course has both a maximum capacity and a minimum required quota. This is also a requirement in many other matching applications, such as school choice, hospital-residents matching, or the assignment of workers to jobs. We introduce Extended Seat Prioritized Clinch and Trade with a widened Range of guarantees (RESPCT), a mechanism that respects minimum quotas and is truthful, efficient, and has low levels of envy. The reduction in envy is significant and is due to two remarkably effective heuristics. We follow a design science approach and provide analytical and experimental results based on field data from a large-scale course assignment application. These results have led to a policy change, and the proposed assignment system is now being used to match hundreds of students every semester.

With new outbreaks emerging, hospitals are now figuring out how to balance preparedness for future COVID-19 waves with their elective and regular services. This report discusses how four hospital systems deal with these dual responsibilities in China, Norway and the UK. Reflections Based on the experiences and combined reflections of hospital executives, we have formulated five strategic and leadership lessons for hospitals as they manage these dual responsibilities. (1) Redesign organisation to separate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 services both within and across hospitals. (2) Expand virtual care strategies to improve access. (3) Use data-driven models to allocate resources across COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. (4) Invest in programmes to promote frontline staff well-being. (5) Secure financial support to continue to deliver on the dual responsibilities. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic gives rise to leadership challenges that have fuelled organisational change and new approaches to healthcare delivery. Leading hospitals during the pandemic is a balancing act -providing care for both patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, while at the same time preparing for the next waves of the pandemic. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

While we find the relation between SOX and R&D risk-taking is sensitive to research design choices, we find a consistent positive relation between SOX and Research Quotient. Our evidence indicates that while firms may allocate fewer resources to R&D post-SOX, they concurrently manage their R&D investments more productively.

Using both a theoretical model of a regulated fuel industry and a numerical model of the U.S. fuel market, we show that cost containment mechanisms can have the benefit of both constraining compliance costs and limiting deadweight loss.

This paper is the first attempt to explore the factors impacting Less-than-Truckload (LTL) freight load factors at a disaggregated level to the best of our knowledge. The paper analyzes the operation data provided by a leading LTL logistics company in China, using the beta regression finite mixture models. The results show that the under-loaded tours and over-loaded tours behave differently in terms of load factor determination. All variables' impacts vary across the different components, confirming the need to analyze these two scenarios separately using finite mixture models. For under-loaded tours, high shipping demand and the use of small vehicles are always positively and significantly associated with the load factor. For over-loaded LTL tours, the effects of transportation distance and leased vehicles are always positive and significant. Finally, implications for operations strategies and public policies are discussed based on the estimated results. These findings shed light on an in-depth understanding of LTL freight load factors and provide essential references for LTL logistics companies, transportation planners, policymakers, and researchers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Beta regression finite mixture model; Load factor; Over-loaded tour; Under-loaded tour","finite element method; numerical model; regression analysis; strategic approach; transportation planning; transportation policy; transportation safety; trucking; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104315240

Our model requires no demand forecasting; however, because of the presence of the stochastic component, we can partially predict future demand as the sequence of arrivals unfolds. Under the proposed model, we study the problem of the online allocation of a single resource to two types of customers and design online algorithms that outperform existing ones. Our algorithms are adjustable to the relative size of the stochastic component; our analysis reveals that as the portion of the stochastic component grows, the loss due to making online decisions decreases. This highlights the value of (even partial) predictability in online resource allocation.We impose no conditions on how the resource capacity scales with the maximum number of customers. However, we show that using an adaptive algorithm-which makes online decisions based on observed data-is particularly beneficial when capacity scales linearly with the number of customers. Our work serves as a first step in bridging the long-standing gap between the two wellstudied approaches to the design and analysis of online algorithms based on (1) adversarial models and (2) stochastic ones. Using novel algorithm design, we demonstrate that even if the arrival sequence contains an adversarial component, we can take advantage of the limited information that the data reveal to improve allocation decisions.We also study the classical secretary problem under our proposed arrival model, and we show that randomizing over multiple stopping rules may increase the probability of success. © 2021 INFORMS.","Analysis of algorithms; Competitive analysis; Online resource allocation","Adaptive algorithms; Resource allocation; Sales; Stochastic models; Demand forecasting; Design and analysis; Limited information; Multiple stopping; On-line algorithms; Probability of success; Secretary problem; Stochastic component; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109179091

Currently, most investment estimation researches render the point value results, which could lead to considerable uncertainty in the estimation results and increase the risk of decision-making. Therefore, it is essential to explore a type of systematic, accurate, and effective estimation method. This study proposed an innovative estimation method of probability interval prediction based on the distribution of prediction errors. First, the dimension reduction of the construction indexes was conducted by using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Then, a model was developed based on the fusion of the support vector regression (SVR) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Finally, cost intervals with different confidence levels were obtained on the basis of kernel density estimation (KDE). The case results indicated that when the confidence was 95%, the comprehensive evaluation index coverage width-based criterion (CWC) and the interval coverage rate PICC of the cost estimation were 2.17 and 93.33%, respectively. Hence, the proposed interval prediction model was fairly reliable, which could provide practical guidance for the investment decisions in the early stage of construction projects and give the decision makers more abundant forecasting information. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Confidence interval; Cost prediction; Error distribution; Grey wolf optimization (GWO); Nonparametric estimation; Support vector regression (SVR)","Factor analysis; Forecasting; Investments; Predictive analytics; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Support vector regression; Comprehensive evaluation index; Construction projects; Dimension reduction; Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA); Investment decisions; Kernel Density Estimation; Probability intervals; Support vector regression (SVR); Cost estimating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101697569

An intertemporal model of Dutch disease indicates that if the tradable sector is politically dominant then an oil discovery can induce protectionism. If the economy is also credit constrained, this effect is intensified upon discovery, but partially reversed when oil revenues start to flow. We test these predictions using 16.2 million, HS-6 level, bilateral tariff rates that cover 5718 products in 155 countries over the period 1988–2012, and data on worldwide discoveries of giant oil and gas fields. Our identification strategy rests on the exogeneity of the timing of discoveries. Our empirical results indicate that an oil discovery increases tariffs during pre-production years and decreases tariffs in the years to follow yet to a lesser extent, most notably in capital scarce economies with a relatively dominant tradable sector. Our baseline estimates indicate that a giant oil field discovery induces a rise of approximately 13% in the average tariff over the course of 10 years; this increase is approximately 2.5 times larger during the pre-production period when the oil discovery represents a pure news shock. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Capital scarcity; Dutch disease; News shocks; Oil discoveries; Political economy; Protectionism; Trade policy","International trade; Oil fields; Dutch disease; Identification strategies; Oil and gas fields; Oil discoveries; Oil field discovery; Oil revenues; Pre-production; Petroleum industry; numerical model; oil field; protectionism; tariff structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101334069

We employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag modelling technique to examine the relationship among the variables. Models with technology, energy use, and a combination of technology and energy were considered, respectively. Only Nigeria recorded a positive and significant impact of technology on its agricultural value addition in both the short run and long run in the first model. In the second model, energy use positively and significantly influenced agricultural value addition in two countries (Botswana and South Africa) in the short run. However, the long-run coefficients of energy use were found to be positive and significant for Benin and South Africa. In the third model, short-run coefficients of technology were largely positive but statistically insignificant across the countries, while its long-run coefficient was largely positive but only statistically significant for Nigeria. Also, the short-run effect of energy use remained positively significant for Botswana and South Africa as observed in the earlier model. However, its long-run effect was only positive and statistically significant in three countries (Benin, South Africa, and Togo). Thus, the study recommends the need for huge investment in technology and energy use as well as the sensitisation of local farmers in adopting technology to further enhance the quality of their output. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Energy; Technology; Value addition","agricultural application; agricultural technology; energy use; numerical model; regression analysis; Benin [West Africa]; Botswana; Nigeria; South Africa; Togo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087553801

We use very detailed historical data on the tobacco consumption in 62 Italian provinces from 1871 to 1888 to estimate a differentiated product demand system. The demand conditions and the legal environment of the period made this market as close to a textbook monopoly as is practically possible. The government's stated aim for this industry was profit maximization: since at the time profits from tobacco were close to 10% of the revenues for the cash-strapped government, the stated aim was very likely the true one. Our empirical application uses historical price and cost data, and suggests that the government was not wide off the mark: the tobacco prices were 'not far' from those dictated by the multiproduct monopoly formulae for profit maximization with interdependent demand functions. © 2020 Oxford University Press 2020.

Initially, no social class invests in higher education, and inequality is driven by wealth accumulation/bequests. Once the rich surpass a certain income threshold, they invest in higher education and their children's incomes start to grow faster. Over time, the middle class and, potentially, the poor follow suit.

These findings stimulate the needs for more practical non-Poisson customer arrival models, and more importantly, new staffing formulas to account for the autocorrelative features in the arrival model. For this purpose, we study a multiserver queueing system where customer arrivals follow a doubly stochastic Poisson point process whose intensities are driven by a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process. The nonnegativity and autoregressive feature of the CIR process makes it a good candidate for modeling temporary dips and surges in arrivals. First, we devise an effective statistical procedure to calibrate our new arrival model to data which can be seen as a specification of the celebrated expectation–maximization algorithm. Second, we establish functional limit theorems for the CIR process, which in turn facilitate the derivation of functional limit theorems for our queueing model under suitable heavy-traffic regimes. Third, using the corresponding heavy traffic limits, we asymptotically solve an optimal staffing problem subject to delay-based constraints on the service levels. We find that, in order to achieve the designated service level, such an autoregressive feature in the arrival model translates into notable adjustment in the staffing formula, and such an adjustment can be fully characterized by the parameters of our new arrival model. In this respect, the staffing formulas acknowledge the presence of autoregressive structure in arrivals. Finally, we extend our analysis to queues having customer abandonment and conduct simulation experiments to provide engineering confirmations of our new staffing rules. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","autocorrelation; heavy-traffic approximations; many-server queues; mean-reverting process; non-Poisson arrivals; optimal staffing; parameter uncertainty; queues with customer abandonment","Functional analysis; Hospitals; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Sales; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive features; Doubly stochastic; Functional limit theorem; Heavy traffic limit; Hospital emergency departments; Many server queues; Maximization algorithm; Poisson point process; Personnel selection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096643977

The unexplained serial correlation is accounted for by the generalized multivariate block bootstrap, which resamples two-dimensional arrays of residuals. Different methods of block bootstraps are compared.

The democratic capital stock, which captures the nurturing and strengthening of the policy and decision-making environment and processes, as well as other social institutions in a nation, regardless of the degree of technological development is used as proxy for democracy. This distinguishes our approach from earlier studies of this nature; particularly for developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results suggest that democracy has no direct impact, and perhaps no impact at all on income growth, even though there appears to be many complementarities between democratic institutions and the immediate ingredients of economic development. The results of our analysis are also robust to alternative definitions of democracy. Moreover, the conflictual signals that derive from our sensitivity analyses using the indices of ethno-linguistic fractionalization and the politically relevant ethnic groups further strengthen the nature of the complexities associated with the debate on democracy and income growth in developing countries. In the absence of the democracy variable, our analysis reveals that income growth is significant, even with high ethnolinguistic fractionalization.

Design/methodology/approach: The study traces the career of John Patterson, founder and president of the National Cash Register (NCR) from 1884 to 1922. Data from many different sources, some only recently available through the HathiTrust Digital Library, are analyzed to provide a systematic and focused examination of Patterson’s greatness, as well as some errors in judgment he during his lengthy leadership at NCR. Findings: John Patterson recognized the potential development of a new global industry before it existed and went to work creating it. After he bought the original patents for the cash register, he spent huge sums on research and development and secured hundreds of additional patents on the device. He also spent a fortune on educational advertising to create market demand where none previously existed and invested heavily in developing his salesforce through a strong focus on training, professionalism and high commissions. He also engaged in many unsavory sales practices to try to keep others from encroaching on what he considered his exclusive right to the cash register market. At one point, he was convicted in a criminal proceeding for those efforts and sentenced to prison. Originality/value: This is the first paper to provide a balanced review of Patterson’s contributions to the business history of that era from a sales and marketing perspective.

Unfortunately, productivity has been extremely difficult to operationalize in a repeatable context in the construction sector. The result is a lack of consensus on the basic question of whether there has been improvement or decline in the productivity of the sector. This study focuses on productivity in the housing industry. Productivity is especially important in this industry, as in addition to providing shelter, the housing market is the primary source of wealth accumulation in the US. An individual’s ability to enter this market will be a function of affordability which will be effected by the productivity of the industry. The combination of academic and societal impacts suggests that there is a need to address a fundamental question: what is the status of productivity in the housing industry.

Districts choose their own DMS resources and interoperability effort, and face different interoperability efficiency and technology misfit costs depending on the interoperability approach. We find that any approach can be an equilibrium depending on interoperability efficiency, and that when the social optimum deviates from the equilibrium the socially optimal approach is more centralized. When subsidies and taxes are implemented, the socially optimal interoperability approach can be achieved with budget balance. When only subsidies can be used, the socially optimal approach can be achieved but only under certain interoperability efficiency and misfit cost conditions is there a net social gain. Having an initial level of interoperability causes the equilibrium interoperability approach to shift toward a less centralized one. Our results generalize to other settings characterized by interoperability concerns, collective decisions, and spillovers. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

Toward that end, prescriptive analytics that analyzes health care data to recommend optimal decisions is both relevant and crucial. We develop a novel prescriptive analytics method to improve the cost effectiveness in clinical decision making (CDM), a critical health care dimension that can greatly benefit from analytics. Effective prescriptive analytics for CDM has to address its probabilistic, cost-sensitive, and investment-related characteristics simultaneously. Unlike existing methods that often overlook the investment-related characteristic, the proposed method accounts for all of these characteristics. Specifically, our method considers two sets of costs associated with clinical decisions - before and after an investment - in combination with the probabilities of cost changes due to the investment. In contrast, prevalent methods only emphasize one set of costs, before an investment. Furthermore, the proposed method involves both clinical and investment decisions, whereas existing methods ignore investment decisions. Empirical evaluations with two real-world clinical data sets indicate that the proposed method consistently and significantly outperforms several salient methods from previous research, thereby demonstrating the value of addressing the investment-related characteristic in efforts to improve CDM. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study of three international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)–CARE, Oxfam and Grameen Foundation–provided insights into how they each organize and orchestrate MFIs. We used Pettigrew's (1987, 1990) contextual inquiry framework to guide our data collection and analysis of 20 interviews to understand how capacity building, technology adaptation and outcome measurement interact with content, context and process. Findings: We found that CARE's classical model exemplifies decades of successful MFI service delivery, serving as a benchmark for other NGOs. Oxfam's adaptive model builds on CARE's model to leverage MFIs as platforms for achieving multisectoral outcomes. Finally, Grameen Foundation's innovative model builds on both CARE's classical and Oxfam's adaptive models, using human-centered design and scalable business practices. We also found overlaps between the three models, demonstrating the continuous adaptation of MFI models based on changing contexts, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Students engage in an Excel simulation so they can see for themselves implications of decisions made. Instructors may use a simulation based on the classic Monty Hall problem or a site location decision scenario. In the site location scenario, an initial location for a distribution center is selected (among three possibilities) and the student must decide whether to change this decision based on new information that becomes available. Post workshop results showed that students found this activity to be an effective way of learning about the surprising decision a proper quantitative analysis provides. For faculty teaching probability concepts in operations and supply chain management courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, the workshop is useful in gaining student acceptance of the value in learning application of sometimes esoteric quantitative techniques.

Analysis on the aggregated data showed that subjective norm and trust in information quality positively affected intention to comply with instructions, consistent with the original study. Three follow up analyses provide more nuanced results. First, an abridged dataset was created by filtering out participants whose reasons for non-immediate compliance weren't related to verifying information and then complying. Analysis on this dataset showed that subjective norm no longer positively affected intention to comply. Second, scenarios used in the study were grouped by characteristics such as development speed, frequency, and area affected, and the analysis was redone. Factors affecting intention to comply immediately changed based on the characteristic, with subjective norm positively affected intention to comply in slow-developing scenarios, scenarios that affect at a limited area, and commonly occurring scenarios, while trust in information quality affects the other scenarios. Third, recall of information from the notification was collected from participants and analyzed. Results show that participants who chose to comply immediately recalled more information than others.

Yet, markets still lack credible estimates of how climate change will affect debt sustainability, sovereign creditworthiness and the public finances of major economies. We present a taxonomy for tracing the physical and transition impacts of climate change through to impacts on sovereign risk. We then apply the taxonomy to the UK's potential transition to net zero. Meeting internationally agreed climate targets will require an unprecedented structural transformation of the global economy over the next two or three decades. The changing landscape of risks warrants new risk management and hedging strategies to contain climate risk and minimise the impact of asset stranding and asset devaluation.

Medical errors cause adverse events (AEs) for patients and lead to premature deaths, unintended complications, prolonged hospital stays, and higher medical costs. Although the importance of AE prediction and prevention is well recognized in the information systems literature, there is a dearth of research on modeling and predicting AEs caused by medical errors. Following the design science research paradigm, this study describes the search, design, and evaluation of a novel in-hospital AE prediction model, called Stochastic Autoregressions for Latent Trajectories (SALT). The proposed model uniquely integrates generalized linear mixed model with multitask learning and stochastic time-series processes. Results from our empirical evaluation show that SALT outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in predicting AEs during patients’ hospital stays. Through a simulation, we further demonstrate significant cost savings potential when hospitals implement and integrate SALT in their inpatient care. This study contributes to the design science literature by formalizing the in-hospital AE prediction problem, on the one hand, and developing a novel graphical model to address the prediction problem, on the other. For healthcare practitioners and administrators, our predictive analytics approach unveils important insights to minimize AEs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adverse events; design science; healthcare predictive analytics; HealthTech; medical errors; patient safety","Design; Errors; Forecasting; Hospitals; Learning systems; Medical information systems; Predictive analytics; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Adverse events; Autoregression; Design science; Event prediction; Healthcare predictive analytic; Healthtech; Medical errors; Patient safety; Prediction problem; Stochastics; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122235675

While these decisions may be informed by evidence, the available evidence is often incomplete or imperfect. Therefore, the personal opinions or judgments of senior executives can have an effect. In this paper, we study these effects in two parts: risk-taking and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities. Since a person’s political learning is a relatively stable measure, and is associated with preferences for risk and ESG activities, we examine how the political leanings of the CEOs are related to these effects. Using the data from 2003 to 2016, we find that real estate investment trusts with Democratic-leaning CEOs tend to take more risks, as evidenced by higher levels of leverage and more risk in stock prices. We further find that Democratic-leaning CEOs are more broadly engaged in environmentally oriented ESG activities. © 2021 American Real Estate Society.","corporate social responsibility; decision making; environmental, social, and governance activities; Politics; risk taking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120091004

Aim: In this study the impact of mobile phone technology on agricultural productivity in SSA is examined. Setting: The empirical assessment uses a panel data set covering 41 countries over a period of 25 years. Methods: We employed an econometric approach and panel data covering 41 countries and a 25 year-period (1990–2014) to investigate the effect of the adoption of mobile phone technology and other socio-economic variables on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP). The use of regression analyses allowed us to estimate and measure the contribution of certain variables to agricultural TFP growth in SSA. Results: The results show that the uptake of mobile phone technology had a positive effect on agricultural TFP growth in SSA. Conclusion: Mobile phone technology has been established to be one of the drivers of agricultural productivity in SSA. Implication: The implications of this study are that governments, NGOs, and businesses working on improving agricultural productivity and food security in SSA need to continue endorsing mobile technology as a means to improve agricultural productivity. © 2021.

Poor quality transport infrastructure implies higher travelling times and costs. This indirectly affects the productivity of a region since transportation costs are directly related to sales prices. Therefore, infrastructure investments become important for improving the competitiveness of a region. The problem with these investments is that they take time and require a large amount of money. Consequently, it is extremely important to prioritise this type of investment. This paper will first explain whether transportation investment or a sustainable transportation method affect the exported freight accessibility and if it also affects regional productivity using a linear regression model with the aid of a data-driven geographical information system. It uses spatial separation, gravity, and cumulative opportunity measures to calculate accessibility. Finally, the paper denotes which regions are highly affected by improvements in road, river, and railway networks using Colombia as a case study. The comparison considers travelling time and costs savings under each scenario. The results indicate that the gravity measure was the most appropriate accessibility measure for analysing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The scenario analyses suggest that zones farthest from the seaports are more sensitive to accessibility changes; consequently, they will receive higher improvements in their regional GDP with a national-level implementation of transport infrastructure investments. Thus, project prioritisation should be performed in regions where the investments lead to a decreased travel cost between regions and ports. © 2021 Maria Jubiz-Diaz et al.",,"Economics; Freight transportation; Investments; Ports and harbors; Productivity; Regression analysis; Accessibility measures; Gross domestic products; Infrastructure investment; Linear regression models; Regional productivity; Sustainable transportation; Transport infrastructure; Transportation investments; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115181644

Radical innovation, however, creates challenges for traditional portfolio management systems. When companies do not adequately distinguish between incremental and radical innovation when designing their management systems, portfolio management decision-making processes will tend to favor incremental innovation. Radical innovation requires a broader, multilevel organizational approach. We propose a multilevel framework for innovation portfolios that considers elements at the individual, project, organizational, and strategic levels.

The application of machine learning solves what could be a major stumbling block here.

Liquidity and regulatory capital requirements have gained momentum after the 2008 global financial crisis. Meeting the shareholder’s need (i.e profitability) and regulatory requirements (liquidity and capital) is a delicate balance that banks strive to achieve. Applying a pooled fixed-effects model on a complete panel of 179 banks from 2008 to 2019 in the European Union, the results show how banks in Europe strive to achieve profitability requirements at the same time meeting the regulatory hurdles. The results indicate, better-capitalised banks lend much more, which in turn enhances profitability. Also, the findings indicate that higher capital requirements for banks significantly positively influence liquidity. Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between growth in loans and total regulatory capital. The results imply banks should ensure that the quality of the capital base and the buffers above the regulatory minimum are built up during periods of strong earnings growth. The results also indicate that profitability is significant in influencing the liquidity of the bank. The results emphasise the need to regulate not only the minimum capital requirement but also the liquidity level. © 2021 The Author(s).

They are mandated to work in an entire process – [1] from conception to selling of residential houses. This has been a challenge to the organisation that comes from multiple challenges normally found in developing countries. Objective: A learning objective is sought for technical professionals that rely on single answer decision making to a multi-perspective solution consideration. At the centre of this perspective is taking a collaborative approach with the aim of creating value and effective decision making. Methods: The action research methodology was used where a group of concerned professionals as participants come together to work on organisational challenges. An appreciative inquiry undertone is used to provide positive energy to the participants that has a social constructionist approach to decision making. Results: The collaborative approach to leadership in addition to the value creation and effective decision making led to further cycles of improvement. In-depth analyses of these processes led to findings that these leaders must also take an integrative, questioning and development and learning approach to leadership effectiveness. Conclusion: Organisational change takes time to develop and seen on this research. For instance, the time take to understand that an integrative approach, again there must be a kind of questioning to be learned that involves revealing ones closely held assumptions and lastly leadership as a process requires continuous development and is to be seen as a journey rather than be seen as a finishing line. © 2021","Action Research; Collaboration; Construction; Decision making; Leadership effectiveness; Project Management; Value creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111490827

Traditional CEs require participants to evaluate products based on two-dimensional (2D) visual representations or written lists of attributes. Evidence suggests that product representations can affect how participants perceive attributes, an effect that might be exacerbated in a Low- and Middle-Income Country setting where CEs have seldom been studied. This study examined how physical three-dimensional (3D) prototypes and 2D renderings with written specifications of attribute profiles generated differences in estimated utilities of a CE about a hypothetical new tool for electronic-waste recycling, among workers in North-Eastern Thailand. Two independent CEs were performed with each representation form. Ninety participants across both experiments each ranked three sets of five alternative tool concept solutions from most to least preferred. The results of the conjoint analysis guided the design of a tool optimized for user preferences, which was then distributed to half of the sample through a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction experiment. One month after the auction, participants completed an endline survey. The results point toward potential differences in relative importance of different product attributes based on product representation. Price was found to have no significant impact on the valuation of tools in either experiment. The differences in relative importance of product attributes may have been explained by the limitations of 2D renderings for conveying sizes. Further research is needed to understand the impact of product representation on preferences in this context. We recommend careful consideration for product representations – specifically, how well the representations convey all product attributes being evaluated – in CEs. Using a combination of 2D renderings and 3D product features might have satisfied both the speed and low-cost advantages of renderings while enabling participants to have a better sense of product features. © 2021","Conjoint experiment; Low- and Middle-Income Countries; Physical prototypes; Product representation; Renderings","Statistical methods; Conjoint experiments; Consumer preferences; Electronic waste recycling; Low and middle income countries; Product representation; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Visual representations; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107667126

Remote data collection devices enable the use of sensors to collect user data required to calculate social impact indicators remotely, continuously, and potentially less expensively than other methods that require direct interaction with users. However, many key decisions and questions must be considered during the development and use of such devices to avoid risk of failure. To provide a systematic way for researchers and engineers to consider critical device development questions, the parts of device development and use can be decomposed into Data Identification, Device Design, and Device Deployment. This paper discusses the key decisions within each part of development along with critical questions, common options, and considerations that should be addressed during each part of device development, thus increasing the likelihood of success. A sensor development canvas outlining the key decisions is also provided as a design tool to easily identify deficiencies in the device during development. Considering these critical questions while developing and deploying data collection devices can help researchers and engineers successfully collect social impact indicator data that may be used to ensure engineered products are producing desired positive impacts on individuals. © 2021","Design for the developing world; Development canvas; Engineering for global development; Internet of things; Sensor systems; Social impact","Data acquisition; Developing countries; Product design; Critical questions; Data collection; Data identification; Device development; Direct interactions; Engineered products; Engineering design; Sensor development; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107071891

We draw on a quasi-natural experiment in Sweden, where from 2011 small private firms meeting threshold criteria were exempt from audit. The law resulted in three groups of ventures–(i) those who were above the threshold criteria and continued with an audit, and among those who were exempt some chose to (ii) voluntarily audit or (iii) opted-out of the audit. Starting with ventures established in 2007 (about three years before the passage of the law), and drawing records of the Swedish Companies Registration Office, our results show that while opting out of audit slightly improves the odds of survival, it has detrimental effects when sales volatility or return on assets are high. Those voluntary auditing can realize a higher debt ratio, but also face a decline in sales and net profit. The findings have implications for entrepreneurs in particular and policymakers considering initiation or repealing of audit requirements for ventures. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Auditing; survival; Sweden; venture","entrepreneur; financial market; financial system; industrial investment; industrial performance; policy making; profitability; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104796402

One limitation of existing work is that it has considered immigrants from a given country to be homogenous. However, immigrants differ in various ways, not least in their level of assimilation. This article considers how assimilation might shape diversity’s economic effects. Intuition suggests two conflicting dynamics. Assimilation could lower barriers immigrants and natives face in interacting with one another, and thus enhance benefits. Equally, however, assimilation could reduce heuristic differences between immigrants and native-born workers, dampening spillovers from diversity. We use linked employer–employee data from Norway to test these ideas. We construct diversity indices at the regional and workplace scale to capture different aspects of assimilation, and observe how these are related to worker productivity, proxied using wages. We find that assimilation dampens externalities from immigrant diversity. Diversity among second-generation or childhood migrants offers smaller benefits than diversity in teenage or adult arrivals. Immigrants’ cultural proximity to Norway, and their experience of tertiary education in Norway, each also reduce the social return to diversity.

Design/methodology/approach: The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is applied to validate and eliminate challenges in sustainability transition regarding qualitative information. Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) is used to build a hierarchical framework under uncertainties. Findings: This study finds that technology investment, data management, eco-management and sociospatial embedding challenges are the highest hierarchical framework levels and affect CST. Practical implications: A lack of awareness and knowledge, a lack of commitment, a lack of strategy, tolerance of unsustainable practices, a lack of stakeholder participation and a fragmented market are perceived as the challenges that show the highest driving and dependence power. These challenges serve as a reference for government and construction firms in the transition to sustainable corporate practices. Originality/value: Unsustainable corporate practices have caused large amounts of energy consumption, resource depletion and environmental impacts. There are challenges in transitioning to corporate sustainability that must be addressed. The most significant challenges that need to be solved to facilitate the transition to corporate sustainability are identified and arranged in a hierarchical model. By identifying the hierarchical relationships among the challenges, a theoretical framework that extends the existing models is developed to assist decision-makers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate sustainability; Corporate sustainability transition challenges; Fuzzy Delphi method; Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling","Construction industry; Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Investments; Uncertainty analysis; Corporate-sustainability; Design/methodology/approach; Interpretive structural modeling; Qualitative information; Stakeholder participation; Sustainability transition; Technology investments; Theoretical framework; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104274885

These projections were used to assess the impact of proposals to improve arable yields, change diet and reduce consumer waste under two contrasting political ideologies, protectionist or free trade, on the proportions and rate of change of agricultural land use. The model does not calculate what is possible to achieve but what is probable, given the simulated processes, which are based on landowner satisficing behaviour and government political ideologies. Our main finding is that protectionist policies produced the least change. We also found that arable crop yield improvements, dietary change and waste reduction promoted pasture over arable use because these drivers reduced arable income on marginal arable land. The proportion of land in private and farm-forestry, a land use proposed as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measure, reduced, when private and farm-forestry was not a protected use and when there were no incentives to plant or maintain trees. © 2021 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Q methodology [Q] uses empirical evidence to differentiate subjective views and, therefore, behaviors in relation to any topic. Q uses the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research methods to reveal and describe the multiple, divergent viewpoints that exist within a group where individuals sort statements into a grid to represent their views. Analyses group similar views (sorts). In this study, participants were selected from a range of types related to cybersecurity (experts, authorities and uninformed). Findings: Four unique viewpoints emerged such that one represents cybersecurity best practices and the remaining three viewpoints represent poor cybersecurity behaviors (Naïve Cybersecurity Practitioners, Worried but not Vigilant and How is Cybersecurity a Big Problem) that indicate a need for educational interventions within both the public and private sectors. Practical implications: Understanding the divergent views about cybersecurity is important within smaller groups including classrooms, technology-based college majors, a company, a set of IT professionals or other targeted groups where understanding cybersecurity viewpoints can reveal the need for training, changes in behavior and/or the potential for security breaches which reflect the human factors of cybersecurity. Originality/value: A review of the literature revealed that only large, nation-wide surveys have been used to investigate views of cybersecurity.

A panel Granger causality test and a system generalized method of moments (GMM) are also utilized in this study. Cultural trade is characterized by exports and imports of cultural goods. The results indicate there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between gross domestic product, total exports, capital formation and labour force.

In total, out of 360 questionnaires distributed, 255 responses were coded for analysis resulting in a response rate of 71%. Structural equation modeling, mediation and moderation analyses were applied. Findings: Perceptions of managerial indecisiveness strengthen role ambiguity, which negatively impacts trust in the manager, which in turn increases turnover intentions. The level of participative leadership moderates the link between indecisiveness and role ambiguity. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies in the sales literature that examines how managerial indecisiveness, role ambiguity and trust in the supervisor can impact salespersons' turnover intentions.

Regression analysis and descriptive statistics suggest peripheral routes with a small market size are natural monopolies, where passengers pay higher prices. We estimate a structural model, currently absent from the literature, which shows that these routes are characterized by lower welfare levels. The model allows us to simulate a policy promoting competition on such routes showing that a regulator could generate net welfare gains by implementing a more competitive equilibrium on these routes.

Extensive data are collected on all aspects of how customers interact or experience the products or services. Research has shown the importance of the “peak-end” rule in service design; that is, providing a customer with good “peak” service levels and “ending” the service experience with high quality can enhance customer satisfaction and build loyalty. However, previous studies have examined this phenomenon only in contexts with unidimensional service levels. We introduce peak cubes, which enable service designers and scholars to pinpoint prominent service levels in multidimensional service experience profiles—thereby extending current research on behavioral economics and service design to more general settings. Results indicate the potential of multidimensional peak-end models to better predict customer satisfaction in various service scenarios. Using Shapley values in coalitional game theory, the resulting models can also inform service designers about the quality dimensions that are critical from the perspective of multidimensional peak-end heuristic and customer satisfaction.

In this paper, we will propose a neural network-based decision scheme that gives the user an advanced decision support feature of specifying proportional weights between characteristics that does not exist in any other blockchain type decision scheme and solve the drawbacks available in existing schemes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adoption; blockchain; decision making; neural networks","Blockchain; Decision support systems; Decision supports; Fine grains; Flow diagram; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092309602

Unfortunately, such levels of personalisation can be difficult to accomplish for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, particularly when the fixed cost of personalised marketing is significant. This paper considers methods for providing customised promotions to customers in the form of weekly flyers. We consider how multiple versions of a weekly flyer can be used by a retailer, which products should be included in each flyer version, and how customer preferences, markup, and inventory considerations impact these decisions. Specifically, transaction histories are used to estimate customer preferences for various product offerings using market basket analysis. These probabilities are then incorporated into an optimisation model for grouping customers into market segments and presenting option sets within each segment that maximise expected marginal profits across the flyers. A heuristic is proposed for solving larger problems and evaluated against lower and upper bounds on the optimal profit. Computational results indicate that leveraging customer transaction data to optimise the product selection and assignment of four unique flyers can increase profit by 7.7% over the optimal single-flyer solution. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytics; flyer customisation; optimisation; retail","Commerce; Optimization; Profitability; Computational results; Customer preferences; Lower and upper bounds; Market basket analysis; Optimisation models; Product offerings; Product selection; Transaction history; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083561294

Analysis of one-on-one interviews conducted with hospitality managers in Ohio identified interpersonal behavior and guest-service attitude as most important attributes of successful hires. While background checking and drug testing were perceived to be effective for all employees, personality and general mental ability (GMA) tests were viewed as more effective when screening management employees. Differences were noted in time needed to determine whether hires were successful for frontline versus management positions. Managerial implications are discussed. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","drug; frontline; GMA; human resources; management; person-job fit; person-organization; personality; Preemployment test; skilled; unskilled",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057302905
